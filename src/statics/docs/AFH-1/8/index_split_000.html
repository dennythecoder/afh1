	<p class="block_5">Military customs and courtesies are proven traditions that explain what should and should not be done in many situations. They are acts of respect and courtesy when dealing with other people, and have evolved as a result of the need for order, as well as the mutual respect and sense of fraternity that exists among military personnel. Military customs and courtesies go beyond basic politeness; they play an extremely important role in building morale, esprit de corps, discipline, and mission effectiveness. Customs and courtesies ensure proper respect for the military members and build the foundation for self-discipline. Customs and courtesies are outlined in four sections: Symbols, Professional Behavior, Drill and Ceremony, and Honor Guard. Not all-inclusive, this chapter highlights many of the customs and courtesies that make the Air Force and its people special.</p>

	<p class="block_6">8.2. The United States (U.S.) Flag.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The flag of the U.S. has not been created by rhetorical sentences in declarations of independence and in bills of rights. It has been created by the experience of a great people, and nothing is written upon it that has not been written by their life. It is the embodiment, not of a sentiment, but of a history.</p>

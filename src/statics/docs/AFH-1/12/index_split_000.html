	<p class="block_">TRAINING AND EDUCATION</p>
	<p class="block_1">Section 12A—Overview</p>
	<p class="block_2">12.1. Introduction.</p>
	<p class="block_3">A "job" does not guarantee success, however, effective On the Job Training; Job Knowledge, Job Proficiency and Job Experience will ultimately lead to a successful career and with continued Education and Training, a solid national defense. On-the-job training (OJT) has been around since the beginning of history and has been used in the United States by both public and private industries for many years. Today, most successful companies have effective OJT programs because OJT works. Well-trained workers mean higher production, positive morale, greater profits, and higher wages. Air Force training costs millions of dollars annually, for good reason. To accomplish the mission, whether that means satellites in orbit, planes in the air, reports to higher headquarters, or vehicles on the road, training is a must. In addition to OJT, training management covers upgrade training, skill levels, retraining, and training responsibilities, forms, and documentation. Finally, each base education office provides Service members with educational opportunities in which they may voluntarily participate during off-duty time or other times, as authorized by military policies. The base education office also provides information on financial assistance and commissioning programs.</p>

	<p class="block_4"><b class="calibre1">12.2. Education and Training Purpose.</b> </p>
	<p class="block_3">Skilled and trained personnel are critical to the Air Force in providing a strong national defense capability. The Air Force OJT program provides training for personnel to attain knowledge and skill qualifications required to perform duties in their specialty. </p>
	<p class="block_2">12.3. Strategy.</p>
	<p class="block_3">Develop, manage, and execute realistic and flexible training programs to produce a highly skilled, motivated force capable of carrying out all tasks and functions in support of the Air Force mission. These programs should provide the foundation for Air Force readiness. </p>
	<p class="block_4"><b class="calibre1">12.4. Training and Mission Accomplishment.</b> </p>
	<p class="block_3">Training is an integral part of the unit’s mission. An effective training program requires commander and supervisory involvement at all levels. </p>
	<p class="block_2">12.5. Training and Airman Career Program.</p>
	<p class="block_3">Supervisors must take an active role in the trainee’s career progression and<b class="calibre1"> </b>explain<b class="calibre1"> </b>the relationship between training and career progression. While the supervisor’s primary responsibility is to plan a program that outlines specific short-term, mission-related goals for the trainee, overall success depends on the supervisor’s ability to advise and assist Airmen in reaching their long-range career objectives. </p>
	<p class="block_2">12.6. Training Components.</p>
	<p class="block_3">The Air Force OJT program consists of three components:</p>
	<p class="block_3">12.6.1. <b class="calibre1">Job Knowledge</b>—satisfied through career development courses (CDC) designed to provide career knowledge, general task, and deployment/unit type code task knowledge applicable to the Air Force specialty code that is gained through a planned program of study involving CDCs or technical references listed in the applicable career field education and training plan (CFETP) across a wide spectrum of subjects pertaining to a career field. When CDCs are not available, trainees study the applicable technical references identified by the supervisor and/or CFETP.</p>
	<p class="block_3">12.6.2. <b class="calibre1">Job Proficiency</b>—hands-on training provided on the job, allowing the trainee to gain proficiency in tasks performed in the work center.</p>
	<p class="block_3">12.6.3. <b class="calibre1">Job Experience</b>—gained during and after upgrade training to build confidence and competence.</p>
	<p class="block_2">12.7. Upgrade Training. </p>
	<p class="block_3">Upgrade training is the key to the total training program. It leads to award of the higher skill level and is designed to increase skills and abilities. Air Force specialty code upgrade training requirements for award of 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels are outlined in Chapter 4 of AFI 36-2201, <i class="calibre2">Air Force Training Program</i>, AFI 36-2101, <i class="calibre2">Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), </i>and the applicable CFETP. </p>

Before submitting members for upgrade, ensure the trainee, as a minimum, meets all mandatory requirements as defined in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory, CFETP, and the Air Force job qualification standard (AFJQS). </p>
	<p class="block_3">12.9.3.<b class="calibre1"> Trainer.</b> </p>
	<p class="block_5">The trainer and supervisor may be the same individual. If necessary, the supervisor may assign someone else to provide the training. Trainers are selected based on their experience and ability to provide instruction to the trainees. Additionally, they must maintain task qualification and complete the Air Force Training Course. Trainer responsibilities include planning, conducting, and documenting training; preparing and using teaching outlines or task breakdowns, as necessary; developing evaluation tools; and briefing the trainee and supervisor on the training evaluation results. </p>
	<p class="block_3">12.9.4.<b class="calibre1"> Task Certifier.</b> </p>
	<p class="block_5">Task certifiers provide third-party certification and evaluation on tasks identified by the Air Force Career Field Manager, if applicable. The certifier must conduct additional evaluations and certify qualification on those designated tasks. Certifiers must be at least a staff sergeant with a 5-skill level or civilian equivalent, attend the Air Force Training Course, and be capable of evaluating the task being certified. Certifiers will develop evaluation tools or use established training evaluation tools and methods to determine the trainee’s ability and training program effectiveness and will brief the trainee, supervisor, and trainer on the training evaluation results. </p>
	<p class="block_3">12.9.5.<b class="calibre1"> Trainee.</b> </p>
	<p class="block_5">The trainee is the focal point of the Air Force training program. Trainees must make every effort to become qualified to perform in their Air Force specialty. The success and quality of trainee training greatly depends on the relationship between the supervisor, trainer, and trainee. Trainees must:</p>
	<p class="block_5">12.9.5.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Actively participate in all opportunities for upgrade and qualification training.</p>
	<p class="block_5">12.9.5.2. Comprehend the applicable CFETP requirements and career path.</p>

	<p class="block_3">12.10.1.<b class="calibre1"> Air Force Form 623.</b> </p>
	<p class="block_5">The Air Force Form 623 (or electronic equivalent) is the standard folder used as a training record. The form reflects past and current qualifications and is used to determine training requirements. Supervisors maintain the Air Force Form 623 for all assigned personnel according to AFI 36-2201.<i class="calibre2"> </i>The form is available to all personnel in the chain of command, including the UTM, upon request. Return the form to the member upon separation, retirement, commissioning, or promotion to master sergeant, unless otherwise directed by the Air Force Career Field Manager. <b class="calibre1">Exception:</b> Do not give Air Force Forms 623 containing classified information to the individual.</p>
	<p class="block_3">12.10.2.<b class="calibre1"> Career Field Education and Training Program (CFETP).</b> </p>
	<p class="block_5">The CFETP is a comprehensive core document identifying life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, core and home station training, and deployment/Unit Type Code task requirements for a specialty. Supervisors use the CFETP to plan, prioritize, manage, and execute training within the career field. CFETPs are used to identify and certify all past and current qualifications. Keep at least one copy of the entire CFETP (Part I and II), in the work center for general access and master training plan development. Unless otherwise directed by the Air Force Career Field Manager, work center supervisors may file only Part II of the CFETP, with cover page and identification page, in the Air Force Form 623, or equivalent form. If the CFETP is divided into distinct sections (by aircraft, duty position, or mission, etc.) then file only the sections applicable to the individual, such as current/past qualifications, and current upgrade/duty position training requirements.</p>
	<p class="block_5">12.10.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Part I.</b> Provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty and is maintained as part of the work center master training plan.</p>

	<p class="block_3">12.10.8.<b class="calibre1"> Master Training Plan.</b></p>
	<p class="block_5">The master training plan employs a strategy for ensuring all work center job requirements are completed by using a master task listing. The master training plan provides milestones for tasks and CDC completion, and prioritizes deployment/Unit Type Code, home station training, upgrade, and qualification tasks.</p>
	<p class="block_2">12.11. Career Development Course Program Management:</p>
	<p class="block_3">12.11.1.<b class="calibre1"> Purpose and Scope:</b></p>
	<p class="block_5">12.11.1.1. CDCs are published to provide the information necessary to satisfy the career knowledge component of OJT. These courses are developed from references identified in the CFETP that correlate with mandatory knowledge items listed in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory. CDCs must contain information on basic principles, techniques, and procedures common to an Air Force specialty code. They do not contain information on specific equipment or tasks unless the specific equipment or task best illustrates a procedure or technique having utility to the entire Air Force specialty code.</p>
	<p class="block_5">12.11.1.2. Headquarters Air University/A4L electronically publishes an “Air Force specialty code listing of CDC requirements, identifying all mandatory CDCs for skill-level upgrade.” The list is available on the Headquarters Air University/A4L website at <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/afiadl/" class="text_1">http://www.au.af.mil/au/afiadl/</a> under the Course and Admin Information tab.</p>
	<p class="block_3">12.11.2.<b class="calibre1"> CDC Administration:</b></p>
	<p class="block_5">12.11.2.1. If available, supervisors will use CDCs to satisfy career knowledge requirements for upgrade training.</p>
	<p class="block_5">12.11.2.2. If a CDC becomes available after entering upgrade training, the individual does not have to take the CDC, unless specified by the Air Force Career Field Manager.</p>
	<p class="block_5">12.11.2.3. The UTM will ensure trainees are enrolled in required CDC material within 45 days of in-processing (within 60 days for overseas units).</p>
	<p class="block_5">12.11.2.4. Within 10 duty days of receipt, the UTM issues CDC material to the supervisor and trainee and briefs them on proper use of the CDC and documents the trainee’s Air Force IMT 623A or equivalent automated training record.</p>
	<p class="block_5">12.11.2.5. The supervisor determines volume sequence of study, sets the overall course completion schedule, and develops a tracking system to monitor progress. Each volume must be completed within 30 days. (<b class="calibre1">Exception:</b> The UTM may grant an extension due to mission requirements. Air Reserve Component and individual mobilization augmentees have 60 days.) If necessary, the supervisor determines the reason for slow progress, counsels the trainee, documents the counseling on Air Force IMT 623A or automated version, and places the trainee in supervised study. </p>
	<p class="block_5">12.11.2.6. The trainee answers the unit review exercise questions. The unit review exercise is an “open book” teaching device. The trainee transfers answers to the field scoring sheet. The supervisor scores the unit review exercise, conducts review training on the areas missed, fills in the bottom of the scoring sheet, places the field scoring sheet in the Air Force Form 623 or automated training records, counsels the trainee, and documents Air Force IMT 623A or automated version. The supervisor will conduct a comprehensive review of the entire CDC with the trainee in preparation for the course examination and documents the review on the Air Force IMT 623A or automated version.</p>
	<p class="block_5"><span class="calibre4">12.11.2.7. The supervisor will notify the UTM to schedule and order the course examination.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_5">12.11.2.8. If the trainee receives a satisfactory result, the supervisor conducts and documents review training, then signs and places the course examination scorecard in the Air Force Form 623 or automated training records until the trainee completes upgrade training or qualification training.</p>
	<p class="block_5">12.11.2.9. If the trainee receives an unsatisfactory result, the unit commander, with help from the UTM or base training manager, interviews the supervisor and trainee to determine reason for failure and corrective action required within 30 days from initial notification (90 days for Air Reserve Component and individual mobilization augmentees). The supervisor documents the counseling on Air Force IMT 623A or automated version, places the trainee in supervised review training, and forwards a copy of the evaluation to the base training office.</p>
	<p class="block_6">12.11.2.10. If the trainee receives a second unsatisfactory course examination result, the unit commander, with assistance from the UTM or base training manager, interviews the supervisor and trainee to determine reason for failure within 30 days from initial notification (90 days for Air Reserve Component and individual mobilization augmentees). After reviewing the facts, the unit commander decides on one of the following options: (1) Evaluate for possible CDC waiver (do not place trainee into Training Status Code T); (2) Withdraw the Airman for failing to progress, place into Training Status Code T, and pursue separation; (3) Withdraw the Airman for failing to progress, place into Training Status Code T, request Air Force specialty code withdrawal, and recommend retraining or return to a previously awarded Air Force specialty code; or (4) Withdraw Airman for failing to progress, place into Training Status Code T, reevaluate at 90 days, and pursue either option 1, 2, or 3 as appropriate. </p>
	<p class="block_1">Section 12C—Community College of the Air Force</p>
	<p class="block_2">12.12. Community College of the Air Force:</p>
	<p class="block_3">12.12.1. The Community College of the Air Force is the largest community college in the world and is the only community college in the Department of Defense exclusively for enlisted personnel. The mission of the Community College of the Air Force is to offer and award job-related associate in applied science degrees and other academic credentials that enhance mission readiness, contribute to recruiting, assist in retention and support the career transitions of Air Force enlisted members. Community College of the Air Force awards the associate in applied science degree to enlisted members of the Regular Air Force, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve Command. Community College of the Air Force offers over 70 degree programs in 5 general areas: (1) Aircraft and Missile Maintenance; (2) Allied Health; (3) Electronics and Telecommunications; (4) Logistics and Resources; and (5) Public and Support Services. Enlisted Airmen may only participate in degree programs specifically designed for their Air Force occupational specialty. Community College of the Air Force also offers programs and other academic credentials that support professional development, professional certification, and recognition opportunities.</p>
	<p class="block_3"><span class="calibre4">12.12.2. The Community College of the Air Force was activated in 1972 to gain academic recognition for formal technical training conducted by Air Force schools. From 1980 to 2004, Community College of the Air Force was independently accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. Today, Community College of the Air Force shares in Air University’s regional accreditation through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_3">12.12.3. The Community College of the Air Force administrative center is located at Maxwell Air Force Base, Gunter Annex, Alabama. More than 6,500 instructors assigned to more than 100 affiliated schools deliver more than 2,000 degree-applicable courses for which collegiate credit is earned. Each year more than 1.6 million semester hours are earned in Community College of the Air Force classrooms. To date, Community College of the Air Force has awarded more than 480,000 associate of applied science degrees. </p>
	<p class="block_7">12.12.4. A<b class="calibre1">ssociate in Applied Science Degree.</b><span class="calibre4"> Associate degrees earned in professional, technical or terminal programs are frequently called associate of applied science degrees. The educational standard for the associate in applied science degree is to be designed for those students who plan to seek employment based upon the competencies and skills attained through these programs and to offer the academic, technical and professional knowledge and skills required for job acquisition, retention and advancement. While not designed to meet the needs of students who transfer to a four-year institution, portions of these programs may do so. Community College of the Air Force offers and awards the associate in applied science degree designed to provide graduates with knowledge, skills and theoretical background for enhanced performance as technicians within their respective Air Force occupational specialty. This is accomplished by combining collegiate credit earned through completed formal technical training courses delivered at affiliated military schools and general education courses completed from accredited civilian colleges. Since enlisted Airmen are constantly relocating in performance of their duties, Community College of the Air Force provides a means for them to complete degree requirements regardless of where they are assigned. One way the Community College of the Air Force helps enlisted Airmen to progress toward completing degree requirements while deployed, on temporary duty, or at multiple duty locations is through General Education Mobile. General Education Mobile identifies civilian colleges that provide distance learning courses approved by the Community College of the Air Force in meeting degree program general education requirements. This prevents Airmen from completing unnecessary courses that would not apply toward degree graduation requirements, eliminates waste of military tuition assistance funds, and prevents wasting Airmen’s time and efforts.    </span></p>
	<p class="block_3">12.12.5. Enlisted Airmen are automatically registered in the Community College of the Air Force degree program designed for their Air Force occupational specialty during the fourth week of Basic Military Training. Each degree program consists of 64 semester hours and combines Air Force formal technical training and education with a core of general education requirements obtained from accredited civilian colleges or nationally recognized examination programs. To graduate, students must complete the 64 semester-hour academic requirements, hold at least the Journeyman 5-skill level (or equivalent), and have a minimum of 16 semester hours of Community College of the Air Force residency credit applied toward the degree program. Residency is defined as credit earned in a Community College of the Air Force affiliated school or credit awarded for occupational specialty progression. Table 12.1 identifies the requirements for the typical Community College of the Air Force degree and the semester-hour requirements in each subject area.</p>
	<p class="block_7">12.12.6. <b class="calibre1">Collegiate Credit.</b> Community College of the Air Force awards collegiate academic credit for degree-applicable courses delivered at affiliated military schools. However, not all Air Force training courses are awarded Community College of the Air Force academic credit. The college accepts credit in transfer from accredited colleges to be applied toward specific degree program requirements. General education courses accepted in transfer from civilian colleges must meet Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges accreditation and Community College of the Air Force requirements. Refer to the Community College of the Air Force General Catalog for policies concerning acceptance of civilian general education courses in transfer. Community College of the Air Force also researches and awards technical credit for degree-applicable federal and civilian professional credentials (certifications, licensures, and registries). Students may earn Community College of the Air Force collegiate credit for specific national professional credentials that are approved by the college to satisfy applicable degree program technical education and program elective requirements. To determine which professional credentials can be awarded credit and used in a specific degree program, refer to the current Community College of the Air Force General Catalog at <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/" class="text_1">http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/</a>.</p>

	<p class="block_5">Credentialing is a critical element of enlisted professional development. During the certification process, enlisted Airmen gain advanced levels of knowledge and skills beyond their job qualification training. Blending Air Force technical training and education with industry-based skill sets and professional certification processes benefits the Air Force by molding a more diverse and qualified workforce to maintain critical and valuable national defense assets. The Airman benefits by being provided the education and credentials needed in highly technical Air Force career fields. The Airman will also possess highly valued skills needed by industry when he or she transitions out of the Air Force. The end result is industry benefits immensely by receiving a highly trained, qualified, experienced, and disciplined employee, which is a valuable payback of investments. To support documentary evidence of training, skills, and practical experience, Airmen are highly encouraged to maintain records of all previous and current education, training, and qualifications.</p>

	<p class="block_4"><b class="calibre1">12.15.</b> <b class="calibre1">Educational</b> <b class="calibre1">Financial Assistance.</b></p>
	<p class="block_3">The Voluntary Education Program supports long-range Air Force goals for maintaining a high-quality force and enhancing professional and personal development, recruitment, retention, and readiness. The Air Force offers three programs for enlisted personnel to help defray the cost of obtaining off-duty education:</p>
	<p class="block_3">12.15.1.<b class="calibre1"> Military Tuition Assistance.</b></p>
	<p class="block_5">To assist individuals in furthering their education, the Air Force provides a tuition assistance program (with some restrictions) to all eligible Air Force members. As of 1 October 2014, the Air Force pays the cost of tuition only at accredited institutions not to exceed the hourly and annual caps established by DoDI 1322.25, <i class="calibre2">Voluntary Education</i> <i class="calibre2">Programs,</i> and AFI 36-2649, <i class="calibre2">Voluntary Education</i> <i class="calibre2">Program.</i> These funds are not taxed thus lowering the tax deduction in an Airman’s paycheck. Air Force members cannot use tuition assistance to purchase textbooks, ebooks, career development courses/DVDs, references/instructional materials, electronic equipment/supplies, certificate/license examinations and all fees regardless of applicability to course enrollment or institutional reimbursement policy. Students using military tuition assistance whose tuition exceeds the semester hour cap may use the top-up benefit in their Montgomery GI Bill or Post 9/11 GI Bill to cover the remaining portion.</p>
	<p class="block_3">12.15.2.<b class="calibre1"> Montgomery GI Bill.</b></p>
	<p class="block_5">Eligible individuals who entered the service for the first time on or after 1 July 1985 are enrolled in the Montgomery GI Bill. Members who participate have their pay reduced by $100 a month for the first 12 months. What looks like a contribution of $1,200 is actually a little more than $900 because no taxes are paid on the $1,200. Participants may also elect to contribute an additional $600, which adds a maximum of $5,400 to the total benefit package. In-service use of the Montgomery GI Bill is permitted after 2 years of continuous active duty. Benefits expire 10 years after separation or retirement. <b class="calibre1">Note: </b>The amount of the total benefit is adjusted each year in relation to the cost of living index. </p>
	<p class="block_21"> </p>
	<p class="block_3">12.15.3.<b class="calibre1"> Post-9-11 GI Bill.</b></p>

	<p class="block_">PERSONNEL PROGRAMS</p>
	<p class="block_1">Section 15A—Overview</p>
	<p class="block_2">15.1. Introduction.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.1.1. The Air Force requires military members to be prepared to serve and support the mission at all times. Force support organizations ensure Airmen and their families are cared for, pay and entitlements are properly addressed, and their individual rights are secure. Airmen need to comprehend the enlisted assignments, family care, reenlistment and retraining opportunities, benefits and services, personnel records and individual rights, the awards and decorations program, and the enlisted promotion systems programs and policies. Each of these areas has an impact, in some form or fashion, on every Airman; therefore, understanding the individual nuances associated with each of these programs is a necessity for all Airmen. The senior NCO promotion program, manpower management and requirements, competitive sourcing, and civilian personnel management programs, are all necessary areas of focus for our aspiring senior NCOs. A basic understanding of these subject areas are required to effectively lead Airmen and manage programs.</p>
	<p class="block_4">15.1.2. The Air Force mission requires military members to be prepared for service at all times. Mission support organizations ensure Airmen's families are cared for; pay and entitlements are properly addressed; and individual rights are secured. This chapter includes information on enlisted assignments, family care, reenlistment and retraining opportunities, benefits and services, personnel records, individual rights, the awards and decorations program, and the enlisted promotion system.</p>
	<p class="block_1">Section 15B—Enlisted Assignments</p>
	<p class="block_5"><b class="calibre1">15.2.</b> <b class="calibre1">General Information.</b></p>
	<p class="block_3">Qualified Airmen must be in the right jobs at the right time to accomplish the Air Force mission. The Air Force classifies and assigns Airmen worldwide as equitably as possible to ensure a high state of readiness. The Air Force also recognizes a need for special assignment considerations to take care of Air Force Airmen with exceptional needs. The Air Force uses a coherent and logical classification system to identify valid manpower requirements, to identify and describe each Air Force occupational specialty, to ensure minimum prerequisite standards are set for each specialty, and to ensure qualified Airmen are placed into each specialty. While the primary consideration in selecting Airmen for reassignment is the Airmen’s qualifications to accomplish the mission, the Air Force also considers additional factors:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.2.1. To the maximum extent possible, the Air Force assigns Airmen on a voluntary basis and in the most equitable manner feasible.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.2.2. The Air Force equitably distributes involuntary assignments among similarly qualified Airmen to minimize family separation and to avoid creating a severe personal hardship on Airmen.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.2.3. Limitations may be established on involuntary selection for permanent change of station following some temporary duties to allow Airmen to attend essential military and personal pre-permanent change of station requirements, as well as to reduce Airmen and family turbulence.</p>
	<p class="block_5"><b class="calibre1">15.3. Assignment Authority.</b> </p>
	<p class="block_3">The Department of Defense allocates funds, delegates authority, and directs policies for the permanent change of station assignment of Airmen to satisfy national security requirements. Permanent change of station assignments may also be directed to ensure equitable treatment of Airmen, such as permanent change of station from overseas to the continental United States upon completion of the prescribed overseas tour. Air Force Instruction 36-2110, <i class="calibre2">Assignments,</i> is the governing instruction for operational (including rotational), training (including formal education and professional military education) and force structure assignments.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Assignment Requests. </b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The director of assignments (or equivalent) in coordination with major commands, field operating agencies, and direct reporting units is authorized to initiate assignments for Airmen currently assigned to major commands, field operating agencies, or direct reporting units to fill valid vacant manpower authorizations. Air Force Personnel Center is the final approval authority for Airman assignments. The Airman Assignment Division is the final approval authority for Airman <span class="text_">assignments</span> in the grades of Senior Master Sergeant and below. The Chiefs Group is the final approval authority for Chief Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant-select assignments. </p>
	<p class="block_7"> </p>
	<p class="block_7"> </p>
	<p class="block_3">15.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Distribution of Personnel.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Airmen are distributed to meet the overall needs of the Air Force according to law and Department of Defense and Air Force directives and <span class="text_">instructions</span>; as equitably as possible between major commands, within a specialty and grade; according to guidance from the Air Staff functional area office of primary responsibility; and as directed by the <span class="text_">designated</span> assignment authority outlined in AFI 36-2110.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.4. Assignment Policy and Procedures:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.4.1.<b class="calibre1"> Equal Opportunity.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The Air Force assigns Airmen without regard to color, race, religious preference (except chaplains), national origin, ethnic background, age, marital status (except military couples), spouse’s employment, education or volunteer service activities of spouse, or gender (except as provided for by statute or other policies). This applies to both permanent change of station <span class="text_">and</span> temporary duty assignments. The primary factor in selecting Airmen for permanent change of station is the Airmen’s qualifications to fill a valid manpower requirement and perform productively in the position for which being considered. When Airmen with the required qualifications are identified, then permanent change of station eligibility criteria and other factors are considered.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> Special Experience Identifier.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The special experience identifier system complements the assignment process and is used in conjunction with grade, Air Force specialty code, Air Force specialty code prefixes and suffixes, etc., to match uniquely qualified Airmen to jobs with special requirements. Special experience identifiers may be used when specific experience or training is critical to the job, and no other means is appropriate or available. The special experience identifier system is <span class="text_">also</span> used to rapidly identify Airmen to meet unique circumstances, contingency requirements, or other critical needs. Manpower positions are coded with a special experience identifier to identify positions that require or provide unique experiences or qualifications. The personnel records for the Airmen who earn a special experience identifier are similarly coded.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.4.3. <b class="calibre1">Security Access Requirement.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Manpower positions often require Airmen assigned to have access to a specified level of classified information. However, <span class="text_">sometimes</span> the urgency to fill a position does not allow selection of Airmen using permanent change of station eligibility criteria and subsequent processing (and/or investigation) for access at the specified level. Under these circumstances, selection may be necessary from among Airmen who currently have access or can be granted access immediately. </p>
	<p class="block_3">15.4.4.<b class="calibre1"> Grade, Air Force Specialty Code, and Skill-Level Relationship for Assignment.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Chief Master Sergeants and Chief Master Sergeant-selects may be assigned in any Air Force specialty code or chief enlisted manager code they possess or are qualified to be awarded. Normally, Airmen in the grade of Senior Master Sergeants and below are selected for assignment in their control Air Force specialty code. Airmen with an incompatible grade and control Air Force specialty code skill level because of retraining or reclassification are selected for assignment and allocated against requirements commensurate with their grade, regardless of their control Air Force specialty code skill level. Normally, Airmen are selected based on their <span class="text_">grade</span> and skill level. Chief Master Sergeants fill chief enlisted manager code positions; Senior Master Sergeants fill 9-skill level positions; Master Sergeants and Technical Sergeants fill 7-skill level positions; Staff Sergeants and Senior Airman fill 5-skill level positions; and Airman First Class, Airman, and Airman Basic fill 3-skill level positions.</p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="text_1">15.4.5. </span><span class="text_2">Volunteer Status and P</span><span class="text_3">ermanent Change of Station</span><span class="text_2"> Eligibility.</span></p>
	<p class="block_6">Within a group of qualified Airmen who meet the minimum eligibility criteria for permanent change of station selection, volunteers are selected ahead of nonvolunteers. Furthermore, nonvolunteers qualified to fill a requirement who meet the minimum permanent change of station eligibility criteria are selected ahead of qualified volunteers who do not meet permanent change of station eligibility criteria. For example, time on station is a permanent change of station eligibility requirement. A qualified volunteer who meets the minimum time on station <span class="text_">requirement</span> is considered first in order of longest on station. Next, the qualified nonvolunteer who meets the time on station requirement in the order of longest on station, and finally the qualified volunteer who does not meet the time on station requirement may be <span class="text_4">considered; however, qualified volunteer will require a </span>time on station<span class="text_4"> waiver</span>.</p>
	<p class="block_7"> </p>
	<p class="block_7"> </p>
	<p class="block_7"> </p>
	<p class="block_3">15.4.6. <b class="calibre1">Chief Master Sergeant Development.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Headquarters Air Force/DPE uses the Chief Master Sergeant assignment policies to support the continued development of Chief Master Sergeants. Because Chief Master Sergeants are Air Force senior leaders, these policies are comparable with other senior leader assignment and development methods. <span class="text_">Policies</span> include:</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.6.1.<b class="calibre1"> Three-year Limits for Headquarters Staff and Special Duty Tours. </b>Chief Master Sergeants serving in major command, Headquarters Air Force, and Joint Staff positions, as well as special duty positions will be limited to serving 3-year tours. This increases the opportunities for Chief Master Sergeants to serve in these positions, enhancing their development. Additionally, this improves the flow of field experience into headquarters staff positions and staff experience into base-<span class="text_">level</span> units.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.6.2.<b class="calibre1"> Date Eligible for Return from Overseas (DEROS) Management. </b>DEROS adjustment requests, like DEROS extensions, indefinite DEROSs, and in-place consecutive overseas tours, are closely scrutinized for Chief Master Sergeants and only considered if in the best interest of the Air Force and supportive of Chief Master Sergeant development. Subsequently, DEROS adjustments are not routinely approved for Chief Master Sergeants.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.6.3.<b class="calibre1"> Home-Basing Requests. </b>In addition to closely scrutinizing DEROS adjustment requests, the Chiefs Group also uses the same criteria <span class="text_">to</span> review home-basing requests, which are also not routinely approved. The same rationale used in paragraph 15.4.6.2 applies.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.6.4.<b class="calibre1"> Nominative Selection for Strategic-Level Assignments. </b>Specific strategic-level assignments such as Air Force career field managers and command Chief Master Sergeants are filled using a nominative selection process. <span class="text_5">The hiring authority for these positions requests nominations from appropriate organizations, frequently each major command. Each organization then</span> identifies their most qualified Chief Master Sergeants for the advertised position and nominates them to the hiring authority. The hiring authority then selects the best Airman for the job. This highly competitive process ensures a significant level of visibility and senior leader involvement in selecting Chief Master Sergeants to serve in these top positions.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.6.5.<b class="calibre1"> Command Chief Master Sergeant Assignments. </b><span class="text_">Command Chief Master Sergeant</span> assignments are<span class="calibre3">       </span> 2-year minimum and 3-year maximum tours. This ensures an appropriate balance between fresh enlisted leadership and leadership stability within organizations.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.4.7. <b class="calibre1">First-Term Airmen.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">First-Term Airmen serving an initial enlistment of 4 or more years may not be given more than two assignments in different locations following initial basic <span class="text_">and</span> skill training during their first 4 years of service, regardless of tour length. First-Term Airmen who make two permanent change of station moves are permitted an additional permanent change of station in conjunction with an approved humanitarian reassignment or a join spouse assignment, as a volunteer, or when the permanent change of station is a mandatory move. Low-cost moves are excluded from the two-move count.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.4.8.<b class="calibre1"> Availability and Deferment.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Airmen are considered available for reassignment on the first day of the “availability” month. Deferments may be authorized, when possible in most grades and Air Force specialty codes, to maintain an equitable assignment system and also support the need for stability in certain organizations or functions. The reasons for deferments vary. Deferments are normally approved to preclude an Airman’s permanent change of station while suitability to remain on active duty is evaluated or during a period of observation or rehabilitation. Deferments also exist for such things as completion of an educational program or degree, witness for a court-martial, accused in a court-martial, control roster, Article 15 punishment, base of preference program, retraining, humanitarian reasons, etc. AFI 36-2110 contains a complete list of deferments. </p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.8.1. <b class="calibre1">Humanitarian Reassignment, Expedited Transfers and Exceptional Family Member Program Reassignment or Deferment.</b> Policies and procedures concerning humanitarian reassignment, Expedited Transfers and Exceptional Family Member Program reassignment or deferment are outlined in AFI 36-2110. These policies and procedures include but are not limited to:</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.8.1.1. The Humanitarian Program provides reassignment or deferment for Airmen to help them resolve severe short-term problems involving a family member. The problem must be resolvable within a reasonable period of time (normally 12 months); the Airman’s presence must be considered absolutely essential to resolve the problem; and the <span class="text_">Airman</span> must be effectively utilized in his or her control Air Force specialty code at the new assignment. Family members under the humanitarian program are limited to spouse, children, parents, parents-in-law, and those people who have served “in loco parentis.” A person “in loco parentis” refers to one who has exercised parental rights and responsibilities in place of a natural parent for at least 5 years before the Airman’s or spouse’s 21st birthday, or before the Airman’s entry to the Regular Air Force, whichever is earlier. <span class="text_5">While brothers and sisters are not included in the definition of family member for humanitarian consideration, a request involving a brother’s or sister’s terminal illness will be considered as an exception to policy.</span></p>
	<p class="block_6"><span class="text_6">15.4.8.1.2. The</span><span class="text_7"> </span><span class="text_6">Exceptional Family Member Program is a separate and distinct program from humanitarian policy. The Exceptional Family Member Program is based on an Airman’s need for special medical or educational care for a spouse or child that is required long term, possibly permanently. Therefore, this program is not a base-of-choice program, as assignment decisions are based on manning needs of the Air Force at locations where the special medical or educational needs for a spouse or child can be met. The Air Force’s commitment and responsibilities under the Exceptional Family Member Program requires mandatory enrollment and identification of exceptional family members. Under the Exceptional Family Member Program, an Airman may receive a reassignment if a need arises for specialized care that cannot be met where currently assigned. </span><span class="text_8">A deferment from an assignment </span><span class="text_6">may</span><span class="text_8"> </span><span class="text_9">be</span><span class="text_8"> provided for a newly identified condition if the </span><span class="text_6">Airman’s </span><span class="text_8">presence is considered essential.</span><span class="text_6"> The purpose of such a deferment is to allow the Airman time to establish a special medical treatment program or educational program for the exceptional family member. When granted, the initial period of deferment is usually 12 months, after which an Airman may be reconsidered for permanent change of station, if otherwise eligible.</span></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.8.1.3. Expedited Transfers are a separate and distinct program from the humanitarian policy and applies to only Regular Air Force members who are sexually assaulted and file an unrestricted report. The Airman may request an Expedited Transfer with assistance from the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. If an Airman is the victim of stalking or other sexual misconduct (i.e. indecent viewing, visual recording, or broadcasting; forcible pandering; indecent exposure) and files a report, the Airman may also request an expedited transfer with assistance from the Victim and Witness Assistance Program in the installation’s Legal Office. An expedited transfer request initiated on behalf of another will not be accepted. Only exception applies to the vice wing commander applying on behalf of the alleged offender. To enhance protection for the sexual assault victim, potential reassignment of the alleged offender shall be considered by the vice wing commander (or equivalent), balancing interests of the sexual assault victim and the alleged offender. An Airman (victim or alleged offender) will generally only be delayed from departing permanent change of station when they are required to remain for completion of a criminal or disciplinary investigation or action in which they are the subject. All assignment action codes must be removed from the Airman’s personnel file in order to facilitate permanent change of station eligibility. Retraining or cross-flow actions will be considered under this program on a case by case basis as the goal for transferring the Airman is a timely reassignment with minimal disruption to an Airman’s career and family.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.8.2.<b class="calibre1"> Base of Preference (Enlisted Only).</b> The first-term Airmen base of preference program is a reenlistment incentive. The Career Airman base of preference program is an incentive for other Airmen to continue an Air Force career. First-term Airmen in conjunction with reenlistment or retraining may request a permanent change of station from continental United States-to-continental United States or permanent change of station from overseas-to-continental United States. First-term Airmen in the continental United States (only) may request a base of preference to remain in place. A permanent change of station base of preference is not authorized from continental United States-to-overseas or overseas-to-overseas. An in-place base of preference is not authorized for Airmen assigned overseas. Career Airmen may request a base of preference to remain in place at a continental United States <span class="text_4">location or a </span>permanent change of station<span class="text_4"> base of preference for </span>continental United States<span class="text_4">-to-</span>continental United States<span class="text_4"> assignment.</span></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.8.3. <b class="calibre1">Assignment of Military Couples (Join Spouse). </b>Each Airman of a military couple serves in his or her own right. This means military couples must fulfill the obligations inherent to all Airmen. They are considered for assignments to fill valid manning requirements and must perform duties that require the skills in which they are trained. Provided these criteria are met, military couples may be considered for assignments where they can maintain a joint residence. Military couples share the responsibility for reducing family separation. They should not make <span class="text_">decisions</span> on future service, career development, or family planning based on the assumption they will always be assigned to the same location or that join spouse assignment is guaranteed.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.8.4. <b class="calibre1">Voluntary Stabilized Base Assignment Program (Enlisted Only).</b> The Voluntary Stabilized Base Assignment Program provides <span class="text_">Airmen</span> a stabilized tour in exchange for volunteering for an assignment to a historically hard-to-fill location. Application procedures are listed in AFI 36-2110.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.8.5.<b class="calibre1"> Extended Long Overseas Tour Length. </b>The extended long overseas tour volunteer program applies to Airmen who volunteer for permanent change of station overseas to a long-tour location (one where the accompanied tour length is 24 months or more, and the unaccompanied tour length is more than 15 months). Airmen who volunteer for an extended long overseas tour agree to serve the standard tour length plus an additional 12 months. Tour lengths for various overseas locations are listed in the Joint Travel Regulation, Volume 1, Appendix Q. Extended long overseas tour volunteers are considered ahead of standard overseas tour volunteers according to the priorities shown in AFI 36-2110. The 12-month extended tour period is in addition to the normal (accompanied or unaccompanied) long tour length the Airman must serve. A change in status affects the service retainability that must be obtained and the tour length the Airman will be required to serve. The requirement for additional service retainability may require an Airman to extend or reenlist and could affect selective reenlistment bonus calculation.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.8.6.<b class="calibre1"> Educational Deferment.</b> Airmen who have not yet been selected for a permanent change of station may request deferment from assignment selection when <span class="text_">they</span> have nearly completed a vocational program or college degree requirements.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.8.7. <b class="calibre1">High School Senior Assignment Deferment Program.</b> The High School Senior Assignment Deferment Program allows Senior Master Sergeants and below and officers through Lieutenant Colonel to apply for a 1-year assignment deferment. Back-to-back deferments may be possible and military-married-to-military spouses may also apply. As in all situations, however, the needs of the Air Force will come first and will be the determining factor in granting deferments. Requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and deferments will be approved where <span class="text_">possible</span>.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.8.8. <b class="calibre1">Temporary Duty.</b> AFI 36-2110 provides instructions regarding temporary duty procedures. The maximum temporary duty period at any one location in a 12-month period is 180 days unless the Secretary of the Air Force grants a waiver. To the degree possible, Airmen are not selected for involuntary overseas permanent change of station while performing certain kinds of temporary duty. Additionally, if selected for involuntary permanent change of station after one of these temporary duties, the report no later than date will not be within 120 days of the temporary duty completion date.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.8.9.<b class="calibre1"> Dependent Care and Adoption.</b> All Airmen ensure dependent care arrangements are made when they are separated because of temporary duty or permanent change of station. Military couples with dependents and single Airmen sponsors are expected to fulfill their military obligations on the same basis as other Airmen. They are eligible for worldwide duty and all assignments for which they qualify. To ensure all Airmen remain available for worldwide duty, they must have workable plans to provide parent-like care for their dependents as outlined in AFI 36-2908,<i class="calibre2"> Family Care </i><span class="text_10">Plans</span>. Airmen who cannot or will not meet military commitments due to family needs will be considered for discharge. Airmen adopting children are given a limited time to complete the official adoption process and facilitate bonding. Airmen may be authorized deferment during the 6-month period following the date a child is officially placed in the Airmen’s home. Airmen may also be authorized up to 21 days of permissive temporary duty that can be used in conjunction with ordinary leave.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.4.9. <b class="calibre1">Time on Station and Service Retainability.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Minimum time on station requirements exist to provide continuity to an Airman’s member’s unit and, to the degree possible, reasonable periods of stable family life for Airmen. Further, upon selection for permanent change of station, an Airman must have or be able to obtain certain minimum periods of obligated service depending on the type of permanent change of station move. This committed service retainability ensures an Airman has a period of active duty remaining long enough to offset the costs associated with a permanent change of station. Minimum time on station provides continuity to the gaining unit and stability to Airmen <span class="text_">and</span> their families following permanent change of station. Some types of permanent change of station require time on station periods or obligated service periods more or less than the normal limits. Refer to AFI 36-2110 for the time on station and retainability requirements for specific types of permanent change of station.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.9.1. <b class="calibre1">Continental United States-to-Continental United States Permanent Change of Station.</b> For most permanent change of station moves within the Continental United States, first-term Airmen and career Airmen must have at least 48 months of time on station, with the exception of first-term Airmen applying eligible for the first-term Airmen base of preference program. Special circumstances, such as completion of a training course in permanent change of station status, have different time on station minimums. The service retainability <span class="text_">requirement</span> for a Continental United States-to-Continental United States permanent change of station is 24 months regardless of career status.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.9.2.<b class="calibre1"> Continental United States-to-Overseas Permanent Change of Station.</b> First-term Airmen must have at least 12 months of time on station to go from Continental United States to overseas. Career Airmen require<span class="calibre3">                 </span>24 months of time on station before an overseas permanent change of station. When notified of permanent change of station selection, Airmen must have or be eligible to obtain sufficient service retainability to complete the full prescribed overseas tour length elected Airmen who do not have retainability may decline to obtain retainability or, if eligible, may retire instead of accepting a permanent change of station. Declining to obtain retainability for permanent change of station will affect a career Airman by making him or her ineligible for promotion and reenlistment. First-term Airmen become ineligible for most voluntary assignments. Airmen<span class="text_5"> who are eligible and desire that their dependents accompany them at government expense during their overseas tours must serve the “accompanied by dependents” overseas tour length. This tour is normally longer than the unaccompanied tour. Electing to serve the longer accompanied tour requires the </span>Airman<span class="text_5"> to obtain the obligated service retainability for the longer tour. </span>Airmen<span class="text_5"> </span><span class="text_">who</span><span class="text_5"> are either ineligible or decline to obtain the service retainability for the accompanied tour length will not receive approval for dependent travel at the government’s expense or command sponsorship.</span></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.9.3. <b class="calibre1">Overseas-to-Overseas Permanent Change of Station.</b> If an Airman is serving overseas and is a volunteer for a permanent change of station consecutive overseas tour or in-place consecutive overseas tour, the Airman must complete the full-prescribed tour at the current location and the full-prescribed overseas tour at the <span class="text_">new</span> location or another full tour in place.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.9.4.<b class="calibre1"> Overseas-to-Continental United States Reassignment.</b> Reassignment from overseas to continental United States requires the Airman, in most cases, to have or obtain at least 12 months of obligated service retainability. The exceptions are those Airmen serving at a dependent <span class="text_">restricted</span> short tour location of 12 months Airmen who do not have retainability will be retained in the overseas area involuntarily until their date of separation.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.4.10.<b class="calibre1"> Enlisted Quarterly Assignments Listing (EQUAL) and EQUAL-Plus.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">EQUAL provides Airmen a listing of the assignment requirements available for upcoming assignment cycles and allows them the opportunity to align personal preferences to actual Air Force needs. The listing identifies what assignments, by Air Force specialty code and grade, are available at particular locations. The EQUAL-Plus supplements the EQUAL and is used to advertise requirements for special duty assignments, joint and departmental assignments, short-notice oversea assignments, and all Chief Master Sergeant assignments. EQUAL-Plus shows upcoming requirements, any special qualifications an Airman needs to be eligible for selection, the available locations, reporting instructions, and points of contact for additional information. Both lists can be viewed on the Air Force Personnel Services Web page at<span class="text_11"> </span><a href="https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/landing" class="text_12">https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/landing</a><b class="calibre1">.</b></p>
	<p class="block_3">15.4.11.<b class="calibre1"> Assignment Preferences (Enlisted Only).</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Chief Master Sergeants and Chief Master Sergeant-selects volunteer for assignments on EQUAL-Plus by notifying their assignment noncommissioned officer at Headquarters Air Force Senior Leadership Management Office. Notification can be made via telephone, e-mail, datafax, or electronic message. Senior Master Sergeants and below will use the view/change assignment preference update feature in the virtual military personnel flight to record continental United States or overseas assignment preferences. To enhance the chance for selection to a desired location, Airmen should consult the EQUAL and EQUAL-Plus listings. Upon completion of the update, a notice is produced and available for print. (<b class="calibre1">Note: </b>Each Airman is individually responsible for the currency and accuracy of assignment preferences.) <span class="text_5">When a change in status occurs such as marriage, the Airman should update preferences accordingly. Outdated preferences or no preferences on file </span><span class="text_">will</span><span class="text_5"> not be the basis for release of an Airman from an assignment for which selected.</span></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.11.1. <span class="text_11">Home-Basing and Follow-On Assignment Programs.</span><span class="text_4"> The purpose of these programs is to reduce </span>permanent change of station<span class="text_4"> costs, reduce </span>permanent change of station<span class="text_4"> turbulence, and increase stability for Airmen and their families by providing advance </span><span class="text_">assignment</span><span class="text_4"> consideration.

	<p class="block_6">15.4.11.2. <b class="calibre1">Assignment of Family Members.</b> Assignment of family members to the same duty location or unit is not prohibited, however, family members will not be assigned where one family member will or may hold a command or <span class="text_">supervisory</span> position over another family member. Such assignments result in, or may create a perception of, preferential treatment or loss of impartiality, thereby compromising the integrity of command and supervisory functions.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.4.12.<b class="calibre1"> Permanent Change of Station Cancellation by the Air Force:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.12.1. Once an Airman is selected for permanent change of station and orders are published, cancellation of the assignment could impose a hardship on the Airman. Normally, a permanent change of station is not cancelled within 60 days of the projected departure date unless the Airman cannot be effectively used at the projected location. The assignment office of primary responsibility may authorize the cancellation.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.4.12.2. If the Airman indicates a hardship will exist as a result of the cancellation, then the military personnel section will direct the Airman to prepare a written statement containing the details of the hardship. The statement should be coordinated through the unit commander to the military personnel section. Upon receipt, the military personnel section advises the assignment office of primary responsibility, who considers reinstatement of the original assignment, to provide an alternate <span class="text_">assignment</span> or confirms cancellation and provides the reasons why the Airman is required to remain at the present base.</p>
	<p class="block_9">15.4.12.3. AFI 36-2110 contains additional information and also contains guidance in the case where an Airman has departed from his or her previous duty station and is en route to the new location.</p>
	<p class="block_1">Section 15C—Family Care Plans</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.5. Policy.</p>
	<p class="block_3">Department of Defense policy is that the member is responsible for the care of family members during deployments and temporary duty, as at all other times. Failure to produce a family care plan within 60 days of the discussion with the commander, supervisor, or commander’s designated representative may result in disciplinary action and/or administrative separation. In addition to a required family care plan, military members are strongly encouraged to have a will.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.6. Members Who Must Have a Family Care Plan.</p>
	<p class="block_3">Single-member parents with custody of children and bear sole or joint responsibility, and military couples with dependents must have a family care plan. Members who are solely responsible for the care of a spouse, elderly family member, or adult family member with disabilities who is dependent on the member for financial, medical, or logistical support (housing, food, clothing, transportation, etc.) must also have a family care plan. This includes family members who have limited command of the English language, are unable to drive, or gain access to basic life-sustaining facilities. Members whose family circumstances or personal status change must notify their commander as soon as possible but no later than 30 days after any change in circumstance or personal status requires them to establish a family care plan.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.7. Family Care Plans.</p>
	<p class="block_3">These plans must include provisions for short-term absences (such as temporary duty for schooling or training) and long-term absences (such as operational deployments) and designate a caregiver for the affected family members. Financial arrangements may include powers of attorney, allotments, and other documents necessary for logistical movement of the family or caregiver should any of these arrangements become necessary. Additional items may be required to fit individual situations.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.7.1.<b class="calibre1"> Required Counseling:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.7.1.1. <b class="calibre1">New Duty Station.</b> Commanders or first sergeants counsel all Airmen with family members on AFI 36-2908 during inprocessing. During this counseling, commanders and first sergeants must stress the importance of, and confirm the need for, family care certification by completing Air Force IMT 357, <i class="calibre2">Family Care Certification</i>. Commanders or first sergeants may not delegate counseling requirements. <b class="calibre1">Note: </b>For members who are geographically separated from the commander’s location, commanders may delegate, in writing, the authority to counsel members and certify the Air Force IMT 357 to detachment or operating location chiefs.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.7.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Annual Briefing.</b> The commander or first sergeant is required to annually brief, individually, all military members who require an Air Force IMT 357 about their family care responsibilities. During this briefing, the commander or first sergeant signs the Air Force IMT 357 each time the plan is reviewed and certified, determining the actual workability of the family care plan. The member signs and dates the Air Force IMT 357 to document the briefing was completed.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.7.2. <b class="calibre1">Remedial Action.</b></p>
	<p class="block_9">Members who fail to make adequate and acceptable family care arrangements will have disciplinary or other actions taken against them.</p>

	<p class="block_11">Air Force members to included Department of Defense Civilian Expeditionary Workforce members who meet the following criteria will develop and maintain a Family Care Plan: </p>
	<p class="block_11">15.8.1. Single parents who have custody of a child and bear sole or joint responsibility for the care of children under the age of 19 or others unable to care for themselves in the absence of the member.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>
	<p class="block_11">15.8.2. Dual-military couples with dependents. </p>
	<p class="block_11">15.8.3. Married service members with custody or joint custody of a child whose non-custodial biological or adoptive parent is not the current spouse of the Member, or who otherwise bear sole responsibility for the care of children under the age of 19 or for other unable to care for themselves in the absence of the member. <span class="text_13">EXAMPLE</span>: The military member had a child with, or adopted a child with a previous spouse and then they divorced or separated. Then the military member gained full or partial custody of the child. </p>
	<p class="block_11">15.8.4. Members primarily responsible for dependent family members and meet one or more other criteria outlined AFI 36-2908, paragraph 1.2.</p>
	<p class="block_11">15.8.5. Civilian and contractor personnel in emergency essential positions are strongly encouraged to establish family care plans consistent with this instruction. Civilian and contractor personnel should also avail themselves and their caregivers of the information, support, and resources provided by the Airman and Family Readiness Center and social service organizations within legal constraints. </p>
	<p class="block_12"><b class="calibre1">15.9. When to Implement the Family Care Plan. </b>Air Force members will implement their family care plan when required to be absent from their family members.<b class="calibre1"> </b>This includes single parents or military couples assigned to a family-member-restricted area and activation of noncombatant evacuation operations or other emergency evacuation situations if assigned overseas with family members. </p>

	<p class="block_11">15.10.4. Air Force military members, who may be deployed in an area for which imminent danger pay is authorized, may request a deferment of deployment due to unforeseen family circumstances in accordance with DoDI 1342.19.</p>
	<p class="block_1">Section 15D—Reenlistment and Retraining Opportunities</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.11. Selective Reenlistment Program.</p>
	<p class="block_3">The selective reenlistment program applies to all enlisted personnel and the objective is to ensure the Air Force retains only Airmen who consistently demonstrate the capability and willingness to maintain high professional standards.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.11.1.<b class="calibre1"> Selective Reenlistment by Category.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">In the Air Force, reenlistment is a privilege, not a right. The selective reenlistment program provides a process by which commanders/civilian directors and supervisors evaluate all first term, second term, and career Airmen. First-term Airmen receive selective reenlistment program consideration when they are within 15 months of their expiration of term of service. Second term and career Airmen with less than 19 years of total active federal military service are considered within 13 months of the original expiration of term of service. Career Airmen also receive selective reenlistment program consideration when within 13 months of completing 20 years of total active federal military service. Once career Airmen have served beyond 20 years of total active federal military service, they receive selective reenlistment program consideration each time they are within 13 months of their original expiration of term of service.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.11.2.<b class="calibre1"> Responsibilities:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.11.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Unit Commander/Civilian Director.</b> The unit commander/civilian director has total selective reenlistment program selection and nonselection authority for all Airmen and may non-select any Airman for reenlistment at any time outside of their selective reenlistment program window. Reenlistment intent or retirement eligibility has no bearing on the selective reenlistment program consideration process. Unit commanders/civilian directors approve or deny reenlistment and ensure selection or nonselection decisions are consistent with other qualitative decisions (such as promotion) and are based on substantial evidence. Commanders/directors consider enlisted performance report ratings, unfavorable information from any substantiated source, the Airman’s willingness to comply with Air Force standards, and the Airman’s ability (or lack thereof) to meet required training and duty performance levels when determining if a member may reenlist. Commanders/directors may reverse their decisions at any time. Commanders/directors do not use the selective reenlistment program when involuntary separation is more appropriate.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.11.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> Immediate Supervisor. </b>Supervisors provide unit commanders/directors with recommendations concerning the Airman’s career potential. The supervisor’s rater may perform the duties required by the immediate supervisor if the immediate supervisor is on leave or temporary duty. To ensure Airmen meet quality standards, immediate supervisors review the report on individual personnel and the Air Force Form 1137, <i class="calibre2">Unfavorable Information File Summary </i>(if applicable). They then evaluate duty performance and leadership abilities.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.11.3.<b class="calibre1"> Procedures:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.11.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Selection.</b> The military personnel section sends each unit a selective reenlistment program consideration roster that identifies assigned Airmen who require selective reenlistment program consideration. The military personnel section also sends a report on individual personnel for each Airman being considered. The unit forwards the report on individual personnel to supervisors so that each supervisor’s reenlistment recommendation can be documented. The supervisor should carefully evaluate the Airman’s duty performance and review the Airman’s personnel records before making a recommendation to the commander. A supervisor who decides to recommend the Airman for reenlistment places an “X” in the appropriate block, signs the report on individual personnel, and returns the report to the unit commander. The commander reviews the recommendation and evaluates the Airman’s duty performance, future potential, and other pertinent information. The commander selects the Airman for reenlistment by annotating and signing the selective reenlistment program roster. The commander’s signature on the roster constitutes formal selection. The commander sends the selective reenlistment program roster to the military personnel section for processing.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.11.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> Nonselection.</b> If the supervisor decides not to recommend an Airman for reenlistment, he or she initiates an Air Force Form 418, <i class="calibre2">Selective Reenlistment Program Consideration for Airmen in the Regular Air Force/Air Force Reserve</i>, and completes Section I and Section II and forwards to the commander. The commander reviews the recommendation and other pertinent data and decides whether to select the Airman. If the commander does not select the Airman for reenlistment, the commander completes Section III of the Air Force Form 418 and informs the Airman of the decision. During the interview, the commander must make sure the Airman understands the right to appeal the decision. The Airman must make known his or her intention within three workdays of the date the Airman acknowledges the nonselection decision. The Airman must submit the appeal to the military personnel section within 10 calendar days of the date he or she renders the appeal intent on the Air Force Form 418, Section V. The commander sends the Air Force Form 418 to the military personnel section after the Airman signs and initials the appropriate blocks.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.11.4.<b class="calibre1"> Appeals.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Airmen have the right to appeal selective reenlistment program nonselection decisions. The specific appeal authority is based on an Airman’s total active federal military service. First-term Airmen and career Airmen who will complete at least 20 years of total active federal military service on their current expiration of term of service appeal selective reenlistment program nonselection to their respective group commanders. The Airman’s respective wing commander is the selective reenlistment program appeal authority for second term and career Airmen who will complete fewer than 16 years of total active federal military service on their current expiration of term of service. The Secretary of the Air Force is the selective reenlistment program appeal authority for second term and career Airmen who will complete at least 16 years of total active federal military service but fewer than 20 years of total active federal military service on their current expiration of term of service. The decision of the appeal authority is final. The appeal authority’s decision is documented on the Air Force Form 418, and the Airman is advised of the outcome.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.12. Enlistment Extensions.</p>
	<p class="block_3">Any Airman serving on a Regular Air Force enlistment may request an extension if he or she has a service-directed retainability reason and in the best interest of the Air Force. Extensions are granted in whole-month increments. For example, if the individual needs 15 ½ months of retainability for an assignment, the individual must request a 16-month extension. Voluntary extensions for all Airmen are limited to a maximum of 48 months per enlistment. In the event Air Force specialty codes are constrained, Air Staff may limit first-term Airmen extensions to a specified period. Certain situations (such as citizenship pending) may warrant exceptions to policy. Once approved, an extension has the legal effect of the enlistment agreement by extending the period of obligated service. Extensions can only be canceled if the reason for the extension no longer exists, given the Airman has not entered into the extension. For example, if a member was approved for an extension due to an assignment and that assignment was canceled, the member could then cancel the extension within 30 calendar days provided they have not entered into the extension period.</p>
	<p class="block_5"><b class="calibre1">15.13.</b> <b class="calibre1">High Year of Tenure.</b></p>
	<p class="block_3">High year of tenure provides the Air Force with another method of stabilizing the career structure of the enlisted force. High year of tenure essentially represents the maximum number of years Airmen may serve in their current grade AFI 36-3208, <i class="calibre2">Administrative Separation of Airmen</i>, contains waiver provisions for Airmen who believe they have sufficient justification to warrant retention beyond their high year of tenure, but the majority of Airmen are not permitted to reenlist or extend their enlistments if their new date of separation exceeds their high year of tenure. Airmen may be eligible to request an extension of enlistment to establish a date of separation at high year of tenure too separate or retire. Normally, Airmen must be within 2 years of their high year of tenure before they can extend.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.14. Selective Retention Bonus.</p>
	<p class="block_3">The selective retention bonus is a monetary incentive paid to enlisted members to attract reenlistments in, and retraining into, critical military skills with insufficient reenlistments to sustain the career force in those skills. Headquarters United States Air Force adds and deletes skills from the selective retention bonus list as requirements change. The military personnel section is the best source of information on selective retention bonus skills.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.14.1. <b class="calibre1">Zones.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The selective reenlistment bonus is paid in four zones based on total active federal military service:</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.14.1.1. Zone A applies to Airmen reenlisting between 17 months and 6 years.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.14.1.2. Zone B applies to Airmen reenlisting between 6 and 10 years.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.14.1.3. Zone C applies to Airmen reenlisting between 10 and 14 years.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.14.1.4. Zone E applies to Airmen reenlisting between 18 and 20 years.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.14.2. <b class="calibre1">Computing Selective Retention Bonus Awards.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The Air Force calculates the selective retention bonus on the basis of monthly base pay (the rate in effect on the date of discharge [day before reenlistment date] or the day before an extension begins) multiplied by the number of whole years incurred on reenlistment, multiplied by the selective retention bonus multiple for the skill. The selective retention bonus is only payable for obligated service not exceeding 24 years of active service. The maximum selective retention bonus payable to eligible Airmen is $90,000 per zone. Eligible Airmen may receive a selective retention bonus in each zone but only one selective retention bonus per zone (for example, they can receive the last zone A payment and the first zone B payment during the same year). The Air Force, based on current policy directives, may pay up to 100 percent of the bonus amount (less tax) at the time of reenlistment or extension and the remaining percent in equal installments on the anniversary of the reenlistment or extension date.</p>
	<p class="block_5"><b class="calibre1">15.15.</b> <b class="calibre1">Career Job Reservation Program.</b></p>
	<p class="block_3">Because of various career force size and composition restrictions, there are times when the Air Force must place a limit on the number of first-term Airmen who may reenlist. The Career Job Reservation Program exists to assist in the management of first-term Airmen reenlistments, by Air Force specialty code, in order to prevent surpluses and shortages. The Career Job Reservation Program can be active or suspended based on Air Force requirements. When active and in use the program details are as follows:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.15.1.<b class="calibre1"> When to Apply for a Career Job Reservation.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Headquarters United States Air Force meets management requirements by establishing and maintaining a career job requirements file for each Air Force specialty code. Air Force specialty codes career job requirements are distributed over a 12-month period. All eligible first-term Airmen must have an approved Career Job Reservation in order to reenlist. Airmen are automatically placed on the Career Job Reservation waiting list on the 1st duty day of the month during which they complete 35 months on their current enlistment (59 months for 6-year enlistees), but no later than the last duty day of the month during which they complete 43 months on their current enlistment (67 months for 6-year enlistees To keep their approved Career Job Reservation, Airmen must reenlist on or before the Career Job Reservation expiration date.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.15.2. <b class="calibre1">Career Job Reservation Waiting List.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">When the number of Career Job Reservation applicants exceeds the number of available quotas, Air Force Personnel Center must use a rank-order process to determine which Airmen will receive an approved Career Job Reservation. Airmen compete for a Career Job Reservation in their respective initial term of enlistment group (4-year or 6-year enlistee). Applicants are ranked using the following factors: unfavorable information file (automatic disqualifier), top three enlisted performance reports, current grade, projected grade, date of rank, total active federal military service date. Applicants are placed on the Air Force-wide career job applicant waiting list when there are no Career Job Reservations available. An Airman’s position on the waiting list is subject to change as his or her rank order information changes or as new Airmen apply. Airmen may remain on the Career Job Reservation waiting list until their 43rd month on their current enlistment (67 months for 6-year enlistees Supervisors should encourage Airmen to pursue retraining into a shortage skill if a Career Job Reservation is not immediately available.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.15.3. <b class="calibre1">Career Job Reservation in an Additionally Awarded Air Force Specialty Code.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">When Airmen are placed on the Career Job Reservation waiting list in their Air Force specialty code, they may request a Career Job Reservation in an additionally awarded Air Force specialty code if quotas are readily available, the Air Force specialty code is different from their control Air Force specialty code, and they possess at least a 3-skill level in the Air Force specialty code. </p>
	<p class="block_5"><b class="calibre1">15.16.</b> <b class="calibre1">Air Force Retraining Program.</b></p>
	<p class="block_3">Retraining is a force management program used primarily to balance the enlisted career force across all Air Force specialty codes and ensure sustainability of career fields. Retraining also provides a means to return disqualified Airmen to a productive status. Additionally, the program allows a limited number of Airmen the opportunity to pursue other career paths within the Air Force. The Air Force encourages Airmen to voluntarily retrain first, however, the needs of the Air Force may require Airmen to be involuntarily retrained to meet sustainment objectives.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.16.1.<b class="calibre1"> First-Term Airmen Retraining Program.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The first-term Airmen Retraining Program is designed to retrain first-term Airmen in conjunction with a reenlistment, into skills where shortages exist and additionally, allows a limited number of Airmen the opportunity to pursue other career paths in the Air Force. Airmen maybe selected for involuntary retraining based on Air Force needs to balance the force. Airmen may apply not earlier than the 1st duty day of the month during which they complete 35 months of their current enlistment (59 months for 6-year enlistees), but not later than the last duty day of the 43rd month of their current enlistment (67 months for 6-year enlistees). On the last duty day of each month, Air Force Personnel Center runs a retraining board to select the most eligible Airmen. This is not a physical board, but a computer based one. Applications are prioritized on quality indicators; e.g., most recent enlisted performance report (EPR) rating; current grade; projected grade; next two EPR ratings; Date of Rank; Total Active Federal Military Service Date; Aptitude Qualification Examination score in the applicable area (electrical, mechanical, administrative, general or combination in accordance with Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory, Part II, Attachment 4 (Additional Qualifications)); requested Air Force Specialty Code preferences.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.16.2. <b class="calibre1">NCO Retraining Program.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The NCO retraining program is designed to retrain second term and career Airmen from overage Air Force specialties into shortage specialties to optimize the enlisted force to best meet current and future mission needs. Airmen possessing a secondary, or additional Air Force Specialty Code in a shortage skill, may be returned to the shortage skill if in the best interest of the Air Force. This program consists of two phases: Phase I (voluntary) and Phase II (involuntary). Retraining objectives are determined by Air Staff.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.16.3. <b class="calibre1">Online Retraining Advisory.</b></p>
	<p class="block_9">The online retraining advisory is a living document found on MyPers that is maintained by the Air Force Personnel Center. The advisory is readily available and a key tool to advise members of retraining opportunities. AFI 36-2626, <i class="calibre2">Airman Retraining Program</i>, establishes retraining eligibility and application procedures.</p>

	<p class="block_8">15.18. Retirement Benefits.</p>
	<p class="block_3">Enlisted members are eligible to retire if they have 20 years of total active federal military service and there are no restrictions per AFI 36-3203. Enlisted members must apply for retirement. Otherwise, they will separate on their date of separation or expiration of term of service. Officers must have 20 years of total active federal military service and 10 years of total active federal commissioned service to be eligible to retire. A retirement application may be submitted through virtual military personnel flight up to 12 months, but no less than 120 days, before the desired retirement date. Every individual who hopes to retire one day should be familiar with this information. The retirement application is not all-inclusive, and there are exceptions. Every military member should seek personal counseling from the Total Force Contact Center before making firm plans.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.18.1.<b class="calibre1"> Place of Retirement.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">In general, a member may retire in the continental United States. Members assigned to a duty station in the continental United States retire at the duty station. If the member is overseas, the member and family can proceed to the final continental United States home of selection. If the member elects to retire overseas and live permanently in that country, he or she must comply with command and host government residency rules before the date of retirement.</p>

	<p class="block_6">The date initially entered military service normally determines which of the existing <span class="text_">retirement</span> pay plans applies to a member. Date initially entered military service<b class="calibre1"> </b>is the date an individual was initially enlisted, inducted, or appointed in a regular or reserve component of a uniformed service as a commissioned officer, warrant officer, or enlisted member.

Current active military personnel will fall under one of the retirement plans described in Table 15.1.</p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="calibre1">15.19.</b> <b class="calibre1">Survivor Benefit Plan:</b></p>
	<p class="block_3">15.19.1. Military pay stops when a member dies. Established by Congress on 21 September 1972, the survivor benefit plan provides a monthly income to survivors of retired military personnel upon the member’s death. The survivor benefit plan is a government program for retiring members to ensure their eligible survivors receive a portion of their military retired pay in the form of a monthly annuity after their death. The plan was structured so a surviving spouse cannot outlive the annuity, and cost-of-living adjustments are incorporated to offset inflation. Regular Air Force members with a spouse or dependent children are automatically covered by the survivor benefit plan at no cost while they remain on active duty. The member’s death must be classified in line of duty in order for an annuity to be payable if the member is not yet retirement eligible (has not accrued 20 years of active duty) on the date of death. The annuity payable is 55 percent of the retired pay the member would have been entitled to receive if retired with a total disability rating on the date of death. An annuity may also be payable if the member’s death is classified not in line of duty, as long as the member was retirement eligible on the date of death. In this case, annuity payable is 55 percent of the retired pay the member would have been entitled to receive if retired for years of service on the date of death. The surviving spouse of a member who dies in the line of duty while on active duty may request the survivor benefit plan be paid only to the member’s children, avoiding the reduction caused by a spouse’s receipt of dependency and indemnity compensation, the survivor benefits paid by the Department of Veteran Affairs when a member’s death is determined to have resulted from a service-connected cause.</p>

	<p class="block_28">15.19<span class="calibre3">.2. The survivor benefit plan is the only program that enables a portion of military retired pay to be paid to a member’s survivors. Prior to retiring, each member must decide whether to continue survivor benefit plan coverage into retirement. If electing coverage, survivor benefit plan premiums are assessed and automatically deducted from the member’s monthly retired pay. Premiums are government-subsidized and deducted from a participating member’s retired pay before taxes.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_28">15.19.3. Survivor benefit plan premiums and beneficiary annuity payments depend on what is called the “base amount” elected as the basis of coverage. A service member’s base amount can be the full monthly retired pay or a portion of retired pay, down to $300. Full coverage means full-retired pay is elected as the base amount. The base amount is tied to a member’s retired pay; therefore, when retired pay receives cost-of-living adjustments, so does the base amount, and as a result, so do premiums and the annuity payments.</p>
	<p class="block_28">15.19.4. Generally the survivor benefit plan is an irrevocable decision. However, under limited circumstances, you may withdraw from the survivor benefit plan (Figure 15.1) or change your coverage. As a survivor benefit plan participant, you have a 1-year window to terminate survivor benefit plan coverage between the second and third anniversary following the date you begin to receive retired pay. The premiums you paid will not be refunded, and an annuity will not be payable upon your death. Your covered spouse or former spouse must consent to the withdrawal. Termination is permanent, and participation may not be resumed under any circumstance barring future enrollment. The survivor benefit plan also has a “paid-up” feature that permits members who have attained age 70 and who have paid survivor benefit plan premiums for 360 months to stop paying premiums but remain active participants in the plan. Additional information can be attained through the local military personnel section office or the Airman and Family Readiness Center.</p>

As more and more National Guard and Reserve units are called to full-time duty status, counseling has become increasingly important to prepare the civilian-based military members and their families for the period of activation.

	<p class="block_8">15.22. Personal Information File:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.22.1. Commanders and supervisors perform many personnel management functions requiring them to keep files on assigned personnel. AFI 36-2608, <i class="calibre2">Military Personnel Records System,</i> authorizes the use and maintenance of the commander’s or supervisor’s personal information files. Unit commanders or equivalents maintain discretion to create personal information files on all assigned personnel, but personal information files are mandatory for officer personnel who receive a letter of admonishment or a letter of counseling. If a personal information file is established, use of Air Force Form 10A, <i class="calibre2">Personnel Information File, Record of Performance, Officer Command Selection Record Group</i>, is required. Contents are governed by AFI 36-2608. Custodians must keep the personal information files current and secured in a locked area or container to protect against misuse or unauthorized access.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.22.2. According to the Privacy Act of 1974, a person who is the subject of the record may request access to this record at any time. Individuals have the right to review their personal information file at any time and challenge or question the need for documents in the file. The contents are available to commanders, raters, first sergeants, senior raters, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and staff judge advocate personnel as warranted. The release and review of the personal information file contents in these instances are for “official business” or “routine use” according to AFI 33-332, <i class="calibre2">Air Force</i> <i class="calibre2">Privacy and Civil Liberties</i>.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.22.3. Guidance provided according to the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (<a href="https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm" class="text_12">https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm</a>) for retaining and disposing of the personal information file.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.23. The Privacy Act:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.23.1<span class="text_">. The Privacy Act of 1974 as amended </span><span class="text_14">(</span><a href="http://www.justice.gov/opcl/1974privacyact-overview.htm" class="text_12">http://www.justice.gov/opcl/1974privacyact-overview.htm</a><span class="text_14">)</span><span class="text_"> </span>establishes a code of fair information practices that govern the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personal information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. Privacy Act System of Records is defined in the Act as “a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the individual’s name, number, or unique identifier”. Individual is defined in the Act as “a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.” Privacy Act rights are personal to the individual who is the subject of the record and cannot be asserted derivatively by others. Note, however, the parent of any minor, or the legal guardian of an incompetent, may act on behalf of that individual. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of information from a system of records absent the written consent of the subject individual.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.23.2. The Privacy Act limits the collection of information to what the law or Executive Orders authorize. System of Records Notices must be published in the Federal Register allowing the public a 30-day comment period. Such collection must not conflict with the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. A Privacy Act statement must be given when individuals are asked to provide personal information about themselves for collection in a system of records.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.23.3. In addition to specifying disclosure procedures, the Privacy Act governs the maintenance of systems of records. The Act provides individuals with a means by which to seek access to and amend their records and sets forth agency record-keeping requirements. Individuals have the right to request access or amendment to their records in a system. Personally identifiable information in a system of records must be safeguarded to ensure “an official need to know” access of the records and to avoid actions that could result in harm, embarrassment, or unfairness to the individual. The law limits the uses of records to the purposes that are stated in the System of Records Notices, as published in the Federal Register. System of Records Notices for Air Force records systems can be found at <a href="http://dpcld.defense.gov/Privacy/SORNs.aspx" class="text_12">http://dpcld.defense.gov/Privacy/SORNs.aspx</a>. Department of Defense personnel may disclose records to other offices in the Department of Defense when there is “an official need to know” and to other federal government agencies or individuals when a discloser of record is a “routine use” published in the System of Records Notices or as authorized by a Privacy Act exception. In addition, information may be released for a disclosed specified purpose with the subject’s consent. The Office of Primary Responsibility of the data should keep an account of all information they’ve released.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.23.4. For further information, definitions, exemptions, exceptions, or responsibilities and procedures for safeguarding and reporting of personally identifiable information breaches, consult AFI 33-332, <i class="calibre2">Air Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program</i>. The Office of Management and Budget defines a personally identifiable information breach as, “A loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, unauthorized access, or any similar term referring to situations where persons other than authorized users and for an other than authorized purpose have access or potential access to personally identifiable information, whether physical or electronic.”</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.24. Freedom of Information Act.</p>
	<p class="block_3">The Freedom of Information Act provides access to federal agency records (or parts of these records) except those protected from release by nine specific exemptions. Freedom of Information Act requests are written requests that cite or imply the Freedom of Information Act. The law establishes rigid time limits for replying to requesters and permits assessing fees in certain instances. The Freedom of Information Act imposes mandatory time limits of 20 workdays to either deny the request or release the requested records. The law permits an additional 10-workday extension in unusual circumstances specifically outlined in the Freedom of Information Act. (<b class="calibre1">Note:</b> Denials require notification of appeal rights. Requester can file an appeal or litigate.) Refer to Air Force Manual 33-302,<i class="calibre2"> Freedom of Information Act Program</i>, for specific policy and procedures on the Freedom of Information Act and for guidance on disclosing records to the public.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.25. Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.25.1. The Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records is the highest level of administrative review and powerful, yet simple system for correcting military records. Unless procured by fraud, their decision is final and binding on all Air Force officials and government agencies. The Air Force Board for Correction of Military Record’s authority, jurisdiction, and policy are explained in AFI 36-2603, <i class="calibre2">Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records</i>. Air Force Pamphlet 36-2607, <i class="calibre2">Applicants’ Guide to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records</i>, contains additional information.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.25.2. With few exceptions, most records generated by the Air Force may be corrected by the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records; however, an applicant must exhaust other reasonably available administrative avenues of relief prior to applying to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records. For instance, Enlisted Performance Reports may be voided, upgraded, or rewritten; discharges and reenlistment/reentry eligibility codes may be upgraded; survivor benefit plan elections may be changed; leave may be credited; Article 15 actions may be voided; reinstatement into the Air Force may be achieved, etc. Records may be changed, voided, or created as necessary to correct an error or to remove an injustice, and applicable monetary benefits are recomputed based on the records changed. The Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records cannot, however, change the verdict of a courts-martial imposed after 5 May 1950 but may, on the basis of clemency, change the punishment imposed by the final reviewing authority.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.25.3. Because the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records is the highest level of administrative appeal in the Air Force, Applicants must first exhaust other administrative remedies before applying to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records. Otherwise their application (DD Form 149, <i class="calibre2">Application for Correction of Military Record Under the Provisions of Title 10, United States Code, Section 1552</i>) will be returned without action. For example, Enlisted Performance Report appeals must first be submitted through Evaluation Reports Appeal Board, under the provisions of AFI 36-2401, <i class="calibre2">Correcting Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Reports</i>. Applicants should consult AFPAM 36-2607 and or consult with their Force Support Squadron to determine which administrative avenues of relief are available to them depending on the nature of the correction sought.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.25.4. Application to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records is a simple process. However, favorable consideration of the application depends on all the facts and circumstances of the case and how well the request is supported by documentary evidence. The Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records is not an investigative body and except in those rare cases where a personal appearance is granted and testimony is taken, and the decision is based on the evidence contained in the case file. This normally consists of the applicant’s submission (e.g. statements, arguments, documentary evidence, etc.), military record, and advisory opinion(s) from the Air Force office of primary responsibility. There is a presumption of regularity on the part of the government and absent evidence to the contrary is assumed that all government officials exercised their duties in accordance with law and policy. Because of this, the applicant bears the burden of providing sufficient evidence to establish the existence of an error or an injustice in record. The type and extent of evidence necessary to support the case depends on the nature of the request.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.25.5. Cases are reviewed in executive session by a panel of three members, randomly selected from the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records membership. These members, General Schedule-15s and above, the majority of whom are members of the Senior Executive Service cadre, are appointed from the executive part of the department and serve at the discretion of the Secretary. However, service on the board is a collateral, volunteer duty. Applicants may request a personal appearance before the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records; however, a personal appearance is not a statutory right and is granted solely at the discretion of the Board, predicated on the finding the applicant’s presence, without or without counsel, will materially add to the Board’s understanding of the issue(s) involved. Few personal appearances are granted and the decision to conduct such a hearing is made at the time the Board initially adjudicates the application. During deliberations, which are conducted in Executive Session, Board members decide whether the applicant has first exhausted all available avenues of administrative relief; whether the application has been timely filed and if not, whether the failure to do so should be waived in the interest of justice; whether the provisions of Title 10, United States Code, Section 1034 apply to the case, and whether an error or an injustice exists. The Board is a recommending body on all cases and will vote to grant, partially grant, and deny the requested relief. If the board recommends favorable relief, the case is forwarded to the Secretary of the Air Force’s designee for final decision. Applicants have the right to request reconsideration of the Board’s decision; however, reconsideration is granted only if the applicant can provide newly discovered relevant evidence that was not reasonably available when the original application was submitted.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.25.6. Applications formally considered by the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records are processed within 10 to 18 months. Title 10, United States Code, Section 1557, <i class="calibre2">Timeliness Standards for Disposition of Applications Before Corrections Boards,</i> provides oversight and clearance deadlines for the correction of military records review and decision. After fiscal year 2010, 90 percent of the cases must be completed within 10 months.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.26. Air Force Discharge Review Board:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.26.1. The Air Force Discharge Review Board affords former Air Force members the opportunity to request review of their discharge (except for a discharge or dismissal by general court-martial). The objective of a discharge review is to examine an applicant’s administrative discharge and to change the characterization of service, the reason for discharge, and the re-enlistment code (when applicable), based on standards of propriety or equity. Bad conduct discharges, given as a result of a special court-martial, may be upgraded on clemency factors.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.26<span class="calibre3">.2. A personal appearance before the Air Force Discharge Review Board is a statutory right. The applicant or the applicant’s counsel may appear before the board in Washington District of Columbia (Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility Washington, Maryland) or at a regional location. The Board conducts regional boards via video teleconference.  The application can also be considered on a record review basis prior to a request for personal appearance, whereupon the board will review the case based on documentation in the military record and any additional evidence provided by the applicant.</span> The Air Force Discharge Review Board procedures allow the applicant latitude in presenting evidence, witnesses, and testimony in support of the applicant’s case.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.26.3. Airmen separated under circumstances (except retirement) that make them ineligible for reenlistment and officers discharged under adverse conditions are briefed by the Military Personnel Section at the time of their discharge about the Air Force Discharge Review Board process. They are provided with a discharge review fact sheet and an application (DD Form 293, <i class="calibre2">Application for the Review of Discharge from the Armed Forces of the United States</i>).</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.26.3.1. No minimum waiting period is required to submit an application.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.26.3.2. No<span class="text_5"> provisions exist to automatically upgrade a discharge</span>.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.26.3.3. T<span class="text_5">he military will not pay travel expenses to </span>Air Force Discharge Review Board<span class="text_5"> hearing sites.</span></p>
	<p class="block_15">15.26.3.4. The military will not bear the cost of private counsel.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.26.3.4.1. Members may engage counsel at their own expense; however, a number of organizations provide counsel at no cost or a representative to assist applicants. These include national service organizations such as the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, and Veterans of Foreign Wars.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.26.3.5. There is a Department of Defense Electronic Reading Room for the Military Departments Boards for the Corrections of Military/Naval Records and the Discharge Review Boards. The Reading Room contains the decisional documents for each of the Boards from October 1998. The personally identifiable information has been removed (redacted) from these documents. The Reading Room site is: <a href="http://boards.law.af.mil/" class="text_12">http://boards.law.af.mil/</a><span class="text_12">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.26.3.6. Former Members with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder or Traumatic Brain Injury. In the case of a former member of the armed forces who, while serving on active duty as a member of the armed forces, was deployed in support of a contingency operation and who, at any time after such deployment, was diagnosed by a physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist as experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury as a consequence of that deployment, a board established under this section to review the former member's discharge or dismissal shall include a member who is a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist, or a physician with training on mental health issues connected with post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury (as applicable).</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.26.3.7. Former Members with Mental Health Diagnoses. In the case of a former member of the armed forces who was diagnosed while serving in the armed forces as experiencing a mental health disorder, a board established under this section to review the former member’s discharge or dismissal shall include a member who is a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist, or a physician with special training on mental health disorders.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.27. The Virtual Military Personnel Flight.</p>
	<p class="block_4">The Virtual Military Personnel Flight<b class="calibre1"> </b>is a suite of applications that provides the ability to conduct some of the Airmen’s personnel business on line. Examples of applications available now include application for humanitarian reassignment, duty history inquiry, overseas returnee counseling, and reenlistment eligibility inquiry.</p>
	<p class="block_1">Section 15G—Awards and Decorations</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.28. Introduction.</p>
	<p class="block_3">Air Force members make many personal and professional sacrifices to ensure the Air Force accomplishes its mission. Acts of valor, heroism, exceptional service, and outstanding achievement deserve special recognition. The Air Force Awards and Decorations Program, AFI 36-2803, <i class="calibre2">The Air Force Awards and Decorations Program</i>, is limited to recognizing units, organizations, or individuals. This program is designed to foster morale, provide incentive, and esprit de corps. Individuals or units considered for awards and decorations under this program must clearly demonstrate sustained and superior performance. Questions about the Air Force Awards and Decorations Program may be directed to the servicing military personnel section.</p>
	<p class="block_5"><b class="calibre1">15.29.</b> <b class="calibre1">Awards:</b></p>
	<p class="block_3">15.29.1. <b class="calibre1">Service and Campaign Awards.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">These awards recognize members for honorable active military service for participation in a campaign, period of war, national emergency, expedition, or a specified significant peacetime military operation. <span class="text_5">They also recognize individuals who participate in specific or significant military operations and who participate in specific types of service </span>while serving on active duty or as a member of the Reserve forces. Individuals should keep copies of their temporary duty and permanent change of station orders and travel vouchers to help prove entitlement to service and campaign awards. Additional service and campaign awards can be found in AFI 36-2803, <i class="calibre2">The Air Force Awards and Decorations Program or on the Air Force “myPers” website</i>.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.29.1.1. <b class="calibre1">Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.</b> Two of the most common service awards worn by Air Force members today are the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. They were established on 12 March 2003. The Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal is awarded to members who deployed on or after 11 September 2001 for service in Operations <span class="text_17">Enduring Freedom</span>, <span class="text_17">Iraqi Freedom</span>, or <span class="text_17">New Dawn</span>. The Global War on Terrorism Service Medal is awarded to members who participated in the Global War on Terrorism operations outside of the designated area of eligibility for the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal and Iraq Campaign Medal, on or after 11 September 2001 and a date to be determined.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.29.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Afghanistan Campaign Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal.</b> Two other service medals being issued are the Afghanistan Campaign Medal and Iraq Campaign Medal. The Afghanistan Campaign Medal and Iraq Campaign Medal were established on 29 November 2004 and recognize service members who serve or have served in the respective countries in support of Operations <span class="text_17">Enduring Freedom</span>, <span class="text_17">Iraqi Freedom</span>, or <span class="text_17">New Dawn</span>. Effective 1 May 2005, members deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq receive the respective campaign medal in lieu of the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal. Campaign stars are worn on the ribbons to designate official campaign periods as established by the Department of Defense.<span class="text_18"> </span>An Arrowhead Device is authorized to denote participation in a combat parachute jump, helicopter assault landing, combat glider landing, or amphibious assault landing, while assigned or attached as a member of an organized force carrying out an assigned tactical mission.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.29.1.3. <b class="calibre1">Korea Defense Service Medal. </b>In February 2004, Department of Defense approved the Korea Defense Service Medal for Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard personnel as recognition for military service in the Republic of Korea and the surrounding waters after 28 July 1954 and a future date to be determined.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.29.1.4. <b class="calibre1">Humanitarian Service Medal.</b> The Humanitarian Service Medal<b class="calibre1"> </b>is awarded to members of the United States Armed Forces and their Reserve components who, after 1 April 1975, distinguished themselves as individuals or members of United States military units or ships by meritorious direct participation in a significant military act or operation of humanitarian nature. “Direct participation” is any member assigned directly to the humanitarian operation providing hands-on participation. A bronze service star denotes subsequent awards. A listing of approved operations for the Humanitarian Service Medal are identified in DoDM 1348.33, <i class="calibre2">Manual of Military Decorations and Awards</i>.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.29.2. <b class="calibre1">Unit Awards.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6"><span class="text_6">These awards are presented to United States military units that distinguish themselves during peacetime or in action against hostile forces or an armed enemy of the United States. To preserve the integrity of unit awards, they are approved only to recognize acts or services that are clearly and distinctly outstanding by nature and magnitude</span><span class="text_7">. </span><span class="text_6">The acts or services recognized must place the unit’s performance above that of other units similar in composition and mission and be of such importance that they cannot be appropriately recognized in any other way. Only one unit award is awarded for the same achievement or service. The unit’s entire service must have been honorable during the distinguished act. An organization may display the award elements of a unit award. Designated subordinate units of the organization may also share in the award; however, higher organizations may not. All assigned or attached people who served with a unit during a period for which a unit award was awarded are authorized the appropriate ribbon if they directly contributed to the mission and accomplishments of the unit. Questions concerning eligibility to wear a specific unit award may be directed to the local military personnel section. The five most common unit awards worn by Air Force members today are Gallant Unit Citation, the Meritorious Unit Award, the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, the Air Force Organizational Excellence Award, and the Joint Meritorious Unit Award.</span></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.29.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Gallant Unit Citation.</b> The Gallant Unit Citation was approved by the Secretary of the Air Force in March 2004 and is awarded to Air Force units for extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy of the United States while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force on or after 11 September 2001. The unit must have performed with marked distinction under difficult and hazardous conditions in accomplishing its mission so as to set it apart from and above other units participating in the same conflict. The Gallant Unit Citation will normally be earned by units that have participated in single or successive actions covering relatively brief time spans.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.29.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Meritorious Unit Award.</b> The Meritorious Unit Award was also approved by the Secretary of the Air Force in March 2004 and is awarded to Air Force units for exceptionally meritorious conduct in performance of outstanding achievement or service in direct support of combat operations for at least 90 continuous days during the period of military operations against an armed enemy of the United States on or after 11 September 2001. Superior performance of normal mission alone will not justify award of the Meritorious Unit Award. Service in a combat zone is not required, but service must be directly related to the combat effort. The Meritorious Unit Award is not awarded to any unit or unit component previously awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, Air Force Organizational Excellence Award, or unit awards from other Service components for the same act, achievement, or service.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.29.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Air Force Outstanding Unit Award.</b> The Air Force Outstanding Unit Award was established and awarded in the name of the Secretary of the Air Force 6 Jan 1954. The Air Force Outstanding Unit Award is awarded only to numbered units or numbered Air Forces, air divisions, wings, groups, and squadrons. To be awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, an organization must have performed meritorious service or outstanding achievements that clearly set the unit above and apart from similar units. Commanders must annually review the accomplishments of their eligible subordinate units and recommend only those units that are truly exceptional. Only 10 percent of similar units assigned to a command are recommended annually. Commanders send Air Force Outstanding Unit Award recommendations to their major commands for consideration. Certain recommendations for the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award are exempt from annual submission. These are recommendations for specific achievements, combat operations, or conflict with hostile forces.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.29.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Air Force Organizational Excellence Award.</b> The Air Force Organizational Excellence Award was established and awarded in the name of the Secretary of the Air Force 6 Jan 1954.<span class="text_18"> </span>The Air Force Organizational Excellence Award has the same guidelines and approval authority as the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. The Air Force Organizational Excellence Award is awarded to unnumbered organizations such as a major command headquarters, a field operating agency, a direct reporting unit, the Office of the Chief of Staff, and other Air Staff and deputy assistant chief of staff agencies.<span class="text_18"> </span>Only 10 percent of similar units assigned to a command are recommended annually.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.29.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Joint Meritorious Unit Award. </b>The Joint Meritorious Unit Award was established 4 June 1981 and is awarded in the name of the Secretary of Defense to recognize joint units and activities such as a joint task force for meritorious achievement or service superior to that normally expected. Air Force members assigned or attached to the joint unit or joint task force awarded a Joint Meritorious Unit Award may be eligible to wear the Joint Meritorious Unit Award ribbon.</p>
	<p class="block_40"> </p>
	<p class="block_3">15.29.3. <b class="calibre1">Achievement Awards.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">These awards recognize members for achieving or meeting specific types of pre-established criteria or requirements of qualification, service, performance, or conduct. Air Force members must meet specific eligibility requirements and criteria. The Military Personnel Section determines and verifies eligibility for the various types of achievement awards and makes the appropriate entry into personnel records. The military personnel section also procures and provides the initial issue of all achievement medals and ribbons. Additional achievement awards can be found in AFI 36-2803.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.29.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Air Force Longevity Service Award.</b> The Air Force presents the Air Force Longevity Service Award every 4 years to members who complete honorable active Federal military service.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.29.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Air Force Overseas Ribbon. </b>The Air Force awards these ribbons to individuals who have completed an overseas (long or short) tour.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.29.3.3. <b class="calibre1">Air Force Training Ribbon. </b>The Air Force awards this ribbon to members who have completed an Air Force accession training program (since 14 August 1974), such as basic military training, officer training school, Reserve Officer Training Corps, United States Air Force Academy, or Medical Services, Judge Advocate, or Chaplain orientation.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.29.4. <b class="calibre1">Special Trophies and Awards.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The Air Force also sponsors various special trophies and awards programs. Special trophies and awards are unique in that the commanders of major commands, field operating agencies, and direct reporting units must nominate individuals to compete for these awards. In most cases, commanders submit nominations annually. The competition among the nominees is keen. The commander’s nomination alone serves as a meaningful recognition because nomination places the individual in competition with the best in the Air Force or the Nation. Some examples of special trophies and awards are the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year Award and the Lance P. Sijan Award. AFI 36-2805<i class="calibre2">,</i> <i class="calibre2">Special Trophies and Awards</i>, lists various special trophies and awards programs.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.29.5. <b class="calibre1">Foreign Decorations.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The policy of the Department of Defense is that awards from foreign governments may be accepted only in recognition of active combat service or for outstanding or unusually meritorious performance only upon receiving the approval of Department of the Air Force.</p>
	<p class="block_5"><b class="calibre1">15.30.</b> <b class="calibre1">Decorations:</b></p>
	<p class="block_3">15.30.1. <b class="calibre1">What Is a Decoration?</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Formal recognition for personal excellence that requires individual nomination and Air Force or Department of Defense approval. Decorations are awarded in recognition for acts of valor, heroism, courage, exceptional service, meritorious service, or outstanding achievement that clearly place members above their peers and be of such importance that the person cannot receive proper recognition in any other way. When an individual is being considered for a decoration, the determining factors are level of responsibility, achievements, accomplishments, manner of performance, and the impact of the accomplishment. Each decoration has specific performance requirements for award, and an individual may receive only one decoration for any act, achievement, or period of service. Specific criteria for each decoration are in AFI 36-2803.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.30.2. <b class="calibre1">Recommending an Individual for a Decoration.</b></p>
	<p class="block_9">Any person, other than the individual being recommended, having firsthand knowledge of the act, achievement, or service may recommend or contribute to a decoration recommendation by providing evidence or statements through the supervisor and chain of command of the member being recommended. However, this obligation primarily falls on the immediate supervisor. The three most common decorations are the Air Force Achievement Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal, and the Meritorious Service Medal. Every unit, wing, and major command has specific submission criteria and procedures for these three decorations. For specific guidance, contact your commander support staff or the force management section at the local force support squadron or military personnel section.</p>
	<p class="block_1">Section 15H—Airman Promotion System</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.31. Objective.</p>
	<p class="block_3">The enlisted promotion system supports Department of Defense directive 1304.20, <i class="calibre2">Enlisted Personnel Management System (EPMS),</i> by helping to provide a visible, relatively stable career progression opportunity over the long term; attracting, retaining, and motivating to career service, the kinds and numbers of people the military services need; and ensuring a reasonably uniform application of the principle of equal pay for equal work among the military services. This section addresses the program elements of the Regular Air Force Airman.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.32. Promotion Quotas.</p>
	<p class="block_3">Promotion quotas for the top five grades (Staff Sergeant through Chief Master Sergeant) are tied to fiscal-end strength and are affected by funding limits, regulatory limits, and the number of projected vacancies in specific grades. The Department of Defense limits the number of Airmen the Air Force may have in the top five grades. Public law (Title 10, United States Code, Section 517) limits the number of Airmen who may serve in the Regular Air Force in the top two enlisted grades. The authorized daily average of enlisted members on active duty (other than for training) in pay grades E-8 and E-9 in a fiscal year may not be more than 2.5 percent and 1.25, respectively.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.33. Promotion Cycles and General Eligibility Requirements.</p>
	<p class="block_3">The Air Force establishes promotion cycles to ensure timely periodic promotions and to permit more accurate forecasting of vacancies. Promotion cycles also balance the promotion administrative workload and provide cutoff dates for eligibility. The basis for promotion eligibility is proper skill level, sufficient time in grade, sufficient time in service, and a recommendation by the immediate commander. Table 15.2 lists time in service, time in grade, and significant dates of promotion. Table 15.3 lists minimum eligibility requirements for each grade.</p>

	<p class="block_8">15.39. Promotion by Grade:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.39.1.<b class="calibre1"> Airman and Airman First Class.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The Air Force normally promotes eligible Airmen recommended by their commander on a noncompetitive basis. An Airman Basic must have 6 months of time in grade to be eligible for promotion to Airman. The time in grade requirement for an Airman to be eligible for promotion to Airman First Class is 10 months. There are different phase points for individuals graduating from basic military training as Airman or Airman First Class that correspond with their earlier promotions. Individuals initially enlisting for a period of 6 years are promoted from Airman Basic or Airman to Airman First Class upon completion of either technical training, or 20 weeks of technical training (start date of the 20-week period is the date of basic military training completion), whichever occurs first. </p>
	<p class="block_3">15.39.2.<b class="calibre1"> Senior Airman.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The Air Force promotes Airman First Class to Senior Airman with either 36 months of time in service and 20 months of time in grade or 28 months of time in grade, whichever occurs first. They must possess a 3-skill level and be recommended by their unit commander. Airman First Class may compete for early advancement to Senior Airman if they meet the minimum eligibility criteria outlined in the aforementioned Table 15.3. If promoted to Senior Airman below the zone, their promotion effective date would be 6 months before their fully qualified date. Individuals are considered in the month (December, March, June, or September) before the quarter (January through March, April through June, July through September, or October through December) they are eligible for below the zone promotion.</p>
	<p class="block_28">15.39.3.<b class="calibre1"> Staff Sergeant and Technical Sergeant.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Promotion to the grades of Staff Sergeant through Technical Sergeant occurs under one of two programs: the Weighted Airman Promotion System or Stripes for Exceptional Performers.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.39.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Weighted Airman Promotion System.</b> Airmen compete and test under Weighted Airman Promotion System in their control Air Force specialty code held on the promotion eligibility cutoff date. The Weighted Airman Promotion System consists of up to four weighted factors: specialty knowledge test, promotion fitness examination, decorations, and enlisted performance reports. Each of these factors is “weighted” or assigned points based on its importance relative to promotion. The promotion fitness examination and specialty knowledge test account for 200 points. The promotion fitness examination contains a wide range of Air Force knowledge, while the specialty knowledge test covers Air Force specialty code broad technical knowledge. Table 15.4 shows how to calculate points. The Air Force makes promotions under Weighted Airman Promotion System within each Air Force specialty code, not across them. This means those eligible compete for promotion only with those individuals currently working in their Air Force specialty code. Selectees are individuals with the highest scores in each Air Force specialty code, within the quota limitations. If more than one individual has the same total score at the cutoff point, the Air Force promotes everyone with that score.</p>
	<p class="block_47">15.39.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> Stripes for Exceptional Performers Program.</b> The Stripes for Exceptional Performers Program, established in 1980, is designed to meet those unique circumstances that, in the commander’s judgment, clearly warrant promotion. Under Stripes for Exceptional Performers, commanders of major commands and field operating agencies and senior officers in organizations with large enlisted populations may promote a limited number of Airmen with exceptional potential to the grades of Staff Sergeant through Technical Sergeant (each major command determines their own procedures and Stripes for Exceptional Performers selection levels). The commander must ensure personnel who are promoted meet eligibility requirements including completion of the appropriate enlisted professional military education. An individual may not receive more than one promotion under any combination of promotion programs within a 12-month period. (<b class="calibre1">Exception:</b> A Senior Airman must serve 6 months of time in grade before being promoted to Staff Sergeant.) Isolated acts or specific achievements should not be the sole basis for promotion under this program.

	<p class="block_6">Consideration for promotion to the grades of Master Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant is done through a two-phased process. Phase I is similar to the Weighted Airman Promotion System evaluation for Staff Sergeant and Technical Sergeant, although some promotion factors differ. Phase II consists of a central evaluation board held at Air Force Personnel Center using the whole-person concept. All promotion eligibles for each cycle are reviewed by the central evaluation board. The Air Force selects senior NCOs with the highest scores in each Air Force specialty code for promotion, within the quota limitations. If more than one senior NCO has the same total score at the cutoff point, the Air Force promotes everyone with that score. Table 15.5 (Master Sergeant cycle) and Table 15.6 (Senior Master Sergeant/Chief Master Sergeant cycles) detail how points are calculated.</p>
	<p class="block_32">15.40. Weighted Airman Promotion System Testing:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.40.1.<b class="calibre1"> General Responsibilities and Score Notices.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Preparing for promotion testing is solely an individual responsibility. Weighted Airman Promotion System score notices are a means to give Airmen a report of their relative standing in the promotion consideration process and should never be provided to or used by anyone other than the individual and his or her commander. An Airman’s scores cannot be disclosed without the Airman’s written consent. Commanders support staff, first sergeants, supervisors, etc., are not authorized access to an Airman’s Weighted Airman Promotion System scores. The commander has the specific duty to notify Airmen of promotion selection or nonselection results and may need to review their score notices to determine status. Commanders must restrict their use of the scores to notification and advisory counseling on behalf of the Airman and must not allow further dissemination of scores. Individuals may retrieve a copy of their score notice on the virtual military personnel flight after the initial promotion selection for the current cycle.</p>
	<p class="block_28">15.40.2.<b class="calibre1"> Individual Responsibilities.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Personal involvement is critical. As a minimum, all Airmen testing must:</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.40.2.1. Know their promotion eligibility status.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.40.2.2. Maintain their specialty and military qualifications to retain their eligibility.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.40.2.3. Use a self-initiated program of individual study and effort to advance their career under Weighted Airman Promotion System.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.40.2.4. Obtain all current study references for a particular promotion cycle.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.40.2.5. Review the annual Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog to check availability and receipt of correct study references.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.40.2.6. Be prepared to test the first day of the testing window and throughout the testing cycle. Members who will be unavailable during the entire testing cycle due to a scheduled temporary duty must be prepared to test prior to temporary duty departure even if the temporary duty departure is before the first day of the testing cycle. Airman may opt to test early provided the correct test booklets are available.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.40.2.7. Ensure they receive at least 60 days of access to study materials prior to testing.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.40.2.8. (For Master Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant eligibles) Ensure their selection folder at Air Force Personnel Center is accurate and complete.</p>

	<p class="block_6">Published annually on 1 October, the <i class="calibre2">Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog</i> lists all enlisted promotion tests authorized for administration and the study references associated with these tests. Only publications used to support questions on a given promotion test are listed. There are three types of tests discussed in the catalog; Promotion Fitness Examinations, United States Air Force Supervisory Examinations, and specialty knowledge tests. The study references for the Promotion Fitness Examinations and United States Air Force Supervisory Examinations are the grade-specific study guides derived from AFH 1, <i class="calibre2">Airman</i> and the study references for specialty knowledge tests are a combination of career development courses and/or technical references. Career development courses used as study references may be different from those issued for upgrade training. The catalog also contains administrative and special instructions for test control officers. The <i class="calibre2">Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog</i> is available at <a href="https://www.omsq.af.mil/" class="text_12">https://www.omsq.af.mil/</a>.</p>

According to AFI 36-2605, <i class="calibre2">Air Force Military Personnel Testing System</i>, promotion eligible Airmen should have access to their reference materials at least 60 days before the scheduled test date. If not, the Airman may request a delay in testing.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.42. Promotion Test Development:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.42.1.<b class="calibre1"> Test Developers.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The Airman Advancement Division, Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas, produces all Air Force enlisted promotion tests, which are written by Airmen for Airmen. Although the tests are developed at Airman Advancement Division, senior NCOs from across the Air Force travel to Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph to develop and validate the test questions. For specialty knowledge tests, senior NCO subject-matter experts are selected based on their specialties and job experience. For Promotion Fitness and United States Air Force Supervisory Examinations, Chief Master Sergeants are selected based on Air Force demographics, extensive experience, and major command representation. Test development specialists provide psychometric and developmental expertise required to ensure the tests are credible, valid, and fair to all examinees. All enlisted promotion tests are revised annually.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.42.2.<b class="calibre1"> Test Development Process.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Airman Advancement Division test development specialist’s work closely with Air Force career field managers to stay abreast of changes affecting career fields which may impact promotion test development. At the beginning of a test development project, the most current tests are administered to the subject-matter experts. This gives subject-matter experts the point of view of the test takers and helps them evaluate how the test content relates to performance in their specialties. They carefully check the references of each question. Only after this is accomplished do they begin developing new test questions. Every question on a test comes from one of the publications listed in the <i class="calibre2">Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog</i>. </p>
	<p class="block_3">15.42.3.<b class="calibre1"> Specialty Knowledge Tests.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Specialty knowledge tests measure important job knowledge required of Staff Sergeants, Technical Sergeants, and Master Sergeants in a particular specialty. Senior NCOs from each career field, guided by test development specialists, develop tests for their Air Force specialty using the specific career field education and training plan, occupational analysis data, and their experiences to tie test content to important tasks performed in the specialty.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.42.4.<b class="calibre1"> Promotion Fitness Examination and United States Air Force Supervisory Examination.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The Promotion Fitness Examination measures military and supervisory knowledge required of Staff Sergeants, Technical Sergeants, and Master Sergeants. The United States Air Force Supervisory Examination evaluates practical military, supervisory, and managerial knowledge required for the top two non-commissioned grades. Chief Master Sergeants from across the Air Force, guided by test development specialists, develop these tests using the Military Knowledge and Testing System chart and their experience.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.43. Promotion Test Administration and Scoring.</p>
	<p class="block_3">Promotion tests are administered to all Airmen competing for promotion to the grades of Staff Sergeant through Chief Master Sergeant. To the greatest extent possible, test administration procedures are standardized to ensure fairness for all members competing for promotion. Strict procedures are used for handling, storing, and transmitting test booklets and answer sheets to preclude the possibility of loss or compromise. All promotion tests are electronically scored at Air Force Personnel Center following thorough quality control steps to ensure accurate test results for each member. The test scanning and scoring process contains many safeguards to verify accuracy, including hand-scoring a percentage of answer sheets (pulled randomly), and physically reviewing answer sheets. Because of the difficulty of the tests, some individuals may receive scores they believe do not reflect their study efforts. Likewise, some members may receive the same score as the previous year. Information concerning verification of test scores is contained in AFI 36-2605.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.44. Air Force Enlisted Promotion Test Compromise.</p>
	<p class="block_3">Group study (two or more people) is strictly prohibited. This prohibition protects the integrity of the promotion testing program by ensuring promotion test scores are a reflection of each member’s individual knowledge. Enlisted personnel who violate these prohibitions are subject to prosecution under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for violating a lawful general regulation. Conviction can result in a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for up to 2 years. Information concerning enlisted promotion test compromise is contained in AFI 36-2605. In addition to group study, specific test compromise situations include, but are not limited to:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.44.1. Discussing the contents of a specialty knowledge test, promotion fitness examination, or United States Air Force supervisory examination with anyone other than the test control officer or test examiner. Written inquiries or complaints about a test are processed through the test control officer.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.44.2. Sharing pretests or lists of test questions recalled from a current or previous specialty knowledge test, promotion fitness examination, or United States Air Force supervisory examination; personal study materials; underlined or highlighted study reference material; and commercial study guides with other individuals.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.44.3. Although the Air Force does not recommend or support commercial study guides, they may be used to prepare for promotion testing. Placing commercial study guide software on government computers is prohibited because doing so implies Air Force sanctioning of the guides. Additionally, there are prohibitions against developing commercial study guides. </p>
	<p class="block_3">15.44.4. Creating, storing, or transferring personal study notes on government computers. Government computers may be used to view electronic versions of official study references such as this pamphlet, Air Force instructions, Air Force policy directives, technical orders, etc.</p>
	<p class="block_3"><b class="calibre1">Note:</b> Training designed to improve general military knowledge, such as NCO of the quarter or Senior Airman below the zone boards, does not constitute group study as long as the intent of the training is not to study for promotion tests. Likewise, training to improve general study habits or test-taking skills is permissible if the training does not focus on preparing for promotion tests. However, individuals may not collaborate in any way or at any time to prepare for promotion testing.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.45. Supplemental Promotion Actions.</p>
	<p class="block_3">Air Force Personnel Center conducts in-system promotion consideration on a monthly basis. Supplemental evaluation boards for promotion to the grades of Master Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant, and Chief Master Sergeant are conducted on a semiannual basis. Remember, supplemental promotion consideration may not be granted if the error or omission appeared on the data verification record, or in the senior NCO selection record, located in the personnel records display application, and the individual did not take the necessary steps to correct the error prior to promotion selection or prior to the evaluation board. Fully documented supplemental consideration requests, to include proof of corrective or follow-up actions taken by the individual to correct the error, are submitted to the military personnel section, in writing, with the recommendation of the individual’s unit commander. The military personnel section forwards the request to Air Force Personnel Center for final approval.</p>
	<p class="block_54">15.46. Occupational Analysis Program.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.46.1. The Air Education and Training Command, Occupational Analysis Division houses the Air Force Occupational Analysis Program, governed by AFI 36-2623, <i class="calibre2">Occupational Analysis</i>. The purpose of the Occupational Analysis Program is to equip senior leaders and managers of Air Force personnel and training programs with objective, fact-based information about Air Force occupations and civilian occupational series. The role of occupational analysis is to conduct occupational studies; develop survey instruments, analyze the data collected, and provide actionable Air Force specialty information. Decision makers associated with training program responsibilities for an Air Force specialty use occupational survey data to establish, validate, and adjust training. Decision makers associated with personnel programs for an Air Force specialty use occupational survey data to justify or change personnel policies and to refine, or maintain occupational structures. Occupational survey data is provided to the Air Education and Training Command, Airman Advancement Division to ensure enlisted promotion tests are relevant, fair, and reliable.<span class="calibre3">  </span></p>
	<p class="block_3"><span class="text_20">15.46.2. </span>As noted in AFPD 36-26, <i class="calibre2">Total Force Development</i>, paragraph 1.1.6., the Department of the Air Force adopted the Instructional System Development process to develop Air Force training programs. The Occupational Analysis Program is the <span class="text_13">singularly unique Air Force entity</span> which collects, analyzes, and reports the job/occupational performance factors which are defined, measured, and applied within Instructional System Development. <span class="text_20">The </span>Occupational Analysis Program is integral to providing an objective and factual orientation for three force development tenets inherent to AFPD 36-26, <i class="calibre2">Total Force Development</i>: (1) capabilities-based training (used to identify knowledge needed and specific tasks necessitating training to meet job performance requirements); (2) personnel classification and utilization (used to identify tasks performed at each career stage and to validate occupational structures); and (3) promotion testing (used to identify operationally relevant duties and tasks for test development to promote and retain the best Airmen).

	<p class="block_7"> </p>
	<p class="block_3">15.46.3. The Occupational Analysis Division conducts occupational studies on enlisted Air Force specialties on a periodic basis, typically a 3- to 4-year cycle, and upon request (if out of cycle). Special studies, to include officer Air Force specialties and civilian occupational series, are conducted upon request. Career field leaders and subject matter experts are key to the process in developing the content of the survey instruments. Occupational surveys are administered to all eligible personnel in the targeted Air Force specialty or civilian occupational series through direct email (AFNet).</p>

Occupational analysis reports data includes information on the duties and responsibilities performed by career field members in the form of task statements and duty areas. Collectively, this data describe the work performed by career field members in their jobs (Air Force Specialty Code) and throughout each stage of their career. Additionally, </span>occupational survey data<span class="text_20"> provides supporting information on when and how members should be trained to perform their jobs. Enlisted career field training personnel use </span>occupational survey data<span class="text_20"> (e.g., skill-level member data) as the primary source of empirical data to support decisions on </span><span class="text_21">what</span><span class="text_20"> type of training is needed, </span><span class="text_21">who</span><span class="text_20"> needs the training, and to what </span><span class="text_21">depth</span><span class="text_20"> the training should be taught...</span><span class="text_21">Right Skills * Right Time * Right Place</span><span class="text_20">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_6"><span class="text_20">15.46.3.1.2. Career field leaders at specialty training requirements team sessions and/or utilization and training workshops are primary users of </span>occupational survey data<span class="text_20">. These conferences of career field leaders, and training and personnel specialists evaluate existing training requirements for relevancy and efficacy. Based on </span>occupational survey data<span class="text_20">, conference attendees make changes to career field education and training plans, career development course content, and the Air Force Specialty/Air Force Specialty Code description of duties, responsibilities, and qualifications as depicted in their respective Air Force Classification Directory (Enlisted. officer, or civilian Office of Personnel Management Handbook).</span></p>
	<p class="block_6"><span class="text_20">15.46.3.1.3. </span>Occupational survey data is also crucial in the development and validation of specialty knowledge test content—integral to the Weighted Airman Promotion System. Occupational survey data are the objective source of job information available to specialty knowledge test development teams to construct promotion examinations that meet the requirements for relevance, fairness, and reliability. The Occupational Analysis Program produces a collective measure of occupational survey data which identifies mission essential tasks (areas of work) that suggests this data should serve as the basis for relevant promotion test content.</p>
	<p class="block_6"><span class="text_20">15.46.3.1.4. The </span>Occupational Analysis<span class="text_20"> process and data application are conducted IAW AFI 36-2623, </span><span class="text_21">Occupational Analysis</span><span class="text_20"> and supported by AFPD 36-26, </span><span class="text_21">Total Force Development</span><span class="text_20">, AFMAN 36-2234, </span><span class="text_21">Instructional System Development (ISD)</span><span class="text_20">, and AFH 36-2235, Vol 9, </span><span class="text_21">ISD Application to Technical Training</span><span class="text_20">.

	<p class="block_3">15.46.4. All career field members have pivotal roles with the constructive outcomes of occupational studies. Airmen of a career field being surveyed must devote the necessary time and commitment in completing their assigned occupational surveys. As stated previously, the data collected from each Airman, each survey participant, translates into operationally relevant training programs for their Air Force Specialty Code, and fair and reliable promotion tests for their career field under Weighted Airman Promotion System.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.46.5. View your career field information by visiting the Air Force Occupational Analysis Program website: <a href="http://oa.aetc.af.mil/" class="text_12">oa.aetc.af.mil/</a>,<span class="text_16"> </span>select enlisted products, and find your Air Force Specialty’s <span class="text_20">occupational analysis reports</span> to gain valuable insights into the duties and responsibilities of your career field, and other career fields across the Air Force. In addition to the duties and tasks performed, and equipment and systems operated within a career field, you can also view job satisfaction information, work-life balance data, and the rationale behind <i class="calibre2">why</i> Airmen are reenlisting or separating from the Air Force. This information brings great value should you be considering career broadening through retraining.</p>

	<p class="block_8">15.47. Individual Responsibility:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.47.1. The importance of individual responsibility cannot be overemphasized. Each individual is responsible for ensuring he or she is properly identified as eligible for promotion consideration. (See AFI 36-2502, for minimum eligibility requirements for promotion.) Those eligible should have the current study reference materials, know when the testing cycle starts, ensure the information in their selection folder at Air Force Personnel Center is accurate and complete, study as needed, and test when scheduled.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.47.2. Those eligible for promotion to Master Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant should obtain their data verification record (Figure 15.4) through virtual military personnel flight. The data verification record displays current career information as of the promotion eligibility cutoff date, some of which is included in the senior NCO evaluation brief (Figure 15.5) reviewed by the evaluation board.</p>
	<p class="block_28">15.47.3. Along with reviewing the data verification record, eligibles should review their senior NCO selection folder documents filed in automated records management system and personnel records display application to ensure data is accurate and appropriate documents are filed. Promotion eligibles should notify their military personnel section of any errors.</p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="calibre1">15.48.</b> <b class="calibre1">Promotion Criteria:</b></p>
	<p class="block_3">15.48.1. As noted in the aforementioned Tables 15.5 (MSgt), 15.6 (SMSgt/CMSgt) show how to calculate weighted factors for promotions and Table 15.3 shows the minimum eligibility requirements for promotion to Senior Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.48.2. Senior Master Sergeants being considered for promotion to Chief Master Sergeant will compete for promotion in the chief enlisted manager code of the control Air Force specialty code they held as of the promotion eligibility cutoff date. Master Sergeants being considered for promotion to Senior Master Sergeant will compete for promotion in the superintendent level of the control Air Force specialty code they held as of the promotion eligibility cutoff date. Individuals with a reporting identifier or special duty identifier, designated as their control Air Force specialty code on the promotion eligibility cutoff date, will compete within that reporting identifier or special duty identifier.</p>

	<p class="block_3">15.48.3. The board considers academic education completed on or before the promotion eligibility cutoff date. Up to three academic education levels can be reflected on the senior NCO evaluation brief. When the academic education level is updated in the personnel data system, the promotion file is updated and a new data verification record and evaluation brief is produced to reflect the change. If the Community College of the Air Force degree was awarded by Community College of the Air Force or any other accredited college requirements were completed before the promotion eligibility cutoff date but the evaluation brief was completed within 10 days of the board convening date, the education services office will update the personnel data system. The individual must notify the Air Force Personnel Center by message of this update. This information is then used to post the senior NCO evaluation brief filed in the senior NCO selection folder. Promotion eligible Airmen are responsible for ensuring this data is posted on their data verification record and evaluation brief.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.48.4. The promotion eligibility cutoff date is used to determine content of the selection folder and information on promotion evaluation briefs. The number of enlisted performance reports included is limited to those reports closed out 5 years before the promotion eligibility cutoff date (maximum of 10 enlisted performance reports). Approved decorations, resubmissions, or decorations being upgraded must be submitted and placed into official channels before the selection date. The data shown on the senior NCO evaluation brief includes the member’s name, social security number, grade, date of rank, Air Force specialty information, service dates (to include projected retirement date), academic education level, decorations, duty information, duty history, and professional military education/Community College of the Air Force completion.</p>
	<p class="block_5"><b class="calibre1">15.49.</b> <b class="calibre1">Evaluation Board.</b></p>
	<p class="block_3">The evaluation board is very important because the evaluation board accounts for over half the total score. Understanding how board members are selected, the evaluation board process, and those areas considered by board members can provide valuable insight into what is required to get promoted.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.49.1.<b class="calibre1"> Selection of Board Members.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The number of promotion eligible personnel identified by major command and Air Force specialty codes determines the number and career field backgrounds of the board members. Board members are divided into panels, each consisting of one colonel and two Chief Master Sergeants. The board president is always a general officer. Before evaluating records, board members are briefed on the task objective, eligible population profile, and selection folder content. Board members are then sworn to complete the board’s task without prejudice or partiality. They also participate in an extensive trial-run process to ensure scoring consistency before evaluating any “live” records.</p>
	<p class="block_28">15.49.2.<b class="calibre1"> Areas the Board Considers.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The board looks at performance, education, breadth of experience, job responsibility, professional competence, specific achievements, and leadership. In each area, the individual has control over the information the board reviews. Individuals therefore—not board members—are responsible for their own promotions by ensuring the board receives the most current updates.</p>
	<p class="block_47">15.49.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Performance.</b> The evaluation board reviews all enlisted performance reports for the 5 years preceding the promotion eligibility cutoff date. The board members consider all aspects of the enlisted performance report—job description (key duties, tasks, and responsibilities), individual rating factors, periods of supervision, overall evaluations, levels of endorsements, and each narrative word picture. If the person is an exceptional performer, the enlisted performance reports should convey to the board that he or she has demonstrated the highest qualities required of a leader and manager.</p>
	<p class="block_47">15.49.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> Education.</b> When considering educational opportunities, enlisted members should focus on a degree program that complements their career field and enhances their ability to do their job. When the board evaluates academic education as part of the whole-person assessment, the most important consideration should be the degree to which the education enhances the member’s potential to serve in the next higher grade.</p>
	<p class="block_47">15.49.2.3.<b class="calibre1"> Breadth of Experience.</b> This factor refers to the individual’s overall professional background, experience, and knowledge gained during his or her career to the present. Board members consider knowledge and practical experience in areas other than the current Air Force specialty code. If the eligible individual remained in one career field, board members consider whether he or she had wide exposure across the career field. Board members also consider potential to fill other types of jobs, as well as supervisory and managerial experience.</p>
	<p class="block_47">15.49.2.4.<b class="calibre1"> Job Responsibility.</b> This factor does not refer entirely to the career field’s command-level positions, although experience at this level is a consideration. Many base-level jobs demand just as much of an individual as jobs at higher command levels. Consideration is primarily given to what was asked of the individual and how well the individual accomplished the task. Did the job require significant decisions, or was it a job in which the individual routinely carried out the decisions of others? Is the individual a proven, effective leader, responsible for directing the work of others, or is the person responsible only for his or her own performance?</p>
	<p class="block_47">15.49.2.5.<b class="calibre1"> Professional Competence.</b> What do rating and endorsing officials say about the individual’s expertise? Is it truly outstanding? How much does the individual know about the job, and how well does he or she accomplish it? The Air Force Chief of Staff has emphasized the need for careful selection of individuals for promotion to the senior NCO grades. Therefore, those selected must be the best qualified. They must have sufficient leadership and managerial experience to prepare them for the challenges they, and the Air Force, face.</p>
	<p class="block_47">15.49.2.6.<b class="calibre1"> Specific Achievements.</b> These are often recognized in the form of awards and decorations. However, many other significant accomplishments are often addressed in the enlisted performance report’s narrative comments. Such recognition, either in the form of decorations or narrative comments, can help board members identify truly outstanding performers.</p>
	<p class="block_47">15.49.2.7.<b class="calibre1"> Leadership.</b> Board members use their judgment, expertise, and maturity when reviewing records to assess a member’s potential to serve in a higher grade. In particular, board members evaluate leadership potential. How well does he or she manage, lead, and interact with peers and subordinates? What have rating officials said about the person’s leadership qualities and potential? What haven’t they said?</p>
	<p class="block_5"><b class="calibre1">15.50.</b> <b class="calibre1">Evaluation Process:</b></p>
	<p class="block_3">15.50.1.<b class="calibre1"> Trial Run.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">As previously mentioned, board members are given two selected sets of records to score as a practice exercise before the actual scoring process. Using the whole-person concept, they score the records using secret ballots. This process helps establish a scoring standard they can apply consistently throughout the board process.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.50.2.<b class="calibre1"> Scoring:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.50.2.1. After the trial run is completed and discussed, panels begin the actual scoring of live records. The same panel evaluates all eligibles competing in a chief enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code. Each panel member scores each record, using a 6- to 10-point scale and half-point increments. An individual’s record may receive a panel composite score (3 members) from a minimum of 18 (6-6-6) to a maximum of 30 (10-10-10) points. The composite score (18 to 30 points) is later multiplied by a factor of 15, resulting in a total board score (270 to 450). Using a secret ballot, panel members score the record individually with no discussion. Records are given to each panel member, and after they are scored, the ballots are given directly to a recorder. This ensures each panel member has scored each record independently.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.50.2.2. A record scored with a difference of more than 1 point between any of the panel members (for example, 8.5, 8.0, and 7.0) is termed a split vote and is returned to the panel for resolution. At this point, all panel members may discuss the record openly among themselves. This allows them to state why they scored the record as they did. Only those panel members directly involved in the split may change their scores. If panel members cannot come to an agreement on the split vote, they give the record to the board president for resolution. This ensures consistency of scoring and eliminates the possibility that one panel member will have a major impact (positive or negative) on an individual’s board score.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.50.2.3. Actual scores will vary between panels; the specific reason why certain panels scored the way they did cannot be determined because this is a subjective decision. However, because a single panel reviews each chief enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code, all records within a chief enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code are evaluated under the same standard. Some panels may award high scores, while others may award low ones. Therefore, whether a panel scores “easy” or “hard” is not significant. The important part of the final board score is how one eligible compares to his or her peers in the final order of merit. This allows each eligible to see how competitive he or she was.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.50.2.4. Because each board is completely independent, board members do not know how an individual scored or ranked during the previous cycle. Each board arrives at their own scoring standard. However, as long as everyone competing in a chief enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code is looked at under the same standard, fair and equitable consideration is ensured. A number of factors affect board scores from year to year—new panel members with different thought processes, previous promotion eligible with changed or improved records, and a large pool of new eligibles. As a result, board scores do vary (often significantly) from one board to the next.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.50.2.5. Board members do not have access to the weighted scores of individuals competing for promotion. Their primary concern is to align all eligible in a relative order of merit, based on their panel score, within their chief enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code. When board members leave, they do not know who was selected. They only know they have reviewed and scored each record within the standard that evolved from the trial run.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.50.3.<b class="calibre1"> Not Fully Qualified Process:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.50.3.1. A process associated with enlisted promotion boards often misunderstood is the not fully qualified process. As previously stated, senior NCO evaluation board members use the whole-person concept to align promotion eligible in a relative order of merit within their chief enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code based on the quality of each promotion eligible’s senior NCO evaluation record. Also, board members are formally charged to ensure individuals are not only best qualified, but also fully qualified to assume the responsibilities of the next higher grade.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.50.3.2. If the board determines an individual is not fully qualified based on an evaluation of the record, the individual is rendered not fully qualified for promotion. In this case, Air Force Personnel Center removes the individual from promotion consideration and deactivates his or her promotion record, rendering the individual ineligible for promotion. The parent major command and military personnel section are then notified of the board’s decision in writing. The parent major command must immediately notify the individual through the unit commander. The board is not allowed to disclose the exact rationale for their findings. However, factors contributing to the decision can be as general as an overall noncompetitive record when compared to peers or as specific as a demonstrated substandard performance and disciplinary problems. Additionally, the chief enlisted manager may have a very small number of eligibles and the board has exercised the authority to prevent promotion by default. In any event, the member is ineligible for that cycle.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.50.4.<b class="calibre1"> Post-Board Processing.</b> </p>
	<p class="block_6">After the board is finished, the weighted factor scores are combined with the board scores. This completely electronic operation builds an order of merit listing by total score within each chief enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code, and the overall promotion quota is then applied to each list. After the selection results are approved, the data is transmitted to the military personnel section. Questions regarding the Master Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant, and Chief Master Sergeant promotion selection process should be directed to the military personnel section career development element.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.50.5.<b class="calibre1"> Score Notice.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6"><span class="text_6">All eligible personnel receive a score notice that reports how they compare to their peers in their chief enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code in the specific promotion cycle. To determine weak areas, individuals can also compare their scores with the promotion statistics available in the military personnel section and/or posted on the Internet via the virtual military personnel flight. Personnel can access the virtual military personnel flight through the Air Force Personnel Center Web site at </span><a href="https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil" class="text_25">https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil</a><span class="text_7">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="calibre1">15.51.</b> <b class="calibre1">Supplemental Promotion Actions:</b></p>
	<p class="block_3">15.51.1. Reviewing the data verification record and senior NCO selection folder and taking prompt action to correct any errors provides the evaluation board the most accurate career assessment. However, if data errors or omissions occur, supplemental promotion consideration may be granted. Supplemental consideration is not granted if the error or omission appeared on the data verification record or in the automated records management system/personnel records display application and appropriate corrective and follow-up action was not taken prior to the board convening.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.51.2. Table 15.7 provides specific information concerning supplemental consideration. Requests for supplemental consideration are submitted in writing containing the unit commander’s recommendation and processed through the military personnel section.<b class="calibre1"> </b>In addition, the military personnel section can answer questions about the data verification record, which may eliminate the need for supplemental consideration.</p>

	<p class="block_32">15.52. Weighted Airman Promotion System Testing:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.52.1.<b class="calibre1"> General Responsibilities and Score Notices.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Preparing for promotion testing is solely an individual responsibility. Weighted Airman Promotion System score notices are a means to give Airmen a report of their relative standing in the promotion consideration process and should never be provided to or used by anyone other than the individual and his or her commander. An Airman’s scores cannot be disclosed without the Airman’s written consent. Commanders support staff, first sergeants, supervisors, etc., are not authorized access to an Airman’s Weighted Airman Promotion System scores. The commander has the specific duty to notify Airmen of promotion selection or non-selection results and may need to review their score notices to determine status. Commanders must restrict their use of the scores to notification and advisory counseling on behalf of the Airman and must not allow further dissemination of scores. Individuals may retrieve a copy of their score notice on the virtual military personnel flight after the initial promotion selection for the current cycle.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.52.2.<b class="calibre1"> Individual Responsibilities.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Personal involvement is critical. As a minimum, all Airmen testing must:</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.52.2.1. Know their promotion eligibility status.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.52.2.2. Maintain their specialty and military qualifications to retain their eligibility.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.52.2.3. Use a self-initiated program of individual study and effort to advance their career under Weighted Airman Promotion System.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.52.2.4. Obtain all current study references for a particular promotion cycle.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.52.2.5. Review the annual Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog to check availability and receipt of correct study references.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.52.2.6. Be prepared to test the first day of the testing window and throughout the testing cycle. Members who will be unavailable during the entire testing cycle due to a scheduled temporary duty must be prepared to test prior to temporary duty departure even if the temporary duty departure is before the first day of the testing cycle. Airman may opt to test early provided the correct test booklets are available.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.52.2.7. Ensure they receive at least 60 days of access to study materials prior to testing.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.52.2.8. (For Master Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant promotion eligibles) Ensure their selection folder at Air Force Personnel Center is accurate and complete.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.52.3.<b class="calibre1"> Data Verification Record.</b></p>
	<p class="block_78">The military personnel section will instruct eligible Airmen to obtain and review his or her data verification record on virtual military personnel flight to verify the data used in the promotion selection process. Each eligible Airman must review the data verification record and the master personnel records in the Automated Records Management System/Personnel Records Display Application and report any errors to the military personnel section. If an error is noted, the Airman must immediately contact his or her military personnel section for assistance. The military personnel section will update Military Personnel Data System with the correct data. Except for updating enlisted performance report data, each change will produce an updated promotion brief at Air Force Personnel Center and update the data verification record on virtual military personnel flight. The Airman’s receipt of the updated data verification record ensures changes were made. Airmen should verify the updated information. Supplemental promotion consideration may not be granted if an error or omission appeared on the data verification record and the individual took no corrective or follow-up action before the promotion selection date for Staff Sergeant through Master Sergeant, and before the original evaluation board for Senior Master Sergeant through Chief Master Sergeant. Individuals may retrieve a copy of their data verification record on virtual military personnel flight before the initial promotion selection for the current cycle.</p>
	<p class="block_1">Section 15J—Civilian Personnel Management and Programs</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.53. Civilian Personnel Services.</p>
	<p class="block_3">The Air Force provides most civilian personnel services from two sources: installation civilian personnel flights, usually located in the force support squadron, and Air Force Personnel Center. Air Force activities collocated on an Air Force installation with a civilian personnel flights, or within the same locality, are to be served by that civilian personnel flights<span class="calibre3">.  When an activity is not collocated or located near a </span>civilian personnel flights, services are to be provided by the nearest civilian personnel flights. Civilian Personnel Sections must service all civilian employees to ensure they are all included in the Air Force Civilian Personnel Program. Exceptions to the civilian personnel servicing arrangements are to be submitted to Air Force<span class="calibre3">/A1C for approval due to impact on Reduction in Force retention and bargaining unit representation.  This includes arrangements to centralize or decentralize civilian personnel servicing arrangements.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_8">15.54. Civilian Resource Management:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.54.1. While military pay is centrally managed by Headquarters United States Air Force, civilian pay is a budget line item at major command, field operating agency, and installation level, as well as at Headquarters United States Air Force. The availability of performance payout and numbers of authorized civilian positions comprise the base line for civilian employment levels. Civilian Pay funds are needed for civilian overtime; performance awards; special act awards; notable achievement awards, retention, recruitment, and relocation bonuses; student loan repayment program, seasonal and longer-term overhires; and voluntary separation incentive payments to minimize involuntary reduction-in-force separations and severance pay for affected employees as the result of reduction in force. Accurate requirement projections and development of employment plans are critical to support the workload demand within budget, while executing work <span class="calibre3">years, end strength and civilian pay resource.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_3">15.54.2. Civilian resource management is a team effort. Commanders and senior leaders depend on human resource officers, financial managers, and manpower officers to recommend effective use of employees, funds, and manpower authorizations to meet mission requirements. Major commands and installations use a corporate board structure, meeting at least quarterly, to manage annual appropriations, revolving funds, or reimbursements used for civilian employment costs.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.54.3. When funds are available, civilian overhire positions can be established to handle peak workloads, recurring annual programs, military manning shortfalls, or other short-notice requirements that cannot be met through normal manpower requirements or personnel assignment processes. Most overhire positions are filled using temporary appointments (not to exceed 1 year). If the workload continues beyond a year, term appointments of up to 5 years may be used. Permanent appointments to overhire positions are unusual, although a permanent employee may be placed in an overhire position in a reduction-in-force.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.55. Job Descriptions:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.55.1. Civilian employees, except those above grade General Schedule-15 do not have a rank. Instead, they take the grade of the position they occupy. Since the position is graded, not the employee, detailed written job descriptions are the basis for determining pay, qualification requirements, performance expectations, and appraisal ratings.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.55.2. Position descriptions historically have covered duties, responsibilities, and supervisory controls. The Air Force has expanded the scope of core personnel documents to include performance standards, qualifications required for recruitment, and training requirements for a new employee in the position.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.55.3. Supervisors are responsible for core personnel documents accuracy, and for implementing standard core personnel documents from a growing library of these documents. Air Force Personnel Center/DPIC (formally AFMA/MAH) coordinates standard core personnel document content with appropriate Headquarters United States Air Force functional representatives before issuing new standard core personnel documents. Supervisors who select standard core personnel documents save the time required to write a new document and the time a position classification specialist would need to determine the correct pay plan or schedule, occupation series or code, and grade. Standard core personnel documents can also be used as templates for a unique core personnel documents that requires a new classification analysis.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.55.4. Air Force civilian personnel sections with relatively large numbers of serviced civilian personnel retain position classification authority and responsibilities until they transition to Air Force Personnel Center/DPIC. Air Force Personnel Center/DPIC performs classification support for installations with smaller civilian employee populations. From either source, supervisors can seek assistance in developing core personnel documents or selecting or modifying standard core personnel documents.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.56. Filling Jobs:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.56.1. Vacant civilian positions are filled based on an organization’s needs using a variety of recruitment sources and  appointing authorities consistent with applicable laws, regulations, directives and policies as established by the Office of Personnel Management, Department of Defense, and Department of the Air Force. Referral and selection priorities must be observed when filling competitive service positions. Employees with mandatory selection or priority referral rights normally include those adversely affected by reduction-in-force through involuntary separation or demotion. These priorities may also include transfer of function declinations or transfer of work outside the commuting area, overseas returnees, reduction-in-force reclassification, civilian spouses, or spouses of Regular Air Force military following a change in duty location. Supervisors work in concert with their servicing Human Resource specialist in the civilian personnel sections or Air Force Personnel Center to determine appropriate recruitment sources. A vacancy for competitive fill actions is announced, candidates are screened by Air Force Personnel Center, and one or more lists of candidates are referred to the supervisor.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.56.2. Based on their qualifying experience and/or education, civilians can enter civil service at different pay grade levels. The competitive staffing process used by the Air Force and other Federal agencies determines the relative qualifications of the candidates and refers only the best qualified for selection. Office of Personnel Management provides agencies with qualification standards written broadly for government-wide application. The standards are covered by either a Group Standard (multiple occupations) or by Individual Occupation. The Group Standards cover occupations under Professional and Scientific, Administrative and Management, Technical and Medical Support, Clerical and Administrative Support and Student Trainee positions. Some occupations have education requirements identified in the qualification standards. The level of education is dependent upon the duties and the grade of the position. Many jobs in professional and related occupations require a 4-year college degree. Some of these occupations including engineers, physicians and surgeons, and biological and physical scientists require a bachelor’s or higher degree in a specific field of study. 5 United States Code, Section 3308 prohibits requiring education for positions that are competed, unless Office of Personnel Management has determined the duties of a scientific, technical, or professional position cannot be performed by an individual who does not have the prescribed minimum education. The minimum qualification requirements are listed on job announcements which may include specific job-related work experience, education level, medical or physical standards, training, security, certifications and/or licensure requirements.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.56.3. Competitive placements require collaboration between supervisors and human resource specialists at the civilian personnel sections or the Air Force Personnel Center. Human resource specialists advise supervisors regarding recruitment sources. The minimum area of consideration includes Department of Defense-wide, Transfer and Reinstatement eligibles for all locally and centrally managed permanent positions. Exceptions to the standard area of consideration will be limited to positions subject to the Developmental Team process, career broadener/intern outplacements and placements to minimize adverse action.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.56.4. Once established priority requirements are cleared, the vacancy is announced for competitive actions. The supervisor is issued a candidate referral list of qualified candidate names. Once the supervisor receives the candidate referral list, he or she may confer with the human resource specialist for interview procedures. If an interview is used as part of the selection process, the supervisor arranges the interview. Interviews are required for all General Schedule-14 and General Schedule-15 positions. Should the selecting official choose to interview, questions must be approved by the civilian personnel sections prior to use. All candidates should be asked the same questions, and the interview periods should be of relatively equal length. Some interview requirements may be defined by a locally negotiated agreement with the representative union.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.56.5. Centrally managed career programs cover most vacancies in grades General Schedule-12 through General Schedule-15. Senior functional managers set career development and placement policies for employees in career program covered positions. These positions are subject to the same recruitment processes as non-centrally managed positions.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.57. Training and Development.</p>
	<p class="block_3">Air Force policy provides for necessary training to improve skills needed in employee performance. Supervisors are responsible for determining training requirements and working with the civilian personnel sections or education and training function to identify appropriate training sources. Organizational funds must often be used to support training needs; however, civilian training funds are often available.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.57.1.<b class="calibre1"> Identifying Training Requirements:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.57.1.1. Conducted annually is a training-needs survey which provides the supervisor an opportunity to project training requirements for the upcoming fiscal year. Due to unforecasted mission requirements, however; supervisors may request an out-of-cycle training need at any time during the year.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.57.1.2. Although first-line supervisors are the key individuals in determining development needs, they may need additional guidance from higher-level management, other supervisors, or the employees themselves. The servicing employee development specialist is available to assist in training needs analysis and identification of methods and training sources.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.57.1.3. Not all training and developmental needs can or should be met through Air Force sponsorship. Employees are responsible for independently pursuing training and education that will prepare them for promotion or develop them for career transitions. Such self-development activity is employee initiated and accomplished during off-duty hours. Supervisors should encourage civilian employees to participate in self-development activities, when appropriate. Civilian tuition assistance is available in some major commands and field operating agencies.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.57.2.<b class="calibre1"> Training Sources:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.57.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Primary Training Sources.</b> Once training needs are identified, the next step is to determine training sources. The three primary sources of training are agency (Air Force), interagency, and nongovernment. Training away from the work site is requested, approved, and documented using Standard Form 182, <i class="calibre2">Authorization, Agreement and Certification of Training.</i></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.57.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Agency Training.</b> Agency training is conducted by the employer (Air Force) and may include on-the-job training, in-house training, and Air Force formal schools. On-the-job training and in-house training are often the most effective because the supervisor tailors the training to meet the specific job requirements. On-the-job training usually is as casual as giving a few pointers to a new worker or as formal as a fully structured training program with timetables and specified subjects. Therefore, on-the-job training can include directing employees to appropriate publications for self-study. Some functional activities also use in-house training. This type of training is very effective when a large number of employees need instruction on common aspects of occupational skill requirements. </p>
	<p class="block_6">15.57.2.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Air Force Formal Schools.</b> More formalized agency classroom training is available through Air Force formal schools listed in the Web-based <i class="calibre2">Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA)</i> located at <a href="https://etca.randolph.af.mil/" class="text_12">https://etca.randolph.af.mil/</a>. Career field management programs plan for and sponsor developmental assignments, tuition assistance, formal training, and education to develop current and future managers. Leadership and management developmental opportunities, including intermediate service school and senior service school, are available to eligible high-potential civilian employees. Information is available at <a href="http://www.afciviliancareers.com/apply/howtoapply/" class="text_12">www.afciviliancareers.com</a>.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.57.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Interagency Training.</b> This training may be needed if agency sources are not adequate to meet identified training needs. Interagency training includes all training sponsored by other United States government agencies. Office of Personnel Management, the United States Departments of Army and Navy, and the United States Departments of Labor and Agriculture are just a few sources from which to obtain training.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.57.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Nongovernmental Training.</b> Federal regulations require agencies to consider and select government training sources before turning to nongovernment alternatives. However, nongovernment sources may be considered when agency or interagency courses cannot satisfy the training need or when nongovernment training is more advantageous. Nongovernment sources incorporate a wide range of seminars, conferences, courses, and workshops, as well as curricula offered by private educational institutions.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.58. Performance, Conduct, and Discipline:</p>
	<p class="block_79">15.58.1. <b class="calibre1">Performance Planning, Appraisals, and Awards for Employees.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The employee is advised of the duties and responsibilities of the job and the supervisor’s performance expectations in their core personnel document. Employees receive annual appraisals on how well they perform their duties. Supervisors may reward employees for performing their duties well. A performance award is a management option to recognize high performance.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.58.1.1. Supervisors set the performance elements (duties and tasks) for the civilian employees they supervise. In developing an employee’s performance elements, supervisors determine the major and important requirements of the employee’s job based on the employee’s direct contribution to organization or work unit objectives.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.58.1.2. Performance standards prescribe how a particular element or duty must be accomplished. Set by supervisors, the standards must reflect levels necessary for acceptable performance. When possible, supervisors should identify observable behaviors that lead to success on the job. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b><i class="calibre2"> </i>Elements and standards are documented in writing on Air Force Form 860, <i class="calibre2">Civilian Performance Plan</i>, if a core personnel document is not used.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.58.1.3. The performance appraisal is the basis for personnel actions to identify and correct work performance problems, recognize and reward quality performance, improve productivity, and grant periodic pay increases. Supervisors review the employee’s performance of each element and rate the performance against each element’s standards and then render an overall summary rating. AFI 36-1001, <i class="calibre2">Managing the Civilian Performance Program</i>, provides guidance for evaluating civilian employee performance for General Schedule and Federal Wage System employees.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.58.1.4. Performance awards (performance cash award, time-off award, and quality step increase) can be used as tools to motivate General Schedule and Federal Wage System employees to perform above an acceptable level as well as compensate them for performing beyond expectations. Effective management of the performance awards program can help improve productivity and morale in the organization.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.58.1.5. Poor performance must be corrected. Employees who fail one or more performance elements are administered an unacceptable appraisal and will have an opportunity to improve. Causes for poor performance are identified (medical conditions, training deficiencies, etc.). However, if performance does not improve to a satisfactory level, the employee may be removed from the position. Placement in another position at the same or lower grade is possible. Separation from civilian employment is also possible.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.58.2.<b class="calibre1"> Personal Conduct:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.58.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Standards of Conduct.</b> AFI 36-703, <i class="calibre2">Civilian Conduct and Responsibility</i>, and the Department of Defense 5500.7-R, <i class="calibre2">Joint Ethics Regulation</i>, cover activities that are mandatory for civilian employees and activities that are prohibited. Employees are required to comply with standards of conduct in all official matters. Employees are expected to maintain high standards of honesty, responsibility, and accountability and to adhere to the Air Force core values of <i class="calibre2">Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do</i>.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.58.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Required Activities. </b>Among required activities are: furnishing testimony in official investigations and hearings consistent with protections against self-incrimination; paying lawful debts and taxes; being present for work unless authorized to be absent; complying with health, safety, and all other proper instructions regarding work; presenting a positive public image and complying with reasonable dress and grooming standards; and maintaining professional relationships with fellow workers, subordinates, and supervisors.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.58.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Prohibited Actions. </b>Prohibited actions follow the guidance in federal laws and government-wide regulations, as well as Department of Defense and Air Force instructions. Discrimination and sexual harassment, drug and alcohol abuse, misuse of government purchase cards, misuse of government computers, vehicles and other equipment, taking bribes, conducting personal business at work, and criminal behavior off-duty that reflect adversely on Air Force employment are among the prohibited activities. The Air Force does not attempt to list all possible forms of improper conduct but warns employees that misconduct will not be tolerated.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.58.3.<b class="calibre1"> Discipline:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.58.3.1. Disciplinary action is taken to correct employee misconduct or performance when the employee can control the essentials of the performance problems and has the skills, knowledge, and capacity to perform well but is unwilling to do so. Guidance is in AFI 36-704, <i class="calibre2">Discipline and Adverse Actions</i>.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.58.3.2. The Air Force goal in the area of civilian discipline is to maintain a constructive work environment. If a disciplinary or adverse action must be taken against a civilian employee, this action must be done without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or other factors (such as marital status or politics). Actions based on an employee’s inability to perform because of a physical or mental disability should only be taken when the employee’s disability cannot be reasonably accommodated.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.58.3.3. The employee must receive advance notice of impending actions. Disciplinary or adverse actions must be prompt and equitable and comply with the intent and letter of all governing requirements, and respect must be given to the private nature of the actions.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.58.3.4. Proper administration of discipline is a chief concern of labor organizations representing Air Force employees. Procedures governing disciplinary and adverse actions are common features of most Air Force labor-management agreements. Moreover, a basic tenet of federal labor relations law states that an employee who is a member of a bargaining unit has a right to union representation, upon the employee’s request, during an investigatory interview where the employee reasonably believes disciplinary action may result from the interview.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.58.3.5. Oral admonishment, the least severe disciplinary action, is often adequate to improve work habits or correct behavior. For significant misconduct or repeated infractions, a written reprimand may be an appropriate penalty. Written reprimands are recorded in the employee personnel record for a specified period, as directed by AFI 36-704, or an applicable negotiated labor-management contract.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.58.3.6. Suspension is a disciplinary action that may be imposed for more serious infractions when the situation indicates that a lesser penalty is not adequate. A suspension is a particularly severe disciplinary action that places the employee in a nonpay and nonduty status, usually for a specific length of time. Employees accused of serious crime may be suspended indefinitely until criminal justice is complete.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.58.3.7. For employees who have received oral admonishments, written reprimands, or suspensions and whose behavior continues to be inappropriate, or for such a onetime egregious event of misconduct, removal may occur. Like all other disciplinary actions, the supervisor must ensure the disciplinary action is warranted and well documented. Reprimands, suspensions, and removals must be coordinated with the civilian personnel sections and the staff judge advocate so a procedural violation or an administrative oversight does not jeopardize a valid disciplinary action.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.59. Working Conditions:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.59.1.<b class="calibre1"> Pay:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.59.1.1. Civilian employees are paid every 2 weeks. General Schedule employee pay is expressed as an annual salary and high cost areas have higher pay rates. All General Schedule pay rates in the United States include locality pay and pay rates overseas do not include locality pay and are approximately 10 percent lower than United States rates. General Schedule pay scales normally increase in January through the legislative process.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.59.1.2. The Federal Wage System consists of wage grade, wage leader, and wage supervisor. The Federal Wage System pay is expressed as hourly wage rates. Federal Wage System rates vary more between local areas than General Schedule. Federal Wage System rates may also be increased annually but on an area-by-area basis throughout the year.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.59.1.3. Both General Schedule and Federal Wage System have steps in each grade. Employees progress through the steps via longevity. The General Schedule grades have 10 steps. Within grade or step increases start at 1-year intervals, but slow to 3-year intervals in the higher steps. Federal Wage System grades have five steps. Federal Wage System within grade increases start at 6-month intervals and slow to 2-year intervals.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.59.1.4. Pay for overtime is at time-and-a-half or 1.5 times base pay. Overtime pay for General Schedule employees is capped at 1.5 times the GS-10, step 1, pay rate; for employees with rates of basic pay greater than the basic pay for General Schedule-10, step 1, the overtime hourly rate is the greater of either the hourly rate of basic pay for General Schedule-10, step 1, multiplied by 1.5, or the employee’s hourly rate of basic pay. Instead of overtime pay, an employee may receive compensatory time off for each hour of overtime worked. Work at night, on Sunday, and on a federal holiday earns extra pay.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.59.2.<b class="calibre1"> Work Hours:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.59.2.1. Civilian work hours are more precisely defined and less flexible than those of Regular Air Force military personnel. Civilian work schedules are defined in such terms as administrative workweek, basic workweek, regular tour of duty, uncommon tour of duty, and part-time tour of duty. Most civilians work a regular tour of duty. Normally, this is five 8-hour days, Monday through Friday. Uncommon tours of duty (a 40-hour basic workweek that includes Saturday and/or Sunday or fewer than 5 days, but not more than 6 days of a 7-day administrative workweek) are authorized when necessary for mission accomplishment.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.59.2.2. Special circumstances permit part-time, intermittent, or special tours of duty. Installation and tenant commanders establish, by written order, daily work hours to include designated rest and lunch periods. Two types of alternate work schedules can be implemented by organization commanders. Flexible work schedules allow employees to start and end work at different times. Compressed work schedules cover 80 hours in a pay period in fewer than 10 workdays. The most common schedule has four 9-hour days each week, an 8-hour day in 1 week, and a regular day off in the other week. AFI 36-807, <i class="calibre2">Weekly and Daily Scheduling of Work and Holiday Observances, </i>covers work scheduling.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.59.3.<b class="calibre1"> Absence and Leave:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">15.59.3.1. Civilian employees earn 13 days of sick leave each year and 13, 20, or 26 days of annual leave, depending on their length of service. Annual leave accumulation is capped at 30 days for most General Schedule and Federal Wage System employees. Employees working overseas can accumulate 45 days. There is no cap on sick leave accumulation.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.59.3.2. Annual leave is used for vacations and/or personal reasons and should be approved in advance of being taken, unless emergency conditions exist. Leave is charged and taken in 15-minute increments. Sick leave for medical appointments or care for a family member should be scheduled and approved in advance except in cases of emergency. Illness or injury that keeps an employee away from work should be reported to a supervisor during the first two hours of the duty day.</p>
	<p class="block_6">15.59.3.3. Absence for jury duty, dismissals for extreme weather conditions, or absences excused by the installation commander are not charged to annual leave. Employees who have earned compensatory time for overtime or time-off awards should schedule absences to use that time like they schedule annual leave. Absence and leave are covered in AFI 36-815, <i class="calibre2">Absence and Leave.</i></p>
	<p class="block_8">15.60. Unions in the Air Force:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.60.1. Approximately 70 percent of Air Force civilian employees are covered by labor agreements between unions and installations or major commands. As such, they are members of the bargaining unit, even if they are not dues-paying union members. Unions have legal status under federal law. Guidance is included in AFI 36-701, <i class="calibre2">Labor Management Relations.</i></p>
	<p class="block_3">15.60.2. A labor relations officer or specialist in the civilian personnel sections is the usual liaison between supervisors and other management officials and union officials. The job can be full-time or part of a larger assignment. The labor relations officer speaks for management in routine communications with the union and with parties outside the Air Force who have roles in labor contract negotiations and dispute resolution.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.60.3. A variety of union officials may act for, and make commitments for, unions. These include elected officers such as the president, vice president, and treasurer; and appointed officials such as stewards and union delegates to special meetings or projects. As part of a democratic organization, the union official may be required to present issues to a committee, such as a bargaining committee for approval. At other times, the official may have been delegated authority to make commitments. One of the duties of union officials is to raise employee concerns in the early stages of policy formulation and to resolve employee complaints. Managers should strive to work with union officials, particularly where grievances have been filed, in a professional, nondefensive manner.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.60.4. Management and union representatives negotiate collective bargaining agreements (contracts) covering grievance procedures, use of official time for union matters, use of Air Force resources by unions such as office space, telephone, and computers, and other local or major command-wide items of interest impacting the working conditions of bargaining unit employees. These contracts bind both sides with agreements subject to interpretation by third parties outside Department of Defense and Air Force; for example, the Federal Labor Relations Authority and/or arbitrators. Contracts do not cover pay, benefits, or other matters governed by Federal laws and government-wide regulations. However, revised Air Force instructions that differ from provisions in a contract may need to be negotiated. In recent years, civilian performance appraisal changes were not implemented at some installations until conclusion of lengthy negotiations between management and unions.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.61. Dispute Resolution:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.61.1. Civilian employees have a variety of avenues to resolve disputes. Labor-management contracts must include a negotiated grievance procedure that must be used by members of the bargaining unit. Most start with an option to seek resolution using outside neutral facilitators or mediators (alternative dispute resolution). Formal grievances follow two or more steps before one side decides to refer the dispute to a paid, outside arbitrator. Costs are usually shared equally by the union and management, so union decisions to pursue arbitration are not routine. Subject to challenge on points of law or contract terms, arbitrators’ decisions are final.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.61.2. Supervisors, managers, and employees who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, or who are not members of the bargaining unit follow different grievance procedures. AFI 36-1203, <i class="calibre2">Administrative Grievance System,</i> covers the administrative grievance process. Administrative grievances are decided by Air Force officials, usually the installation commander or designee, although outside fact finders may be used at management’s option. </p>
	<p class="block_3">15.61.3. A number of personnel decisions, for example, nonselection for promotion and performance recognition, are excluded from administrative grievances and most negotiated grievance procedures. Appeals of adverse actions covered by legal appeal rights are also excluded from the administrative grievance system. The Merit System Protection Board hears appeals of suspensions without pay of more than 14 days, demotions (change to lower grade), and removals. Disputes pursued as grievances cannot be duplicated as equal employment opportunity complaints and vice versa. Appeals of adverse actions that include allegations of discrimination may be reviewed by both Merit System Protection Board and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.61.4. A different route is taken to resolve union/management disputes concerning the statutory rights of either party. The Federal Labor Relations Authority investigates charges of unfair labor practice brought by either union or management. The union files most unfair labor practice charges when managers or supervisors are accused of changing working conditions or calling formal meetings without proper notice to the union. If found guilty, management may be required to revert back to the previous working condition, and the organization commander, including a wing commander, can be required to post an admission of managements wrong doing on official base bulletin boards.</p>
	<p class="block_8">15.62. Conclusion:</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.62.1. The Air Force mission requires military members to be prepared for service at all times. Force support organizations ensure Airmen’s families are cared for, pay and entitlements are properly addressed, and their individual rights are secure. This chapter included information on enlisted assignments, family care, reenlistment and retraining opportunities, benefits and services, personnel records and individual rights, the awards and decorations program, and the Airman Promotion system.</p>
	<p class="block_3">15.62.2. This chapter continued with the Senior NCOs Promotion Program, identifying how manpower requirements are quantified and how supervisors initiate changes, and using competitive sourcing to maximize cost-effectiveness, efficiency and enhance mission capability by taking advantage of services available through the private commercial sector. This chapter also introduced civilian personnel management, covering such areas as job descriptions, filling positions, training, performance, conduct, and discipline; and working conditions, equal employment opportunity working conditions, and unions. Senior NCOs require a basic understanding of the subject areas to effectively lead.</p>

	<p class="block_3">4.1. Introduction:</p>
	<p class="block_4">4.1.1. America’s Air Force faces significant challenges. We have been engaged in combat while transforming into a smaller, leaner, and more capable force. Fiscal constraints combined with operational challenges and a dynamic international security environment translate into risks we continue to manage and mitigate in order to provide capabilities America needs. The Air Force continues to fight the war on terrorism and prepares to face new threats and conflicts of the future. In order to remain dominant, we must maintain our airpower advantages over potential adversaries. Modern warfare is changing. This is not new for America’s Airmen, whose heritage spans and embraces change and whose culture embodies courage and innovation.</p>
	<p class="block_4">4.1.2. Meeting the challenges in this rapidly changing world requires we understand and apply Air Force doctrine. Airmen may not have understood or consistently applied doctrine. The complexity of integrating fighting elements according to joint, Air Force and multinational doctrine and the uncertainty inherent in rapidly developing contingency operations demand that planning and employment be understood and repeatable. We must learn and practice our own doctrine. We know how to do it right; we have taken the time to research, write it down, and publish it. We must understand what it means to be an Airman, and we must be able to articulate what air power can bring to the joint fight. Volume 1, <i class="calibre2">Air Force Basic Doctrine,</i> is the Air Force’s premier statement of our beliefs, and the cornerstone upon which our service identity is based. Air Force Doctrine is developed by the LeMay Center for Doctrine Development and Education at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. Air Force doctrine is web-based, and is available at <a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/" class="text_1">https://doctrine.af.mil/</a>.</p>
	<p class="block_4">4.1.3. Air Force forces are presented to a joint force commander as an air expeditionary task force, or may be composed of the air component to the joint task force or combatant commander (CCDR) as the C-Numbered Air Force or C-Major Command. The AEF is the Air Force methodology to provide Air Force forces and support on a rotational, predictable basis. Three principles are the foundation upon which the AEF is structured and executed: transparency, predictability, and equitability. Transparency is the sense that there is no mystery to the process; when, why, and how should be visible and understandable by every Airman. Every Air Force member is responsible for knowing and understanding the AEF original structure, how we deploy today’s AEF, and our goals for the future. By aligning forces in AEF bands and utilizing the teaming concept our Air Force is able to determine who goes first, defines our battle rhythm, and provides a logically organized structure during surge periods to support CCDRs. The AEF is merely a vehicle for managing and scheduling Air Force forces for expeditionary purposes; it is not a warfighting organization. The Air Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) is normally the warfighting organization attached to the JFC.</p>
	<p class="block_5">4.1.4. Joint warfare is team warfare. Over time, the American experience in war increasingly demanded cooperation, coordination, and integration of all U.S. military Services. Today, joint operations are routine and, thus, routinely practiced. Effectively integrated joint forces are able to rapidly and efficiently identify and engage adversary weak points and vulnerabilities, without exposing their own weak points or seams, to ensure mission accomplishment. Whether there are years to prepare and plan (as in the World War II Normandy invasion), months (as in Operation DESERT STORM), or only a few weeks (as in Operation ENDURING FREEDOM), American armed forces must always be ready to operate in smoothly functioning, joint teams.</p>

	<p class="block_3">4.2. Uses of Doctrine. </p>
	<p class="block_6">One way to explore good doctrine is to use a “compare and contrast” model to walk through some key issues. This technique also amplifies the point that doctrine should be written broadly, allowing decision makers latitude in interpretation and flexibility in application, yet be specific enough to provide informed guidance. This technique also illustrates the use of doctrine in explaining contentious issues and how doctrine can be used to think more effectively about the best means to integrate various aspects of military power and organization. In the following discussion, there may be overlap among some of the principles expressed; this is desirable in that often there are different aspects or nuances to a particular issue. In doctrine, language is important. Finally, the following discussion presents an Air Force perspective; not all Services may entirely agree with these points. (<a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="text_1">Reference: Volume 1 – Basic Doctrine</a>)</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.2.1. Doctrine is about <span class="text_">warfighting</span>, not <span class="text_">physics</span>. This principle specifically addresses the perceived differences between operations in air, space, and cyberspace. Air, space, and cyberspace are separate domains requiring exploitation of different sets of physical laws to operate in, but are linked by the effects they can produce together. To achieve a common purpose, air, space, and cyberspace capabilities need to be integrated. Therefore, Air Force doctrine focuses on the best means to obtain warfighting effects regardless of the medium in which a platform operates. As an example, Airmen should be concerned with the best means of employing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, not whether a particular intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platform is airborne or in orbit. This is requisite to achieving true integration across any given collection of forces.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.2.2. Doctrine is about <span class="text_">effects</span>, not <span class="text_">platforms</span>. This focuses on the desired outcome of a particular action, not on the system or weapon itself that provides the effect. For example, doctrine states that Airmen should seek to achieve air superiority, but doctrine does not focus on which platforms should be used to achieve that effect. A parallel example of this is seen in the recognition that bombers are not “strategic,” nor are fighters “tactical.” Similarly, it does not matter if an F-16 or a B-52 accomplishes a given task, or whether a particular platform is manned or unmanned, or whether a C-17 or a C-130 delivers a certain load; the outcome of the mission, the effect achieved, is what’s important. Thus, Air Force doctrine does not explicitly tie specific weapon systems to specific tasks or effects.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.2.3. Doctrine is about <span class="text_">using mediums</span>, not <span class="text_">owning mediums</span>. This illustrates the importance of properly using a medium to obtain the best warfighting effects, not of carving up the battlespace based on Service or functional parochialism. Focusing on using a medium is a vital first step to integration of efforts. “Ownership” arguments eventually lead to suboptimal (and usually at best tactical) application of efforts at the expense of the larger, total effort.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.2.4. Doctrine is about <span class="text_">organization</span>, not <span class="text_">organizations</span>. Modern warfare demands that disparate parts of different Services, different nations, and even differing functions within a single Service be brought together intelligently to achieve unity of command and unity of effort. However, merely placing different organizations together in an area of operations is insufficient to meet these demands. A single, cohesive organization is required with clearly defined lines of command and commanders with requisite authorities at appropriate levels. Doctrine explains why certain organizational structures are preferred over others and describes effective command relationships and command authorities; this facilitates the rapid standup of joint and Service organizations during rapidly evolving situations. Ultimately, doctrine is not about whether one particular element of a joint force is more decisive than another, nor about positing that element as the centerpiece of joint operations; it’s the total, tailored joint force that’s decisive. Getting to that effective joint force requires smart organization and a thorough understanding of Service and joint doctrine.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.2.5. Doctrine is about <span class="text_">synergy</span>, not <span class="text_">segregation</span>. True integration of effort cannot be achieved by merely carving up the operational environment. While segregation may have some benefit and may appear the simplest way, from a command and control viewpoint, to manage elements of a diverse joint force, it may actually suboptimize the overall effort. It guarantees that the whole will never be greater than the sum of its parts. For example, Airmen should have access to the entire theater of operations to maximize their ability to achieve joint force commander objectives; they should not be restricted from any area due to unnecessarily restrictive fire control measures. Also, segregating the battlespace into smaller areas of operation may create competition for scarce, high-demand, low-density capabilities and reduce combat effectiveness.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.2.6. Doctrine is about <span class="text_">integration</span>, not just <span class="text_">synchronization</span>. Synchronization is defined as “the arrangement of military actions in time, space, and purpose to produce maximum relative combat power at a decisive place and time” (Joint Publication 1-02). Integration, by comparison, is defined as “the arrangement of military forces and their actions to create a force that operates by engaging as a whole” (Joint Publication 1-02). Synchronization is, in essence, deconfliction in time and space between different units. A useful means is to plan and execute operations and to prevent fratricide. However, it doesn’t scale up to the operational level and hence is not the best means for achieving the maximum potential of a joint force. Synchronization emphasizes timing, while integration considers priority and effect to be both efficient and effective with scarce resources. Synchronization is bottom-up; integration, on the other hand, starts at the top with a single cohesive plan and works downward. Synchronization is an additive “sum of the parts” model, while integration may produce geometric results.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.2.7. Doctrine is about <span class="text_">the right force</span>, not just <span class="text_">equal shares of the force</span>. This addresses the proper mix of Service components within a joint force. Some believe that a joint force requires equal parts of all the Services. This is an incorrect view. As one senior Air Force officer said, “joint warfighting is not like Little League baseball, where everybody gets a chance to play.” Any given joint force should be tailored appropriately for the task at hand. Some operations will be land-centric, others air-centric, others maritime-, cyberspace-, or information-centric. The composition of the joint force and the tasks assigned its various elements should reflect the needs of the situation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">4.3. Levels of Airpower Doctrine. </p>
	<p class="block_6">As implemented in the Air Force, doctrine affects operations at three levels: basic, operational, and tactical. These levels speak to the intellectual content of the doctrinal concepts, not to the architectural structure of doctrine publications. (<a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="text_1">Reference: Volume 1 – Basic Doctrine</a>)</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Basic doctrine </b>states the most fundamental and enduring beliefs that describe and guide the proper use, presentation, and organization of forces in military action. Basic doctrine describes the “elemental properties” of airpower and provides the Airman’s perspective. Because of its fundamental and enduring character, basic doctrine provides broad and continuing guidance on how Air Force forces are organized, employed, equipped, and sustained. Because it expresses broad, enduring fundamentals, basic doctrine changes relatively slowly compared to the other levels of doctrine. As the foundation of all doctrine, basic doctrine also sets the tone and vision for doctrine development for the future. Air Force Doctrine Volume 1 is the Air Force’s basic doctrine publication.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> Operational doctrine </b>contained in doctrine annexes describe more detailed organization of forces and applies the principles of basic doctrine to military actions. Operational doctrine guides the proper organization and employment of air, space, and cyberspace forces in the context of distinct objectives, force capabilities, broad functional areas, and operational environments. Operational doctrine provides the focus for developing the missions and tasks to be executed through tactical doctrine. Doctrine at this level changes a bit more rapidly than basic doctrine, but usually only after deliberate internal Service debate.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.3.3.<b class="calibre1"> Tactical doctrine </b>describes the proper employment of specific Air Force assets, individually or in concert with other assets, to accomplish detailed objectives. Tactical doctrine considers particular objectives (stopping the advance of an armored column) and conditions (threats, weather, and terrain) and describes how Air Force assets are employed to accomplish the tactical objective (B-1 bombers dropping anti-armor cluster munitions). Air Force tactical doctrine is codified as tactics, techniques, and procedures in Air Force (Air Force tactics, techniques, and procedures) -3 series manuals. Because tactical doctrine is closely associated with the employment of technology and emerging tactics, change will likely occur more rapidly than other levels of doctrine. Also, due to their sensitive nature, many tactics, techniques, and procedures are classified.</p>
	<p class="block_7">4.4. Airpower: </p>
	<p class="block_6">4.4.1.<b class="calibre1"> Airpower is defined as “the ability to project military power or influence through the control and exploitation of air, space, and cyberspace to achieve strategic, operational, or tactical objectives.” </b>The proper application of airpower requires a comprehensive doctrine of employment and an Airman’s perspective. As the nation’s most comprehensive provider of military airpower, the Air Force conducts continuous and concurrent air, space, and cyberspace operations. The air, space, and cyberspace capabilities of the other Services serve primarily to support their organic maneuver paradigms; the Air Force employs air, space, and cyberspace capabilities with a broader focus on theater-wide and national-level objectives. Through airpower, the Air Force provides the versatile, wide-ranging means towards achieving national objectives with the ability to deter and respond immediately to crises anywhere in the world. (<a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="text_1">Reference: Volume 1 – Basic Doctrine</a>)</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> Airpower exploits the third dimension of the operational environment; the electromagnetic spectrum; and time to leverage speed, range, flexibility, precision, tempo, and lethality to create effects from and within the air, space, and cyberspace domains. </b>From this multi-dimensional perspective, Airmen can apply military power against an enemy’s entire array of diplomatic, informational, military, and economic instruments of power, at long ranges and on short notice. Airpower can be applied across the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war simultaneously, significantly increasing the options available to national leadership. Due to its range, speed, and flexibility, airpower can compress time, controlling the tempo of operations in our favor. Airpower should be employed with appropriate consideration of land and maritime power, not just during operations against enemy forces, but when used as part of a team that protects and aids friendly forces as well.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.4.2.1. Much of what airpower can accomplish from within these three domains is done to critically affect events in the land and maritime domains—this is the heart of joint domain integration, a fundamental aspect of airpower’s contribution to United States (U.S.) national interests. Airmen integrate capabilities across air, space, and cyberspace domains to achieve effects across all domains in support of joint force commander objectives. For example, a remotely piloted aircraft operating from a ground station in the continental U.S. relies on space and cyberspace capabilities to support operations overseas. While all Services rely more and more on such integration, cross-domain integration is fundamental to how Airmen employ airpower to complement the joint force.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.4.2.2. Airmen exploit the third dimension, which consists of the entire expanse above the earth’s surface. The third dimensions lower limit is the earth’s surface (land or water), and the upper limit reaches toward infinity. This third dimension consists of the air and space domains. From an operational perspective, the air domain can be described as that region above the earth’s surface in which aerodynamics generally govern the planning and conduct of military operations, while the space domain can be described as that region above the earth’s surface in which astrodynamics generally govern the planning and conduct of military operations. Airmen also exploit operational capabilities in cyberspace. Cyberspace is “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.” In contrast to our surface-oriented sister Services, the Air Force uses air, space, and cyberspace capabilities to create effects, including many on land and in the maritime domains, that are ends unto themselves, not just in support of predominantly land or maritime force activities.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.4.2.3. The evolution of contemporary airpower stems from the Airman’s original vision of combat from a distance, bypassing the force-on-force clash of surface combat. Originally manifest in long-range aircraft delivering kinetic weapons, airpower has evolved over time to include many long-range supporting capabilities, notably the conduct of networked information-related operations. This evolution has accelerated as Airmen conduct a greater percentage of operations not just over-the-horizon but globally, expanding operations first through space and now also in cyberspace. Just as airpower grew from its initial use as an adjunct to surface operations, space and cyberspace have likewise grown from their original manifestations as supporting capabilities into warfighting arenas in their own right.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.4.3.<b class="calibre1"> Air Force doctrine presents airpower as a unitary construct. </b>The Air Force acknowledges the importance of the space and cyberspace domains. However, Air Force doctrine should address what unifies Airmen.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Thus, in the Air Force’s senior doctrine product, the use of concepts and language that bind Airmen together instead of presenting the Air Force as a collection of tribes broken out in technological stovepipes according to the domains of air, space, and cyberspace is appropriate. Other subordinate doctrine products delve into the differences and interdependencies of the core functions and missions conducted within and across the air, space, and cyberspace domains, and within the context of more specific types of operations. Where appropriate, this product will also mention air, space, and cyberspace forces or capabilities.</p>
	<p class="block_7">4.5. The Airman’s Perspective. </p>
	<p class="block_6">The practical application of “airmindedness” results in the Airman’s unique perspective, which can be summarized as follows. (<a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="text_1">Reference: Volume 1 – Basic Doctrine</a>)</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.5.1.<b class="calibre1"> Control of the vertical dimension is generally a necessary precondition for control of the surface. </b>The first mission of an air force is to defeat or neutralize the enemy air forces so friendly operations on land, sea, in the air, and in space can proceed unhindered, while at the same time one’s own military forces and critical vulnerabilities remain safe from air attack.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.5.2.<b class="calibre1"> Airpower is an inherently strategic force. </b>War and peace are decided, organized, planned, supplied, and commanded at the strategic level of war. Air Force forces can hold an enemy’s strategic centers of gravity and critical vulnerabilities directly at risk immediately and continuously. Airpower also has great strategic capability for non-lethal strategic influence, as in humanitarian relief and building partnership activities.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.5.3.<b class="calibre1"> Airpower can exploit the principles of mass and maneuver simultaneously to a far greater extent than surface forces. </b>There are no natural lateral boundaries to prevent air, space, and cyberspace capabilities from quickly concentrating their power (physically or in terms of delivered effects) at any point, even when starting from widely dispersed locations. Airpower dominates the fourth dimension—time—and compresses the tempo of events to produce physical and psychological shock.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.5.4.<b class="calibre1"> Airpower can apply force against many facets of enemy power. </b>Air Force provided capabilities can be brought to bear against any lawful target within an enemy’s diplomatic, informational, military, economic, and social structures simultaneously or separately. They can be employed in support of national, combined/joint, or other component objectives. They can be integrated with surface power or employed independently.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.5.5.<b class="calibre1"> Air Force forces are less culturally intrusive in many scenarios. </b>Surface forces are composed of many people and vehicles which, when arrayed for operations, cover a significant area. Thus, their presence may be very visible to local populations and may create resentment during certain types of stability operations and in counterinsurgency operations. Air Force forces, operating from bases over the horizon or from just a few bases in-country, have a smaller footprint for the effects they provide. Space and cyberspace forces have a negligible in-theater footprint relative to the capabilities they provide.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.5.6.<b class="calibre1"> Airpower’s inherent speed, range, and flexibility combine to make it one of the most versatile components of military power. </b>This versatility component allows it to be rapidly employed against strategic, operational, and tactical objectives simultaneously. The versatility of airpower derives not only from the inherent characteristics of air forces themselves, but also from the manner in which they are organized and controlled.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.5.7.<b class="calibre1"> Airpower results from the effective integration of capabilities, people, weapons, bases, logistics, and all supporting infrastructure. </b>No one aspect of air, space, and cyberspace capabilities should be treated in isolation since each element is essential and interdependent. Ultimately, the Air Force depends on the performance of the people who operate, command, and sustain air, space, and cyberspace forces.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.5.8.<b class="calibre1"> The choice of appropriate capabilities is a key aspect in the realization of airpower. </b>Weapons should be selected based on their ability to create desired effects on an adversary’s capability and will. Achieving the full potential of airpower requires timely, actionable intelligence and sufficient command and control capabilities to permit commanders to exploit precision, speed, range, flexibility, and versatility.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.5.9.<b class="calibre1"> Supporting bases with their people, systems, and facilities are essential to launch, recovery, and sustainment of Air Force forces. </b>One of the most important aspects of the Air Force has proved to be its ability to move anywhere in the world quickly and then rapidly begin operations. However, the need for mobility should be balanced against the need to operate at the deployment site. The availability and operability of suitable bases can be the dominant factor in employment planning and execution.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.5.10.<b class="calibre1"> Airpower’s unique characteristics necessitate that it be centrally controlled by Airmen. </b>Airpower can quickly intervene anywhere, regardless if used for strategic or tactical purposes. Thus, Airmen tend to take a broader view of war, because the capabilities they command have effects at broader levels of war. Airmen apply airpower through the tenet of centralized control and decentralized execution.</p>
	<p class="block_7">4.6. Principles of Joint Operations: </p>
	<p class="block_6">4.6.1. Throughout the history of conflict, military leaders have noted certain principles that tended to produce military victory. Known as the principles of war, they are those aspects of warfare that are universally true and relevant. As members of the joint team, Airmen should appreciate how these principles apply to all forces, but should most fully understand them as they pertain to Air Force forces. Airpower, no matter which Service operates the systems and no matter which type of platform is used, provides unique capabilities.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.6.2. Valid principles, despite how deeply they are held, are no substitute for sound, professional judgment; however, ignoring them completely assumes unnecessary risk. The complexity of war in general, and the unique character of each war in particular, preclude commanders from using these principles as a checklist to guarantee victory. Rather, they serve as valuable guides to evaluate potential courses of action. The principles are independent, but tightly fused in application. No one principle should be considered without due consideration of the others. These principles are not all inclusive; the art of developing airpower strategies depends upon the Airman’s ability to view these principles from a three-dimensional perspective and integrate their application accordingly. The principles of war, combined with the additional tenets of airpower discussed elsewhere, provide the basis for a sound and enduring doctrine for the air, space, and cyberspace forces of America’s joint force. (<a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="text_1">Reference: Volume 1 – Basic Doctrine</a>)</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.6.3. The principles of war are:</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Unity of command ensures concentration of effort for every objective under one responsible commander. </b>This principle emphasizes that all efforts should be directed and coordinated toward a common objective. Airpower’s operational-level perspective calls for unity of command to gain the most effective and efficient application. Coordination may be achieved by cooperation; however, coordination is best achieved by vesting a single commander with the authority and the capability to direct all force employment in pursuit of a common objective. In many operations, the wide-ranging interagency and nongovernmental organizations involved may dilute unity of command. Effective information-sharing arrangements may preserve unity of effort to ensure common focus and mutually supporting actions.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.1.1. Unity of command is vital in employing airpower. Airpower is the product of multiple capabilities, and centralized control is essential to effectively fuse these capabilities and provide unity of command.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> The principle of objective is to direct military operations toward a defined and attainable objective that contributes to strategic, operational, and tactical aims. </b>In application, this principle refers to unity of effort in purpose, space, and time. In a broad sense, this principle holds that political and military goals should be complementary and clearly articulated. A clear National Military Strategy provides focus for defining campaign or theater objectives. At the operational level, campaign or theater objectives determine military priorities.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.2.1. The objective is important due to the flexibility and versatility of airpower. From the outset, airpower can pursue tactical, operational, or strategic objectives, in any combination, or all three simultaneously. By integrating the potential offered by air, space, and cyberspace capabilities, Airmen can overcome the challenges imposed by distance and time. From an Airman’s perspective, then, the principle of objective shapes priorities to allow airpower to concentrate on theater or campaign priorities and seeks to avoid the siphoning of force elements to fragmented objectives.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.3.<b class="calibre1"> The purpose of an offensive action is to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. </b>The offensive aim is to act rather than react and to dictate the time, place, purpose, scope, intensity, and pace of operations. The initiative should be seized as soon as possible. The principle of the offensive holds that offensive action, or initiative, provides the means for joint forces to dictate operations. Once seized, the initiative should be retained and fully exploited.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.3.1. This principle is particularly significant to airpower and is best used as an offensive weapon. While defense may be dictated by the combat situation, success in war is generally attained only while on the offensive. Even highly successful defensive air campaigns such as the World War II Battle of Britain were based upon selective offensive engagements.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.3.2. The speed and range of attacking airpower gives it a significant offensive advantage over other forces. In an air attack, for example, the defender often requires more forces to defend a given geospatial area than the attacker requires to strike a set of specific targets. The integration of air, space, and cyberspace capabilities enhances the advantages of speed, range and persistence found in airpower.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.3.3. Although all military forces have offensive capabilities, airpower’s ability to mass and maneuver, and its ability to operate independently or simultaneously at the tactical, operational, and/or strategic levels of war, provides joint force commanders a resource with global reach to directly and rapidly seize the initiative. Whether deploying forces and supplies into a region, conducting combat operations, or maintaining information assurance, airpower provides the joint force commander the means to take the offensive. Through prompt and sustained offensive actions designed to attain operational and strategic objectives, airpower causes the enemy to react rather than act, denies them the offensive, and shapes the remainder of the conflict.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.4.<b class="calibre1"> The purpose of mass is to concentrate the effects of combat power at the most advantageous place and time to achieve decisive results. </b>Concentration of military power is a fundamental consideration in all military operations. At the operational level of war, this principle suggests that superior, concentrated combat power is used to achieve decisive results.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.4.1. Airpower is singularly able to launch an attack from widely dispersed locations and mass combat power at the objective, whether that objective is a single physical location or a widely dispersed enemy system or systems. From an Airman’s perspective, mass is not based solely on the quantity of forces and materiel committed. Airpower achieves mass through effectiveness of attack, not just overwhelming numbers. Contemporary airpower has altered the concept of massed forces. The speed, range, and flexibility of airpower—complemented by the accuracy and lethality of precision weapons and advances in information technologies—allow it to achieve mass faster than other forces.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.4.2. Air Force cyberspace capabilities, often enabled by space systems, allow dispersed forces to collaborate to rapidly find, fix, track, and target fleeting targets and mass a response in new ways. Previously, operators and planners worked in relative proximity within the same theater of operations; today, those same planners and operators leverage distributed capabilities to apply precise effects around the globe.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.4.3. Airlift and air refueling provide a significant and critical capability to mass lethal and nonlethal forces on a global scale. The capability of airpower to act quickly and mass effects, along with its capability to mass other lethal and nonlethal military power, combine the principle of mass with the principle of maneuver.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.5.<b class="calibre1"> Maneuver places the enemy in a position of disadvantage through the flexible application of combat power in a multidimensional combat space. </b>Airpower’s ability to conduct maneuver is not only a product of its speed and range, but also flows from its flexibility and versatility during the planning and execution of operations. Maneuver, like the principle of offensive, forces the enemy to react, allowing the exploitation of successful friendly operations and reducing friendly vulnerabilities. Airpower maneuver allows engagement anywhere, from any direction, at any time, forcing the adversary to be on guard everywhere.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.5.1. The principle of maneuver is not limited to simple weapons delivery. Maneuver may involve the strategic positioning of capabilities that bring potential airpower to bear within striking distance of potential or actual adversaries. Forward deployment of airpower assets is one example of maneuver that, by its very presence, can reassure allies and deter aggressors. Also, in airlift operations such as SUPPORT HOPE in Rwanda, PROVIDE HOPE in the former Soviet Union, or PROVIDE PROMISE in Bosnia; focused civil-military operations and exercises that support theater security cooperation goals, such as PACIFIC ANGEL; or combat operations such as ALLIED FORCE in Serbia, ENDURING FREEDOM in Afghanistan, or IRAQI FREEDOM in Iraq, airpower has played a critical role in American national security by providing unmatched maneuverability. Whether it involves airlift or attack aircraft, in small or large numbers, the versatility and responsiveness of airpower allow the simultaneous application of mass and maneuver.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.6.<b class="calibre1"> Economy of force is the judicious employment and distribution of forces. </b>Its purpose is to allocate minimum essential resources to secondary efforts. This principle calls for the rational use of force by selecting the best mix of air, space, and cyberspace capabilities. To ensure overwhelming combat power is available, maximum effort should be devoted to primary objectives. At the operational level of war, commanders ensure that any effort made towards secondary objectives does not degrade achievement of the larger operational or strategic objectives. This principle requires Airmen to maintain a broader operational view even as they seek to obtain clearly articulated objectives and priorities.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.6.1. Economy of force may require a commander to establish a balance in the application of airpower between attacking, defending, delaying, or conducting other operations such as information operations, depending on the importance of the area or the priority of the objective or objectives. Also, priorities may shift rapidly; friendly troops in contact might drive a change in priority from one type of mission (e.g., interdiction) to another (e.g., close air support). Although this principle suggests the use of overwhelming force in one sense, it also recommends guarding against the “overkill” inherent in the use of more force than reasonably necessary. This is particularly relevant when excessive force can diminish the legitimacy and support for an operation.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.7.<b class="calibre1"> The purpose of security is to never permit the enemy to acquire unexpected advantage. </b>Friendly forces and their operations should be protected from enemy action that could provide the enemy with unexpected advantage. The lethal consequences of enemy attack make the security of friendly forces a paramount concern.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.7.1. Critical to security is the understanding that it embraces physical security, operations security, and security of the information environment. Information has always been part of air, land, and sea warfare; now, with the proliferation of advanced communications and computer technologies, it becomes even more central to the outcome of a conflict.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.7.2.<b class="calibre1"> Aircraft are most vulnerable on the ground. </b>Thus, force protection is an integral part of airpower employment. Fixed bases are especially vulnerable as they not only should withstand aerial, ground, and cyberspace attacks, but should also sustain concentrated and prolonged air, space, and cyberspace activities against the enemy.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.7.3. From an Airman’s perspective, <b class="calibre1">security also may be obtained by staying beyond the enemy’s reach, physically and virtually. </b>Airpower is uniquely suited to capitalize on this through its ability to operate over the horizon. Not only can airpower reach and strike at extended range, but it also can distribute data and analysis as well as command and control across a worldwide span.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.7.4. Security from physical and electronic enemy intrusion conceals our capabilities and intentions, while allowing friendly forces the freedom to gather information on the adversary—the type of information that creates the opportunity to strike the enemy where least expected. By exploiting the vertical mediums of air and space, Airmen provide security for our nation and friendly forces by detecting enemy actions and determining intentions even in denied areas.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.7.5. Commanders have an obligation to protect their forces, but the threat and the means for countering it are quite different in contingency operations. The threat varies depending on local circumstances, but the commander must be aware that it always exists. Although U.S. forces have a right to self-defense, Airmen must bear in mind the concepts of necessity and proportionality when exercising that right (as discussed in the standing rules of engagement). <b class="calibre1">Necessity </b>exists when a hostile act occurs or when a force demonstrates hostile intent; use of force is then authorized while the force continues to commit hostile acts or exhibit hostile intent. <b class="calibre1">Proportionality </b>means the use of force should be sufficient to respond decisively, and may exceed the means and intensity of the hostile act/intent, but the nature, duration and scope of force should not exceed what is required.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.7.6. The concepts of necessity and proportionality as applicable to self-defense should not be confused with those of military necessity and proportionality as applicable in the law of armed conflict, which together seek to minimize collateral damage during offensive or defensive operations during armed conflict. Indeed, the defense of friendly forces against enemy attack during armed conflict would not (subject to prevailing rules of engagement) involve the concept of self-defense at all.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.8.<b class="calibre1"> Surprise leverages the principle of security by attacking the enemy at a time, place, or in a manner for which they are not prepared. </b>The speed and range of air, space, and cyberspace capabilities, coupled with their flexibility and versatility, allow air forces to achieve surprise more readily than other forces. The final choice of timing and tactics rests with the air component commander because terrain and distance are not inhibiting factors.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.8.1. Surprise is one of airpower’s strongest advantages. Operation EL DORADO CANYON (the U.S. raid on Libya) and the opening day of the air campaign during Operation DESERT STORM highlight examples where airpower achieved surprise.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.8.2. Airpower can enhance and empower other forces to achieve surprise as well. The rapid global reach of airpower can enable surface forces to reach foreign destinations quickly, thus seizing the initiative through surprise.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.3.9.<b class="calibre1"> Simplicity calls for avoiding unnecessary complexity in organizing, preparing, planning, and conducting military operations. </b>Simplicity ensures that guidance, plans, and orders are as simple and direct as the objective allows. Simple guidance allows subordinate commanders the freedom to operate creatively within their portion of the operational environment, supporting the concept of decentralized execution. Common equipment, a common understanding of Service and joint doctrine, and familiarity with procedures through joint exercises and training, can help overcome complexity. Straightforward plans, unambiguous organization, and clearly-defined command relationships are central to reducing complexity as well.</p>
	<p class="block_9">4.6.4. <b class="calibre1">Additional Principles of Operations.</b></p>
	<p class="block_8">In addition to the traditionally-held principles of war, an additional set of principles has been developed as a result of experience in contingency operations. These were first cast as “principles of military operations other than war” and later as “the political dimension of smaller-scale contingencies.” A distinguishing characteristic of such operations has been the degree to which political objectives influence operations and tactics. (Note that joint doctrine does not contain unity of effort as an additional principle.) These additional principles are:</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.4.1.<b class="calibre1"> Often the military is not the sole, or even the lead, agency in contingency operations. </b>Some operations are, by their nature, predominantly military. In most situations, however, the military will likely be one agency of many. As is especially common in stability operations, military forces often find themselves supporting the other instruments of national power. While unity of command is critical within the military forces, most of these operations demand unity of effort among a wide range of agencies to ensure that they coordinate their resources and focus on the same goal.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.4.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> Unity of effort becomes critical during interagency operations and can best be achieved through consensus building. </b>Whereas the main effort in military planning is on developing courses of action, the main effort in interagency planning should be to develop a shared, detailed understanding of the situation. This allows the various agencies to better understand how they can best apply their respective capabilities and measure success.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> Restraint is the disciplined application of military force appropriate to the situation. </b>Commanders should recognize that in some types of operations, use of more force than the minimum that is reasonably necessary (even though under or at the maximum permissible) may lead to escalation to a higher intensity conflict; could adversely affect efforts to gain or maintain legitimacy; and may impede the attainment of both short- and long-term goals.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.4.2.1. Air component commanders should begin developing a force structure by outlining the necessary capabilities needed for an operation and then follow up by deploying the appropriate “tailored” air, space, and cyberspace force mix. In order to maintain effective security while also exercising restraint, commanders should develop very clear rules on the use of force and rules of engagement. The rules of engagement for contingency operations are often more restrictive, detailed, and sensitive to political concerns than in sustained combat operations. Moreover, these rules may change frequently during operations. For all operations, Airmen should understand that restraint in the use of force is appropriate and more easily justified. However, restraint does not preclude the ability to use armed force, both lethal and nonlethal, when necessary in self-defense.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.6.4.3.<b class="calibre1"> The principle of perseverance encompasses the patient, resolute, and persistent pursuit of national goals and objectives, for as long as necessary to achieve them. </b>Some contingency operations involve a one-time occurrence or a short-term operation to maintain stability until local authorities can take over. Many missions, however, especially peace operations and building partner capacity, require a long-term commitment. The U.S. should be prepared to stay involved in a region for a protracted time in order to achieve its strategic goals. Complex problems often cannot be solved quickly; if a situation has been building for a long time, it may take the same amount of time or longer to resolve it. With this in mind, objectives should be established for the conditions under which forces may leave, rather than simply by a timetable for departure.</p>
	<p class="block_10">4.6.4.4.<b class="calibre1"> In order to reduce the threat to U.S. forces and to enable them to work toward their objective, the U.S. should be viewed as a legitimate actor in the mission, working towards multi-lateral interests including our own. </b>While legitimacy is principally generated by U.S. political leadership, legitimacy in the eyes of the host nation or target population could be affected more by the actions of the military. One key means of promoting legitimacy for certain types of contingency operations is through robust and effective military public affairs operations. Commanders should work closely with the host-nation government (if, in fact, there is one) at all levels to help preserve and foster the sense of legitimacy of mission.</p>
	<p class="block_7">4.7. Tenets of Airpower. </p>
	<p class="block_6">The application of airpower is refined by several fundamental guiding truths. These truths are known as tenets. They reflect not only the unique historical and doctrinal evolution of airpower, but also the current appreciation for the nature of airpower. The tenets of airpower complement the principles of joint operations. While the principles of war provide general guidance on the application of military forces, the tenets provide more specific considerations for the employment of airpower. The tenets of airpower are identified below. (<a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="text_1">Reference: Volume 1 – Basic Doctrine</a>)</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.7.1. <b class="calibre1">The tenet of centralized control and decentralized execution is critical to effective employment of airpower.</b> Indeed, they are the fundamental organizing principles for airpower, having been proven over decades of experience as the most effective and efficient means of employing it. This tenet enables the principle of mass while maintaining economy of force. Because of airpower’s unique potential to directly affect the strategic and operational levels of war, it should be controlled by a single Airman who maintains the broad, strategic perspective necessary to balance and prioritize the use of a powerful, highly desired yet limited force.<b class="calibre1"> </b>A single air component commander, focused on the broader aspects of an operation, can best balance or mediate urgent demands for tactical support against longer-term strategic and operational requirements. The ability to concentrate the air effort to fulfill the highest priorities for effects and to quickly shift the effort can only be accomplished through centralized control. On the other hand, the flexibility to take advantage of tactical opportunities and to effectively respond to shifting local circumstances can only be achieved through decentralized execution.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.7.1.1. This tenet is best appreciated as a general philosophy for the command and control of airpower. The construct of centralized control is an encapsulation of a hard-learned truth: that control of a valuable yet scarce resource (airpower) should be commanded by a single Airman, not parceled out and hardwired to subordinate surface echelons as it was prior to 1943. Tied to this fundamental truth is the recognition that no single Airman is capable of making all decisions, and should thus empower subordinates to respond in accordance with senior leader intent.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.7.1.2. Centralized control should be accomplished by an Airman at the functional component commander level who maintains a broad focus on the joint force commander’s objectives to direct, integrate, prioritize, plan, coordinate, and assess the use of air, space, and cyberspace assets across the range of military operations. Centralized control may be manifest at different levels within a combatant command depending on how the air component(s) is (are) organized and the nature of the supporting command and control architecture (functional or geographic). Also, due to the dynamics of the operational environment, control over some capabilities may, over time, shift up or down the command chain according to changes in priorities.</p>
	<p class="block_10">4.7.1.3. Centralized control empowers the air component commander to respond to changes in the operational environment and take advantage of fleeting opportunities, and embodies the tenet of flexibility and versatility.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Some would rather this be just “centralized planning and direction.” From an Airman’s perspective, “planning and directing” do not convey all aspects of control implied in “centralized control,” which maximizes the flexibility and effectiveness of airpower. Centralized control is thus pivotal to the determination of continuing advantage. However, it should not become a recipe for micromanagement, stifling the initiative subordinates need to deal with combat’s inevitable uncertainties. </p>
	<p class="block_10">4.7.1.4. Decentralized execution is defined as the “delegation of authority to designated lower-level commanders” and other tactical-level decision makers to achieve effective span of control and to foster disciplined initiative and tactical flexibility. It allows subordinates, all the way down to the tactical level, to exploit situational responsiveness and fleeting opportunities in rapidly changing, fluid situations. The benefits inherent in decentralized execution, however, are maximized only when a commander clearly communicates intent and subordinate commanders frame their actions accordingly.</p>
	<p class="block_10">4.7.1.5. Centralized control and decentralized execution of airpower provide broad global or theater-wide focus while allowing operational flexibility to meet military objectives. They assure concentration of effort while maintaining economy of force. They exploit airpower’s versatility and flexibility to ensure that it remains responsive, survivable, and sustainable.</p>
	<p class="block_10">4.7.1.6. Execution should be decentralized within a C2 architecture that exploits the ability of front-line decision makers (such as strike package leaders, air battle managers, forward air controllers) to make on-scene decisions during complex, rapidly unfolding operations. Modern communications technology may tempt commanders to take direct control of distant events and override the decisions of forward leaders, even when such control is not operationally warranted. This should be resisted at all costs in all functional components—not just air. Despite impressive gains in data exploitation and automated decision aids, a single person cannot, with confidence, achieve and maintain detailed situational awareness over individual missions when fighting a conflict involving many simultaneous engagements taking place throughout a large area, or over individual missions conducted in locally fluid and complex environments.</p>
	<p class="block_10">4.7.1.7. There may be some situations where there may be valid reasons for control of specific operations at higher levels, most notably when the JFC (or perhaps even higher authorities) may wish to control strategic effects, even at the sacrifice of tactical efficiency. However, such instances should be rare, as in the short notice prosecution of high-value, time-sensitive targets, or when the operational climate demands tighter control over selected missions due to political sensitivities, such as the potential for collateral damage or mistargeting, or in the case of nuclear employment. In all cases, senior commanders balance overall campaign execution against the pressing need for tactical effectiveness. As long as a subordinate’s decision supports the superior commander’s intent and meets campaign objectives, subordinates should be allowed to take the initiative during execution.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.7.2. Although often used interchangeably, flexibility and versatility are different.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.7.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Flexibility allows airpower to exploit mass and maneuver simultaneously. </b>Flexibility allows airpower to shift from one campaign objective to another, quickly and decisively; to “go downtown” on one sortie, then hit fielded enemy forces the next; to re-role assets quickly from a preplanned mission to support an unanticipated need for close air support of friendly troops in contact with enemy forces.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.7.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> Versatility is the ability to employ airpower effectively at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war and provide a wide variety of tasks in concert with other joint force elements. </b>Airpower has the potential to achieve this unmatched synergy through asymmetric and parallel operations. Space and cyberspace capabilities are especially able to simultaneously support multiple taskings around the globe and support tasks at all levels of warfare.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.7.3.<b class="calibre1"> Synergistic Effects. The proper application of a coordinated force across multiple domains can produce effects that exceed the contributions of forces employed individually. </b>The destruction of a large number of targets through attrition warfare is rarely the key objective in modern war. Instead, the objective is the precise, coordinated application of the various elements of airpower and surface power to bring disproportionate pressure on enemy leaders to comply with our national will (affecting their intent) or to cause functional defeat of the enemy forces (affecting their capability). Airpower’s ability to observe adversaries allows joint force commanders to counter enemy movements with unprecedented speed and agility. Airpower is unique in its ability to dictate the tempo and direction of an entire warfighting effort regardless of the scale of the operation.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.7.4. <b class="calibre1">Persistence. Air, space, and cyberspace operations may be conducted continuously against a broad spectrum of targets.</b> Airpower’s exceptional speed and range allow its forces to visit and revisit wide ranges of targets nearly at will.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Airpower does not have to occupy terrain or remain constantly in proximity to areas of operation to bring force upon targets. Space forces in particular hold the ultimate high ground, and as space systems continue to advance and proliferate, they offer the potential for persistent overhead access; unmanned aircraft systems offer similar possibilities from the atmosphere.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.7.4.1. Examples of persistent operations might be maintaining a continuous flow of materiel to peacetime distressed areas; Air Force intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities monitoring adversaries to ensure they cannot conduct actions counter to those agreed upon; assuring that targets are kept continually out of commission; or ensuring that resources and facilities are denied an enemy or provided to an ally during a specified time. The end result would be to deny the opponent an opportunity to seize the initiative and to directly accomplish assigned tasks.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.7.4.2. Factors such as enemy resilience, effective defenses, or environmental concerns may prevent commanders from quickly attaining their objectives. However, for many situations, airpower provides the most efficient and effective means to attain national objectives. Commanders must persist in the conduct of operations and resist pressures to divert resources to other efforts unless such diversions are vital to attaining theater goals or to survival of an element of the joint force. Given sufficient time, even the most devastating strategic effects can be circumvented by resourceful enemies; the goal is to keep pressure on and not allow the enemy that time.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.7.5. <b class="calibre1">Concentration. One of the most constant and important trends throughout military history has been the effort to concentrate overwhelming power at the decisive time and place.</b> The principles of mass and economy of force deal directly with concentrating overwhelming power at the right time and the right place (or places). The versatility of airpower with its lethality, speed, and persistence makes it an attractive option for many tasks. With capabilities as flexible and versatile as airpower, the demand for them often exceeds the available forces and may result in the fragmentation of the integrated airpower effort in attempts to fulfill the many demands of the operation. Depending on the operational situation, such a course of action may court the triple risk of failing to achieve operational-level objectives, delaying or diminishing the attainment of decisive effects, and increasing the attrition rate of air forces—and consequently risking defeat. Airmen should guard against the inadvertent dilution of airpower effects resulting from high demand.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.7.6.<b class="calibre1"> Priority. Commanders should establish clear priorities for the use of airpower. </b>Due to its inherent flexibility and versatility, the demands for airpower may likely exceed available resources. If commanders fail to establish priorities, they can become ineffective.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Commanders of all components need to effectively prioritize their requirements for coordinated airpower effects to the joint force commander, and only then can effective priorities for the use of airpower flow from an informed dialogue between the joint force commander and the air component commander. The air component commander should assess the possible uses of component forces and their strengths and capabilities to support the overall joint campaign. Limited resources require that airpower be applied where it can make the greatest contribution to the most critical current joint force commander requirements. The application of airpower should be balanced among its ability to conduct operations at all levels of war, often simultaneously. The principles of mass, offensive, and economy of force, the tenet of concentration, and the Airman’s strategic perspective all apply to prioritizing airpower.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.7.7. <b class="calibre1">Balance is an essential guideline for air commanders.</b> <b class="calibre1">Much of the skill of an air component commander is reflected in the dynamic and correct balancing of the principles of joint operations and the tenets of airpower to bring Air Force capabilities together to produce synergistic effects. </b>An air component commander should balance combat opportunity, necessity, effectiveness, efficiency, and the impact on accomplishing assigned objectives against the associated risk to friendly forces.</p>
	<p class="block_11">4.7.7.1. An Airman is uniquely—and best—suited to determine the proper theater-wide balance between offensive and defensive air operations, and among strategic, operational, and tactical applications. Air, space, and cyberspace assets are normally available only in finite numbers; thus, balance is a crucial determinant for an air component commander.</p>
	<p class="block_2"><span class="text_">Section 4C</span><b class="calibre1">—</b><span class="text_">Air Expeditionary Force</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">4.8. Air Expeditionary Force:</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.8.1. <b class="calibre1">AEF Concept.</b></p>
	<p class="block_8">The AEF concept provides forces and support on a rotational and relatively more predictable basis. The AEF ‘force generation’ construct establishes a predictable, standardized battle rhythm to ensure operational forces are organized, trained, equipped, and ready to respond to CCDRs’ requests for forces. Using a rotational capacity construct, deployed units undergo a period of dwell (i.e., time spent at home station) before entering another deployment/mobilization vulnerability period.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.8.2.<b class="calibre1"> Expeditionary Capabilities.</b></p>
	<p class="block_8">The Air Force relies on the AEF as a force management tool to sustain capabilities while rapidly responding to emerging crises. The Air Force supports global combatant commander requirements through a combination of assigned, attached (rotational), and mobility forces that may be forward deployed, transient, or operating from home station. There are four major elements of the AEF structure: readily available force, enabler force, in-place support, and institutional force. The first three elements are components that primarily constitute the Air Force‘s warfighting capability and are therefore postured in unit type codes.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.8.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Readily Available Force.</b> The readily available force is the primary pool from which the Air Force fulfills Global Force Management Allocation Plan requirements. To meet these requirements, the Air Force aligns its warfighting capabilities (i.e. forces from combat, combat support, and combat service support organizations) based on requirements relative to assigned rotational capabilities for each vulnerability period. </p>
	<p class="block_8">4.8.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> In-place Support.</b> <b class="calibre1">In-place Support.</b> There are two types of in-place support; forces that almost exclusively employ in direct support of a combatant commander mission, and those that represent the minimum number of requirements to support critical home station operations. In-place support forces are also included in the AEF Concepts.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.8.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Demand Force Team.</b> Demand Force Teams include user assets with a unique set of mission capabilities, such as global mobility forces, Special Operation Forces, personnel recovery forces, space forces, and other uniquely categorized forces that provide support to authorized organizations within and outside the Department of Defense. Most high demand/low supply assets, like these are postured as Demand Force Teams and will rotate as operational requirements dictate. Due to their unique nature, they cannot be easily aligned in AEF battle rhythm; however, every effort must be made to develop a sustainable plan by the Headquarters Air Force/major command functional area managers as a part of the enabler nomination request package.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.8.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Institutional Force.</b> The institutional force consists of those forces assigned to organizations responsible for Secretary of the Air Force directed Title 10 functions at the Air Force level (such as organize, train, equip, recruit, supply, etc.). Examples of these forces include: Military Training Instructors, technical school instructors, and personnel assigned to major commands and Headquarters staff. These organizations will not posture unit type codes in the unit type code availability, unless a waiver is granted by Headquarters Air Force. Although these organizations do not represent a war-fighting capability, the individuals assigned to these organizations are deployable.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.8.2.5.<b class="calibre1"> AEF Battle Rhythm.</b> The AEF operates on a 24-month life cycle. This cycle includes periods of normal training, preparation, and deployment vulnerability.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.8.2.5.1. For most forces, the majority of the AEF battle rhythm is spent in normal training during which forces concentrate on unit missions and basic proficiency events in accordance with applicable Air Force directives and Air Force Specialty Code requirements. This may include Joint, Air Force, or major command exercise participation such as Red Flag and Silver Flag. Most contingency and deployment training should take place during this period. This training and exercise period is also used to fill the unit's assigned/committed mission requirements, filling contingency requirements for 30 days or less and crisis response needs including humanitarian response operations and operational plans.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.8.2.5.2. Post-deployment reconstitution is included in this period. During the month immediately after deployment, the unit is focused on recovery. Permanent change of station or permanent change of assignment moves into and out of the unit will be de-conflicted to the maximum extent possible to occur during the <span class="calibre3">                </span>3-month period immediately after the vulnerability period.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.8.2.5.3. For forces aligned in the Enabler force, unit commanders should develop a deployment schedule that provides a measure of predictability to associated Airmen. However, operational requirements may force deviations from the applicable battle rhythm. Major command vice commanders will ensure appropriate mechanisms are in place to ensure Airmen postured as Enablers are provided a measure of predictability/stability</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.8.3.<b class="calibre1"> Global Force Management.</b></p>
	<p class="block_8">Global force management is the process the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff use to assign forces to combatant commander for mission accomplishment and allocate additional forces to combatant commanders in the event of contingency operations and apportion forces for combatant commander planning in the event contingency operations escalate. Global force management also provides senior decision makers a process to quickly and accurately assess the impact and risk of proposed changes in force assignment, apportionment, and allocation. </p>
	<p class="block_6">4.8.4.<b class="calibre1"> AEF Schedule.</b></p>
	<p class="block_8">The AEF schedule operates on two 12-month life cycles that align with the global force management cycle and coincide with fiscal years. Prior to the beginning of every AEF cycle, Air Force specialty functional area managers will revalidate the deployment to dwell period alignment of their respective capability areas and realign forces if necessary. The Air Force goal is that functional areas align to the least strenuous deployment to dwell baseline to minimize risk to the force. Every 12 months a new 24-month AEF schedule will be established</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.8.5. <b class="calibre1">AEF Teaming Construct.</b></p>
	<p class="block_8">The Air Force has transitioned to the AEF Teaming concept. This construct provides a better teaming concept through larger groupings of unit type codes from fewer units/bases in order to allow Airmen to deploy with their supervisors and members of their unit/base. This allows for shared common experiences throughout the deployment process. However, it should be noted, there will be no change to how the Air Force presents forces (air expeditionary task force (rotational), Component-major command-Numbered Air Force (in-place)).</p>
	<p class="block_12"> </p>
	<p class="block_7">4.9. Air Expeditionary Force Schedule and Posturing:</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.9.1.<b class="calibre1"> Posturing.</b></p>
	<p class="block_8">The basic building block used in force planning and the deployment of forces is the unit type code. A unit type code is a Joint Chiefs of Staff developed and assigned code, five-character alphanumeric designator uniquely identifying each type unit in the Armed Forces, and its force capability with personnel and/or equipment requirements. The assignment of a unit type code categorizes each type organization into a class or kind of unit having common distinguishing characteristics. All Air Force personnel contribute to the AEF and are inherently deployable or employable in-place. Those organizations identified as a Combat, Combat Support, or Combat Service Support or “war-fighting” organizations will posture unit type codes. Institutional organizations identified as “other” will not posture unit type codes. Posturing unit type codes is based on an organization’s funded military authorizations as shown in unit manpower document.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.9.1.1. AEF forces can be postured as forces <i class="calibre2">ready to deploy</i> to support combatant commander worldwide requirements, home station requirements, or reach back support to combatant commanders. This provides balanced war-fighting capabilities across the AEF Construct to support combatant commander requirements. With unit chain-of-command involvement and major command leadership and/or AEF cell oversight, major command functional area managers must determine which unit type codes to posture based on operational need, organizational specifics, and posturing codes within their functional area. Not all unit type codes will be postured, units may be tasked to support a unit type codes they have not postured as long as the unit can meet the unit type code’s mission capability statement.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.9.1.2. The various posturing codes (P-codes) indicate the number of unit type codes that are required for assigned/committed missions, critical home station requirements, and the number of unit type codes available to be simultaneously tasked for deployment.</p>

	<p class="block_8">4.9.2.1. All Airmen will be given an AEF indicator within 15-days of Date Arrive Station. For individuals assigned to readily available forces, their AEF indicator will correspond to the same AEF period as the unit’s unit type codes. For individuals assigned to the Institutional Force, the AEF indicator will correspond to an AEF vulnerability period determined by the Airman’s commander or equivalent. Except in cases of reaching forward, individuals will deploy during their associated AEF vulnerability period. Changing an individual’s AEF indicator will be done only under extenuating circumstances, along with permanent change of station or permanent change of assignment.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.9.2.2. AEF indicator Association Review. Prior to the start of each AEF Schedule, unit commanders will review AEF indicator codes of assigned Airmen to ensure they match unit type code alignment. In the case of the institutional force, organization commanders (or equivalent) will review AEF indicator codes to ensure equal distribution across the five vulnerability periods to the maximum extent possible while meeting the needs of the organization.</p>
	<p class="block_7">4.10. Deployment Planning Systems and Tools:</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.10.1. <b class="calibre1">Adaptive Planning and Execution System (APEX).</b> Joint operation planning occurs within a system of joint policies, procedures, and reporting structures known as APEX. APEX is supported by communications and information technology that is used by the joint planning and execution community to monitor, design, plan, execute, and assess mobilization, deployment, employment, sustainment, redeployment, and demobilization activities associated with joint operations. APEX formally integrates the planning activities of the joint planning and execution community and facilitates the seamless transition from planning to execution during times of crisis. APEX is the physical, virtual, and policy structure through which national strategic guidance is translated all the way down to levels used by the Air Force to plan and execute deployment activities. National strategic guidance proceeds through the following levels down to Air Force-specific guidance on deployment and support for the AEF.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.10.1.1. <b class="calibre1">National-Level Strategies</b>. The National Security Strategy<i class="calibre2"> </i>is prepared by the president for Congress, outlining our nation’s major security concerns and how the administration plans to address them using all instruments of national power (diplomatic, informational, and economic as well as military). The National Defense Strategy describes how the Department of Defense will support the objectives lined out in the National Security Strategy, as well as providing a framework for other Department of Defense guidance, specifically on deliberate planning, force development, and intelligence. The National Military Strategy provides the Chairman Joint Chief of Staff advice regarding the security environment; it also defines national-level military objectives (i.e., ends), how to accomplish these objectives (ways), and addresses the military capabilities required to execute the strategy (means). The Quadrennial Defense Review helps articulate the latest National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy by defining force structure, modernization plans, and budget plans.</p>
	<p class="block_13">4.10.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Unified Command Plan. </b>The Unified Command Plan establishes combatant command missions and responsibilities, addresses assignment of forces, delineates geographic areas of responsibility for geographic combatant commanders, and specifies responsibilities for functional combatant commanders.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.10.1.3. <b class="calibre1">Guidance for Employment of the Force. </b>The Guidance for Employment of the Force provides two-year direction to combatant commands for operational planning, force management, security cooperation, and posture planning. The Guidance for Employment of the Force is the method through which the Secretary of Defense translates strategic priorities in the National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy, and Quadrennial Defense Review into implementable direction for operational activities.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.10.1.4. <b class="calibre1">Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan. </b>The Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan is the primary vehicle through which the Joint Chiefs of Staff exercise responsibility for directing the preparation of joint plans. The Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan provides military strategic- and operational-level guidance to combatant commanders, Service Chiefs, combat support agencies, and applicable Department of Defense agencies for preparation of combatant commanders’ ongoing, steady-state campaign plans, as well as plans for specific contingencies or operations, <i class="calibre2">based on current military capabilities</i>. The Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan is the link between strategic guidance provided in the Guidance for Employment of the Force and joint operation planning activities and products that accomplish that guidance.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.10.2. <b class="calibre1">U.S. Air Force War and Mobilization Plan (WMP).</b> The WMP is the Air Force’s five-volume supporting document to the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan. The WMP volumes provide the Air Staff, planners, and commanders with current policies, planning factors, and Chairman Joint Chief of Staff-apportioned forces for conducting and supporting operations. The five volumes consist of:</p>
	<p class="block_10">4.10.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Volume 1, Basic Plan and Supporting Supplements (WMP-1)</b>, provides a consolidated reference source for general policies and guidance for mobilization planning and the support of combat forces in war and other operations.</p>
	<p class="block_10">4.10.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Volume 2, Plans Listing and Summary (WMP-2)</b>, is the single-source listing of all active plans with time-phased force and deployment data, or at least the Air Force portions of the time-phased force and deployment data). Part 1 lists all combatant commander plans required by the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan. Part 2 consists of the supporting plans written by component headquarters in support of Part 1, including the Air Force Service component.</p>
	<p class="block_10">4.10.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Volume 3, Combat and Support Forces (WMP-3)</b>, contains four parts: Part 1 lists combat forces. <i class="calibre2">When building the Air Force time-phased force and deployment data to accompany plans, component headquarters use only forces identified in Vol. 3, Part 1.</i> Part 2 lists the Air Force unit type code availability, containing all postured unit type code capability in the Air Force. Part 3 contains the Air Force Readiness Spares Package authorization document. Part 4 contains the capability annexes to the AEF Force Presence Policy, which describes how the Air Force makes its forces available through assignment, apportionment, and allocation to combatant commanders. </p>
	<p class="block_10">4.10.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Volume 4, Wartime Aircraft Activity (WMP-4)</b>, documents aircraft movement and operation by geographic location in plans, listed by current year (Part 1) and one year out (Part 2). It also provides guidance for and lists war reserve materiel, mission oriented items, and non-aircraft unit related ration requirements, again by location.</p>
	<p class="block_10">4.10.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Volume 5, Basic Planning Factors and Data (WMP-5)</b>, provides approved U.S. Air Force planning factors by aircraft type and theater, serving as a basis for establishing worldwide support for programmed force levels, based on aircraft apportioned in the WMP-3 in support of the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.10.3. The information contained in the WMP’s volumes provides the basis for Air Force component-level planning in support of combatant commanders’ theater and functional campaign plans. These specify strategies for the combatant commands’ steady-state, ongoing operations in support of national guidance. The WMP also supports deliberate planning for specific contingency operations, which are generally specific branches or sequels of combatant commanders’ campaign plans, and which may be developed into detailed “on-the-shelf” concept plans (with or without an Air Force time-phased force and deployment data) or operation plans. These concept plans and operation plans then often form the basis of crisis action planning for related contingencies. Such plans will contain tasking for the Air Force Service component as well as the joint or combined functional air component. Crisis action planning will further develop requirements into specific operation orders (such as warning, planning, alert, and execute orders) applicable to particular units. It is important to realize, however, that commanders and planners can “reach down” from any of the levels explained above and require base- or unit-level deployment planning (and sometimes execution)—from theater campaign plans all the ways down to crisis execution orders.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.10.4.<b class="calibre1"> Base Level Deployment Planning and Execution:</b></p>
	<p class="block_8">4.10.4.1.<b class="calibre1"> Force Presence. </b>All Air Force personnel contribute to the AEF. Air Force Personnel Center (or other designated force manager) supports AEF operations by identifying the most ready and available forces as part of unit type codes or as individuals to meet the stated requirement.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.10.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> Designed Operational Capabilities Statement.</b> Document prepared by a parent major command that consolidates reporting criteria and information based on Authoritative Data Sources requirements and Functional Manager inputs. The designed operational capabilities statement compiles Core Mission Essential Task List, War and Mobilization Plan, unit type code Availability and specific resources units are required to report. The designed operational capabilities statement ensures standards of reporting and to assist the units and commanders with gathering and reporting readiness data.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.10.4.3. <b class="calibre1">Mission Capability Statement.</b> A short paragraph describing the mission capabilities that higher headquarters planners expect of a specific unit type code. The statement usually contains pertinent information such as the type of base where commanders will deploy the unit, the unit's functional activities, and other augmentation requirements necessary to conduct specific missions.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.10.4.4. <b class="calibre1">Operation Plan.</b> An operation plan is any plan for the conduct of military operations prepared in response to actual or potential contingencies. They are based upon stated assumptions and are in the form of directive employed by higher authority to permit subordinate commanders to prepare supporting plans and orders. Combatant commanders create operation plans in response to strategic-level guidance and commanders of subordinate commands may also create them in response to requirements tasked by the establishing unified commander. Operation plans are prepared in either complete format, containing a full description of the concept of operations, all annexes applicable to the plan, and a time-phased force and deployment data, or as a concept plan, with or without a time-phased force and deployment data.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.10.4.5.<b class="calibre1"> Time Phased Force and Deployment Data. </b>When developing or executing plans, a time phased force and deployment data is the data base used to coordinate the movement of forces into their operational locations, almost like a baseball team’s batting order. The time-phased force and deployment data includes forces from all Services and their movement requirements. A time-phased force and deployment data contains critical information to include the time phasing of forces by C-Dates to specific destinations (called routing data). Additionally, through the use of unit type codes, this information includes personnel and equipment details. A time-phased force and deployment data is a deployment planning and execution tool containing live data that changes frequently. Time-phased force and deployment data provide a prioritized list of what unit type codes deploy in support of a particular plan, catalog combatant commander requirements, route forces, and establish transportation requirements. time-phased force and deployment data must be prioritized due to all Services competing for the movement assets.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.10.4.6.<b class="calibre1"> Installation Deployment Readiness Cell.</b> Centralized function aligned under the Logistic Readiness Squadron commander and located within the Logistic Readiness Squadron responsible for identifying, validating, and distributing deployment taskings and information. The installation deployment readiness cell is the day-to-day focal point for all deployment and execution operations. The permanent staff consists of the installation deployment officer, Logistic Readiness Squadron/Logistics Plans and Integration, and Force Support Squadron/Personnel Readiness Flight personnel. </p>
	<p class="block_8">4.10.4.7<b class="calibre1">. Installation Deployment Officer.</b> The designated military or federal civilian fully qualified logistics readiness officer that acts on behalf of the host installation/wing commander in directing, controlling, coordinating, and executing the deployment of in-place (home station) and aggregated contingency forces and installation deployment exercises (to include tenant units).

Installation Personnel Readiness responsibilities are covered in the following five categories: planning, global command and control system, accountability, deployment processing, and general.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.10.4.9.<b class="calibre1"> Unit Deployment Manager.</b> The Unit Deployment Manager is appointed by the unit commander to manage all deployment readiness and training aspects for deployable personnel and equipment within their unit to ensure they are deployment ready. In addition, unit deployment managers support redeployed personnel in the redeployment support process, and serve as the primary liaison to the unit training manager, flight/squadron leadership, wing training functions regarding deployment related issues, and installation deployment readiness cell.</p>

	<p class="block_8">4.10.4.10.1.<b class="calibre1"> Commander’s Toolkit. </b>Commander’s Toolkit is a nonsecure internet protocol router-net based system that provides information on deployment readiness, including individual medical readiness data at the unit level for commanders via the “Commander’s Toolkit” tab on every page of AEF Online (nonsecure internet protocol router). This tool was specifically built for base-level commanders, unit deployment managers, and other key staff, to monitor and manage the deployment status of their units and e-mail unit members with outstanding requirements directly from the tool.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.10.4.10.2.<b class="calibre1"> Personal Deployment Preparedness Tool. </b>The Personal Deployment Preparedness Tool provides personalized information at the individual level for all uniformed Airmen. The information provided includes; member’s duty status, security clearance, AEF Indicator, medical requirements (immunizations, medical equipment, deployment availability codes, dental status, preventive health assessment and laboratory requirements), and total force awareness training and Basic Airman Readiness, expeditionary skills proficiency pre-deployment training requirements extracted from the advanced distributed learning system.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.10.4.10.3.<b class="calibre1"> AEF Unit Type Code Reporting Tool.</b> AEF reporting tool measures AEF readiness at the unit type code level. Force providers are involved in AEF reporting tool reporting as AEF reporting tool monitors or as suppliers/receivers of AEF reporting tool reporting information. AFI 10-244, <i class="calibre2">Reporting Status of Aerospace Expeditionary Forces</i>, provides guideline for assessing and reporting unit type code capabilities, reporting guidelines, and details daily maintenance requirements. Through their unit AEF reporting tool monitors, commanders report the ability of a unit type code to perform its mission capability statement anywhere in the world at the time of the assessment. AEF reporting tool highlights missing resources and quantifies missing requirements for additional justification when submitting budgets.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.10.4.10.3.1. AEF reporting tool is the only assessment system that reports at the unit type code level and is the primary system used to source unit type codes for taskings and contingencies. Commanders ensure AEF reporting tool is accurate and up-to-date. Inaccurate AEF reporting tool reporting leads to taskings that exceed capability, shortfalls/reclamas, delays in filling combatant commander requirements, and Airmen receiving short-notice taskings.</p>
	<p class="block_19">4.10.4.10.3.2. Commanders conduct two types of unit type code assessments in AEF reporting tool: Readiness Assessments and Tasking Assessments. Readiness stoplight assessments (Green, Yellow, or Red) indicate whether a unit type code can perform its mission capability statement anywhere in the world at the time of the assessment. To report accurately, commanders and unit AEF reporting tool Monitors, who may also be the unit deployment manager, must know their unit type codes requirements and the status of their personnel and equipment and actions required to bring all unit type codes to “Green”.</p>
	<p class="block_2"><span class="text_">Section 4D</span><b class="calibre1">—</b><span class="text_">The Joint Force</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">4.11. Introduction.</p>
	<p class="block_6">This section assists Airmen to successfully operate as members of a joint team. Specifically, this section discusses the foundations of joint doctrine, characterizes doctrine governing unified direction of armed forces, outlines the functions of the Department of Defense and its major components, describes the fundamental principles for joint command and control, details doctrine for joint commands, describes joint planning, provides guidance for multinational operations.</p>
	<p class="block_7">4.12. Foundations of Joint Doctrine.</p>
	<p class="block_6">Joint doctrine promotes a common perspective from which to plan, train, and conduct military operations. The foundations of joint doctrine represents what is taught, believed, and advocated as what is right (that is, what works best). U.S. military service is based on values that U.S. military experience has proven to be vital for operational success.</p>
	<p class="block_20">4.13. Fundamental Principles for Joint Command and Control:</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.13.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Unity of command means all forces operate under a single commander with the requisite authority to direct all forces employed in pursuit of a common purpose. Unity of effort, however, requires coordination and cooperation among all forces toward a commonly recognized objective, although they are not necessarily part of the same command structure.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.13.2. The President and the Secretary of Defense exercise authority, direction and control of the Armed Forces through two distinct branches of the chain of command and control. The operational branch, used for executing missions, runs from the President, through the Secretary of Defense to the combatant commander. The operational branch includes the following types of command authorities:</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.13.2.1. Combatant command authority is the authority of a combatant commander to perform those functions of command over assigned forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations, joint training (or in the case of U.S. special operations command, training of assigned forces), and logistics necessary to accomplish the missions assigned to the command. It cannot be delegated or transferred.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.13.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Operational control is the command authority that may be exercised by commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command and may be delegated within the command. Operational control is inherent in combatant command and is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the command; it does not include authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.13.2.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Tactical control is the command authority over assigned or attached forces or commands, or military capability or forces made available for tasking that is limited to the detailed direction and control of movements or maneuvers within the operational area necessary to accomplish assigned missions or tasks. Tactical control is inherent in operational control and may be delegated to and exercised by commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.13.2.4. A support relationship is established by a superior commander between subordinate commanders when one organization should aid, protect, complement, or sustain another force. Support may be exercised by commanders at any echelon at or below the combatant command level. This includes the Secretary of Defense designating a support relationship between combatant commanders as well as within a combatant command. The designation of supporting relationships is important as it conveys priorities to commanders and staffs that are planning or executing joint operations. The support command relationship is, by design, a somewhat vague but very flexible arrangement. The establishing authority (the common superior commander) is responsible for ensuring that both the supported commander and supporting commanders understand the degree of authority that the supported commander is granted.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.13.3<b class="calibre1">.</b> The administrative branch of the chain of command, from the President through the Secretary of Defense to the Secretaries of the military departments to the service chiefs, provides the authority for the Secretary of the military department to accomplish those functions and responsibilities of administration and support described in 10 United States Code.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.13.3.1. Administrative control is direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or other organizations in respect to administration and support, including organization of service forces, control of resources and equipment, personnel management, unit logistics, individual and unit training, readiness, mobilization, demobilization, discipline, and other matters not included in the operational missions of the subordinate or other organizations.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.13.3.2. Administrative control is a service command authority, and flows through service, not joint, channels. This authority is not an operational command authority but provides the requisite authority for Services to execute their individual “organize, train, and equip” functions.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.13.4. All National Guard and Reserve forces (except those specifically exempted) are assigned by the Secretary of Defense to the combatant commands. However, those forces are available for operational missions only when mobilized for specific periods, by law, or when ordered to active duty after being validated for employment by their parent service.</p>
	<p class="block_7">4.14. Joint Force Organization:</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.14.1. Joint forces are established at three levels: unified commands, subordinate unified commands, and joint task forces, and can be established on either a geographic area or functional basis (Figure 4.2). These organizations are commanded by a joint force commander. A joint force commander is a general term applied to a combatant commander, subunified commander, or joint force commander authorized to exercise combatant command (command authority) or operational control over a joint force.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.14.1.1. A unified command is a command with broad continuing missions under a single commander, composed of forces from two or more military departments, and established by the President, through the Secretary of Defense, with the advice and assistance of the Chairman, Joint Chief of Staff.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.14.1.2. A specified command is a command that has broad continuing missions and is established by the President, through the Secretary of Defense, with the advice and assistance of the Chairman, Joint Chief of Staff. Currently, there are no specified commands designated.</p>

	<p class="block_24">4.14.1.3. When authorized by the Secretary of Defense through the Chairman, Joint Chief of Staff, commanders of unified commands may establish subordinate unified commands to conduct operations on a continuing basis using the criteria set forth for unified commands.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.14.1.4. A joint task force is a joint force that is constituted and so designated by the Secretary of Defense, a combatant commander, a subordinate unified commander, or an existing joint task force commander. A joint task force may be established on a geographical area or functional basis when the mission has a specific limited objective and does not require overall centralized control of logistics.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.14.2. The key to successful employment of Air Force forces as part of a joint force effort is providing a single Air Force commander with the responsibility and authority to properly organize, train, equip and employ Air Force forces to accomplish assigned functions and tasks. The title of this commander is Commander, Air Force Forces. Operationally, the Commander, Air Force Forces should be prepared to employ Air Force forces as directed by the joint force commander, and if directed be prepared to employ joint air forces as the joint force air component commander. In either event, the Commander, Air Force Forces should also ensure that Air Force forces are prepared to execute the missions assigned by the joint force commander. The requirements and responsibilities of the COMAFFOR and joint force air component commander are inextricably linked; both are critical to operational success.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.14.2.1. Although all Air Force units, regardless of level, have an Air Force commander, the title of Commander, Air Force Forces is reserved exclusively to the single Air Force commander of an Air Force Service component assigned or attached to a joint force commander at the unified combatant command, subordinate unified command, or joint task force level. The Secretary of Defense/combatant commander may elect to permanently establish a subordinate unified command or temporarily establish a subordinate joint task force as part of his/her organizational structure. The commanders of these subordinate joint forces are, by joint and Air Force doctrine, joint force commanders at a lower level than the combatant commander. If Air Force forces are assigned or attached to subordinate joint force commanders, that action creates an Air Force Service component with a separate Commander, Air Force Forces directly responsible to the appropriate joint force commander.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.14.2.2. The Commander, Air Force Forces should normally be designated at a command level above the operating forces and should not be dual-hatted as commander of one of the subordinate operating units. This allows the Commander, Air Force Forces to focus at the operational level of war, while subordinate commanders lead their units at the tactical level.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.14.2.3. The Commander, Air Force Forces commands the Air Force Service component to the joint force commander. At the combatant command or subordinate unified command level this is normally a standing permanently assigned organization. At the joint task force level the Air Force Service component will normally be an air expeditionary task force. At whatever level, the Air Force Service component <span class="calibre3">  presents a joint force commander with a task-organized, integrated package with the appropriate balance of force, sustainment, control, and force protection. </span>Every Air Force Service component presents a scalable, tailorable organization with three elements: a single commander, embodied in the Commander, Air Force Forces; appropriate command and control mechanisms; and tailored and fully supported forces.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.14.2.4. The air expeditionary task force will be tailored to the mission; this includes not only forces, but also the ability to command and control those forces for the missions assigned. When forming an air expeditionary task force, the Commander, Air Force Forces should draw first from in-theater resources, if available. If augmentation is needed, or if in-theater forces are not available, the Air Force will draw as needed from the AEF currently on rotation. These forces, whether in-theater or deployed from out of theater, should be fully supported with the requisite maintenance, logistical support, health services, and administrative elements. These forces will form up within the air expeditionary task force as expeditionary wings, groups, squadrons, flights, detachments, or elements, as necessary to provide reasonable spans of control and command elements at appropriate levels and to provide unit identity.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.14.2.5. Air expeditionary task force command and control mechanisms are in place and are usually known as an air operations center. An air operations center may be regional or functional, aligning with the purpose of the unified command they support. The Commander, Air Force Forces requires command activities as tools to assist in exercising operational control, tactical control, and administrative control. The Commander, Air Force Forces uses an air operations center to exercise control of air and space operations, and a service component staff (commonly called the Air Force forces staff) to exercise support operations and administrative control. The character of the operations center may vary, depending on the nature of the forces. For air mobility operations, the operations center may be the 618th Air Operations Center (formerly the Tanker Airlift Control Center) at Scott Air Force Base, while space operations would leverage the 614th Air Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.14.2.6. An air expeditionary task force also needs a command entity responsible for the deployment and sustainment of Air Force forces. The Air Force forces staff is the mechanism through which the Commander, Air Force Forces exercises service responsibilities. These sustainment activities are sometimes referred to as “beds, beans, and bullets.” The Air Force forces staff is also responsible for the long-range planning and theater engagement operations that fall outside the air operation center’s current operational focus.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.14.2.7. The core capabilities of the air operations center and Air Force forces staff should be well-established, but tailored in size and function according to the theater and the operation. Not all operations require a full-up air operations center with over 1,000 people or a large Air Force forces staff. Smaller operations, such as some humanitarian operations, can make do with a small control center that does little more than scheduling and reporting.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.14.3. Combatant commanders and commanders of subordinate unified commands and joint task force commanders have the authority to establish functional component commands to control military operations (Figure 4.3). Joint force commanders may decide to establish a functional component command to integrate planning; reduce their span of control; and/or significantly improve combat efficiency, information flow, unity of effort, weapon systems management, component interaction, and control over the scheme of maneuver.</p>

	<p class="block_10">4.14.3.1. If air assets from more than one service are present within a joint force, the joint force commander normally will designate a joint force air component commander to exploit the full capabilities of joint air operations. The a joint force air component commander should be the service component commander with the preponderance of air capabilities and the ability to plan, task, and control joint air operations. If working with allies in a coalition or alliance operation, the joint force air component commander may be designated as the combined force air component commander. Both joint and U.S. Air Force doctrine state that one individual will normally be dual-hatted as commander, Air Force forces and a joint force air component commander/combined force air component commander. The U.S. Air Force prefers<b class="calibre1">—</b>and in fact, plans and trains<b class="calibre1">—</b>to employ through a commander, Air Force forces who is then prepared to assume responsibilities as aa joint force air component commander if so designated. The joint force air component commander recommends the proper employment of air forces from multiple components. The a joint force air component commander also plans, coordinates, allocates tasks, executes, and assesses air and space operations to accomplish assigned operational missions. Because of the wide scope of air operations, the joint force air component commander will typically maintain the same joint operating area/theater-wide perspective as the joint force commander. The joint force air component commander, as with any component commander, should not also be dual-hatted as the joint force commander.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.14.3.2. Functional component commanders normally exercise tactical control of forces made available to them by the joint force commander. Thus, a Commander, Air Force Forces exercises operational control of Air Force forces and, acting as a joint force air component commander, normally exercises tactical control of any Navy, Army, Marine, and coalition air assets made available for tasking (i.e., those forces not retained for their own service’s organic operations).</p>

	<p class="block_7">4.15. Joint Operation Planning.</p>
	<p class="block_6">Joint operation planning consists of planning activities associated with joint military operations by combatant commanders and their subordinate joint force commanders in response to contingencies and crises. Joint operation planning transforms national strategic objectives into activities by development of operational products that include planning for the mobilization, deployment, employment, sustainment, redeployment, and demobilization of joint forces. Furthermore, joint operation planning ties the military instrument of national power to the achievement of national security goals and objectives and is essential to securing strategic end states across the range of military operations. Planning begins with the end state in mind, providing a unifying purpose around which actions and resources are focused.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.15.1. Joint operation planning provides a common basis for discussion, understanding, and change for the joint force, its subordinate and higher headquarters, the joint planning and execution community, and the national leadership. The APEX system facilitates iterative dialogue and collaborative planning between the multiple echelons of command to ensure that the military instrument of national power is employed in accordance with national priorities, and that the plan is continuously reviewed and updated as required and adapted according to changes in strategic guidance, resources, or the operational environment. Joint operation planning also identifies capabilities outside Department of Defense required for achieving the strategic objectives to reach the end state by providing a forum that facilitates the inter-organizational coordination that enables unified action.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.15.2. The APEX system operates in a networked, collaborative environment, which facilitates dialogue among senior leaders, concurrent and parallel plan development, and collaboration across multiple planning levels. The joint planning and execution community uses the APEX system to monitor, plan, and execute mobilization, deployment, employment, sustainment, redeployment, and demobilization activities associated with joint operations. Clear strategic guidance and frequent interaction between senior leaders and planners promote early understanding of, and agreement on, planning assumptions, considerations, risks, and other key factors.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.15.3. In peacetime, combatant commanders develop campaign plans to delineate their strategies for ongoing, steady-state operations intended to deliver continuing strategic advantage to the U.S. and its allies. Planners develop branch and sequel plans to these campaign plans to cover particular potential contingencies within their areas of responsibility. These contingency plans can be elaborated into one of four levels of detail, each with characteristic planning products:</p>
	<p class="block_13">4.15.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Commander’s Estimate</b>. Produces multiple potential courses of action to address the contingency and complete the mission. It contains the supported commander’s evaluation of the potential courses of action along with a recommended courses of action.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.15.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Base Plan</b>. This describes a concept of operations that addresses the contingency, based on a selected course of action. It identifies major forces involved, the concept of support, and anticipated timelines for completing the mission (often expressed in “lines of effort”). It normally does not contain annexes or time-phased force deployment data.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.15.3.3. <b class="calibre1">Concept of Plan</b>. This is an operation plan in abbreviated format. It normally includes a plan summary, a base plan, and several crucial annexes (such as those delineating command relations and interagency coordination requirements.). It may or may not include a time-phased force deployment data.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.15.3.4. <b class="calibre1">Operation Plan</b>. A complete and detailed joint plan containing a comprehensive description of the concept of operations, including identification of specific forces, functional support, and resources required; all annexes applicable to the plan; and a time-phased force deployment data. It can be quickly developed in to an operation order.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.15.4. In a crisis, the joint planning and execution community employs combat air patrol to accomplish planning in a time-sensitive manner, producing orders that describe the mission, situation, and objectives; establish command relationships; identify planning assumptions; and identify and/or task forces and strategic mobility resources, or request them. The types of joint operation orders are:</p>
	<p class="block_10">4.15.4.1. <b class="calibre1">Warning Order</b>. Initiates development and evaluation of course of actions by supported commander. Requests commander’s estimate.</p>
	<p class="block_10">4.15.4.2. <b class="calibre1">Planning Order</b>. Begins execution planning for a particular course of action. Directs preparation of an operation order or contingency plan. Conveys anticipated course of action selection by the President or Secretary of Defense. </p>
	<p class="block_10">4.15.4.3. <b class="calibre1">Alert Order</b>. Begins execution planning for a selected course of action, directing preparation of and operation order or contingency plan. Conveys course of action selection by the President or Secretary of Defense.</p>
	<p class="block_10">4.15.4.4. <b class="calibre1">Prepare to Deploy Order</b>. Increases or decreases deployability posture of units.</p>
	<p class="block_10">4.15.4.5. <b class="calibre1">Deployment (or Redeployment) Order</b>. Deploys or redeploys forces, increases deployability posture, establishes a joint task force, and/or establishes a C-day/L-hour (day or hour on which the deployment operation commences).</p>
	<p class="block_10">4.15.4.6. <b class="calibre1">Execute Order</b>. Implements the President’s or Secretary of Defense’s decision to execute a course of action or operation order.</p>
	<p class="block_10">4.15.4.7. <b class="calibre1">Operation Order</b>. Directs the coordinated execution of an operation. Issued by a commander to subordinate commanders.</p>
	<p class="block_10">4.15.4.8. <b class="calibre1">Fragmentary Order</b>. Issued as needed to change or modify an operation order execution.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.15.5. Planning is conducted at every echelon of command and across the range of military operations. Joint operation planning employs an integrated process for orderly analytical, and coordinated problem solving and decision-making known as the joint operation planning process. In its peacetime application, the process is highly structured to support the thorough and fully coordinated development of deliberate plans. In crisis, the process can be shortened as needed to support the dynamic requirements of changing events. In wartime, the process adapts to accommodate greater decentralization of joint operation planning activities. Joint operation planning process consists of a set of logical steps to examine a mission; develop, analyze, and compare alternative course of actions, select the best course of action<span class="calibre3">, develop a concept of operations, and produce a plan or order.  </span><b class="calibre1">Joint operation planning process is thus the process used to derive all the types of plans—and many of the orders—described above.</b> <b class="calibre1">Joint operation planning process is also the process used to derive subordinate plans for employment and support of forces, including those created for use by Air Force forces. </b>Joint operation planning process consists of seven steps:</p>
	<p class="block_13">4.15.5.1. <b class="calibre1">Planning Initiation</b>. An appropriate authority (such as the President, Secretary of Defense, or combatant commander) recognizes potential for employing military capability in a particular contingency or crisis and decides to develop military options.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.15.5.2. <b class="calibre1">Mission Analysis</b>. A crucial output of this step is the mission statement: The joint force’s mission is the task, or set of tasks, together with the purpose, that indicates the action to be taken and the reason for doing so. Key mission analysis activities include such things as review of initial planning guidance and intelligence; developing the mission statement; determining known facts and developing planning assumptions; conducting an initial force allocation review; and developing mission success criteria (measures of effectiveness for the mission). Mission analysis concludes with a mission analysis brief to the commander and involves approval of the mission statement.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.15.5.3. <b class="calibre1">Course of Action Development</b>. A course of action is a potential way (solution, method) to accomplish the assigned mission. Staffs develop course of actions to provide unique choices to the commander, all oriented on accomplishing the military end state. course of actions describe <i class="calibre2">who</i> will take action, <i class="calibre2">what type</i> of military action will take place, <i class="calibre2">when </i>the action will occur, <i class="calibre2">where</i> the action will occur, <i class="calibre2">why </i>the action is required (the purpose), and <i class="calibre2">how </i>the action will take place (the method of employment of forces). Each course of action should explain the objectives, end state, key tasks, and task organization.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.15.5.4. <b class="calibre1">Course of Action Analysis</b>. This step closely examines potential course of action<span class="calibre3">s to reveal details that will allow the commander and staff to evaluate them in order to identify advantages and disadvantages.  The primary means of conducting this analysis is wargaming. Wargaming is a conscious effort to visualize the flow of an operation, given friendly and adversary dispositions, capabilities, strengths, and possible </span>course of actions. A critical element of wargaming is the “red team/cell,” which role-plays and models the adversary, aggressively pursuing the adversary’s point of view and objectives. Wargaming can be as simple as a turn-by-turn table-top affair, or as complex as a Department of Defense-adjudicated game hosted on mainframe computers. Wargaming allows the planning staff and commander to asses each course of action for feasibility—to answer questions like, “can it be supported?” “Is more combat capability need?” “Can the adversary effectively counter or prevent friendly action?” The outputs of this step feed the next:</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.15.5.5. <b class="calibre1">Course of Action Comparison</b>. Comparison is a subjective process whereby the course of action are independently evaluated against a set of criteria established by the commander and staff. This step should identify and recommend the course of action that has the greatest probability of success against the adversary course of action that is of most concern to the commander. Often, the staff develops an evaluation matrix that compares all the friendly course of action against the established set of criteria; this may help identify the best course of action. Ultimately, the staff develops a brief recommending their selection for “best” course of action.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.15.5.6. <b class="calibre1">Course of Action Approval</b><span class="calibre3">. In this step, the staff briefs the commander on the course of action comparison and wargaming results and recommends a course of action for approval.  The commander may approve the course of action or modify it, or direct the staff to reiterate portions of the </span>joint operation planning process<span class="calibre3">.  From the final course of action selection, the commander and staff prepare a commander’s estimate (previously described) and direct further plan or order development.</span></p>
	<p class="block_8">4.15.5.7. <b class="calibre1">Plan or Order Development</b>. The commander’s staff and subordinate functional or Service component staffs develop more detailed plans, supporting plans, or orders, as required by the mission (and as described above).</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.15.6. For further information concerning the joint force and planning, see Joint Publication 5-0, <i class="calibre2">Joint Operation Planning.</i></p>
	<p class="block_6">4.15.7.<span class="calibre3"> Subordinate and supporting commands and staffs use the JOPP process to create their own plans and orders.  </span><b class="calibre1">When the Air Force Service component or the joint force air component accomplish this process, it is known as the joint operation planning process for air</b>. When the joint force air component accomplishes the joint operation planning process for air, it produces a plan known as the joint air operations plan, or joint air operations plan<span class="calibre3">.  During execution, the </span>joint air operations plan<span class="calibre3"> is divided into time-defined (usually daily) “slices” known as air operation directives.  A</span>ir operation directives, then, are the basis for the daily air tasking orders, which govern accomplishment of the air tasking and targeting cycles—the mechanisms of joint air employment of forces. Following execution, these cycles guide the staffs and commander through assessment of operations: “Are we doing the right things and are we doing things right in order to accomplish the mission?” “What is our progress toward accomplishment?” The Air Force Service component produces an Air Force Service component plan to support the joint force air component and the joint force overall. Most all of the planning described in this paragraph takes place in the air operations center, or air operation center<span class="calibre3">, although some Service component planning may take place elsewhere.  For more information on Air Force and air component planning, see Air Force Doctrine Annex 3-0, </span><i class="calibre2">Operations and Planning</i>.</p>

	<p class="block_20">4.16. Joint and Coalition Capabilities:</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.16.1. As our Nation and armed forces are confronted with a multitude of priorities, from a shrinking force and limited resources, to fiscal constraints, we must be mindful to advance only the necessary resources to ensure that the right capabilities are integrated and interoperable across all domains of air, space, and cyberspace. Competing priorities today must now be carefully measured against all military capabilities, ensuring that quality—not necessarily quantity—smartly contributes to a faster, more flexible, agile and response force. That said, we must rely on the strengths of others, or be interdependent, and meanwhile ensure all capabilities can effectively intertwine, or be interoperable with each other to achieve an overarching objective. One of the founding initiatives, which addressed joint interdependence and joint interoperability, was the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.16.2. One of the first successful operational actions of combining joint and coalition integration was experienced during Operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM. These operations demonstrated an unmistakable fashion the value and effectiveness of joint and combined military operations. The unique capabilities of each of the U.S. military Services, and those of each of our allies, were exploited during various phases of both operations. The combined force provided a synergistic combat capability which brought the greatest possible military power of the coalition force to bear against the opponent. Likewise, our experience also reaffirmed the importance of joint and combined training, the value of forward presence and the validity of joint force sequencing for power-projection. A good example of this was through the use of the Air Force’s domain of space. After the Gulf War there was a near unanimous agreement that space-based systems greatly increased the overall effectiveness of coalition forces.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.16.3. Clearly, history proved that collectively, the strengths, resources, and training of one Service or nation in today’s increasingly complex environment, increases and/or balances the successful outcome of a military objective. This was seen in Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan…throughout all aspects of the global war on terrorism and through other worldwide security challenges.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.16.4. The U.S. Air Force’s unity of effort, through the application of air, space, and cyberspace, provides unique capabilities that bridge a comprehensive joint and coalition approach. This unity of effort involves the coordination and cooperation toward common objectives, even if the participants are not necessarily part of the same command or organization, but the product of successful unified action (Joint Publication 1-02).</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.16.5. Our doctrine continues to evolve; we now rarely see any one Service or any one country unilaterally plan, organize, or execute an operation, but we see inclusiveness with joint, coalition, and sometimes interagency partners, whereby we depend on each other to succeed in today’s complex environment. Through this interdependence we are able to select the right resources and capabilities from each other. These capabilities simply do not get used when a contingency arises, but are synergized and tested through such venues as exercises and operations to ensure all joint, and when necessary, coalition partners can meet the desired objectives at the right time and right place.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.16.6. Each Service and coalition brings a unique balance to every operation and, depending upon the circumstances, the balance may shift from one Service or nation due to the different operating environments and applications necessary to support the best options. Our Air Force tenet of centralized control, decentralized execution is a great example of this. When employing strategic air attack as a line of operations, which defines the interior or exterior orientation of the force in relation to the enemy or that connects actions on nodes and/or decisive points related in time and space to an objective, we will require a high degree of centralization under an air commander, known as the joint force air component commander. The joint force air component commander must have authority over all forces, foreign or domestic, to direct operations, including attack sequencing and make adjustments as operations unfold. On the contrary, if tactical air operations are necessary to support ground troops using close air support, these air resources are best when decentralized to support ground commanders. The tenet of Airpower is never prosecuted alone, but space and cyberspace, which belongs to no one state, remains a vital imperative for joint force operations.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.16.7. A good example of this was played out during Operation ODYSSEY DAWN over Libya in 2011. During this operation, the joint and combined operations provided one of the greatest uses of joint and coalition capabilities in our recent history. In an effort to support multi-national efforts necessary to protect civilians in Libya from attacks by the regime of Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi, the U.S. Africa Command task force was assigned to provide operational and tactical command and control of U.S. military forces supporting the international response to the unrest in Libya and enforcement of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. At the start of operations, U.S. Africa Command, commanded by General Carter Ham, exercised strategic command. Tactical command in the theater of operations was executed from USS <i class="calibre2">Mount Whitney </i>in the Mediterranean Sea under supported command of Admiral Sam Locklear, Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Africa. U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates indicated that control of the operation would be transferred to French and British authorities, or North Atlantic Treaty Organization, within days. The Joint Task Force was called Joint Task Force ODYSSEY DAWN.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.16.8. As a joint team, the supporting commands (commanders) were the Joint Force Maritime Component Commander Vice Admiral Harry B. Harris who controlled maritime assets aboard the USS <i class="calibre2">Mount Whitney,</i> and Joint Force Air Component Commander Major General Margaret Woodward.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.16.9. As the Libyans began joining other Arab populations across North Africa in conducting antigovernment protests and demonstrations, time passed and the Qadhafi regime increasingly began to use military force against its citizens in efforts to repress the uprising. The Arab League meeting in Cairo asked the United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Libya to protect civilians from air attack and declaring that the Qadhafi government had lost its sovereignty. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1973 authorizing all necessary measures to protect civilians in Libya. The resolution authorized the use of force and the enforcement of a no-fly zone over Libya. The U.S. Secretary of Defense approved and ordered the use of U.S. military forces in strikes against the government of Libya. The International Coalition took measures to begin enforcement of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, to include the imposition of a no-fly zone, launched strikes against Libyan military sites and air defense systems.</p>
	<p class="block_6">4.16.10. To illustrate effective interdependence and interoperability, the following joint and coalition capabilities over Libya was a good example. The following representation was captured within the first few days of Operation<span class="text_8"> </span>ODYSSEY DAWN:</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.16.10.1. As Major General Woodward commanded the air campaign, French aircraft destroyed four Libyan tanks in air strikes to the southwest of the city of Benghazi. The French military claimed that its aircraft had also flown reconnaissance missions over all Libyan territory. On the same day, British Prime Minister David Cameron confirmed that Royal Air Force jets were also in action and reports suggested that the U.S. Navy had fired the first cruise missile. CBS News correspondent David Martin reported that three B-2 stealth bombers from Whiteman Air Force base Missouri flew nonstop from the U.S. to drop 40 bombs on a major Libyan airfield. Martin further reported that U.S. fighter jets were searching for Libyan ground forces to attack. The Pentagon and the British Ministry of Defense confirmed that, jointly, British ship HMS <i class="calibre2">Triumph </i>and U.S. Navy ships (including USS <i class="calibre2">Barry</i>) and submarines fired more than 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles, supported with air attacks on military installations, both inland and on the coast. Days later, several Storm Shadow missiles were launched by British jets. Nineteen U.S. planes conducted strike operations in Libya. The planes included Marine Corps AV-8B Harriers, U.S. Navy EA-18G Growlers, which were diverted from operations over Iraq and jammed Libyan radar and communications, and Air Force F-15 and F-16 fighter jets. A military convoy was destroyed south of Benghazi by air strikes. Seventy military vehicles were destroyed and multiple loyalist ground troop casualties were also reported. Four Danish F-16 fighters left Italy’s Sigonella Air Base for a successful 5-hour long high-risk mission, and four Italian Tornados (electronic combat/reconnaissance), accompanied by four Italian aircraft. Operations continued and on 31 March 2011 at 0600 Greenwich Mean Time, North Atlantic Treaty Organization took command of all operations in Libya with subsequent operations being conducted as part of North Atlantic Treaty Organization-driven operation unified protector.</p>
	<p class="block_8">4.16.10.2. Operation ODYSSEY DAWN was a complete success and supported the necessity of, not only joint and coalition capabilities, but how air, space, and cyberspace domains intertwined all facets of the operation to guarantee success. General Dempsey said it best when he stated [Joint and Coalition] <span class="text_">“means building and presenting forces that can be molded to context—not just by adding and subtracting, but by leaders combining capabilities in innovative ways. It means interdependence services that rely on each other to achieve objectives and create capabilities that do not exist except when combined. It means a regionally postured, but globally networked and flexible force that can be scaled and scoped to demand.”</span></p>
	<p class="block_45">4.16.11. Today, not one military contingency or operation, whether in peacetime or wartime, can optimize its objective without space or cyberspace. Airpower offers speed, agility, flexibility, range, and responsiveness to virtually every need, and airpower has demonstrated its success to meet our homeland and international security challenges by leveraging our respective capabilities and maximizing resulting synergy. Cyber operations guarantee our capability to operate in any contested cyber domain to support vital land, sea, air, and space missions by developing capabilities to protect essential military cyber systems and to speed their recovery if an attack does occur. In these interdependent domains the Air Force possesses unique capabilities for ensuring global mobility, long-range strike, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The benefits of airpower extend beyond the air domain, and operations among the air, land, maritime, space, and cyber domains are increasingly interdependent upon each other for the success of any and all national military objectives. Together, the domains of air, space, and cyberspace, effectively combined with joint and coalition capabilities, has proven to be the most valuable means of supporting the National Security Strategy of the U.S. and our allies.</p>

	<p class="block_45"><span class="text_9">4.17.1.</span><span class="text_10"> </span>APEX is used by the joint planning and execution community to monitor, plan, assess, and execute joint operations. APEX formally integrates the strategic-theater and operational planning activities of the Joint Planning and Execution Community and facilitates the joint force commander’s seamless transition from planning to execution during times of crises. APEX activities span many organizational levels, including the interaction between Secretary of Defense and Combatant Commanders, which ultimately helps the President and Secretary of Defense decide when, where, and how to commit U.S. military forces. APEX is used to facilitate the joint operation planning process. </p>
	<p class="block_48">4.17.2. The focus of the joint operation planning process is at the combatant commander level, which use it to determine the best method of accomplishing assigned tasks and direct the actions necessary to accomplish the mission. Joint operation planning is designed to facilitate timely building and maintenance of plans and rapid development of effective options through adaptation of approved operation plans during crisis. Joint operation planning allows for the effective management of operations in execution across the spectrum of mobilization, deployment, employment, sustainment, redeployment and demobilization. Joint operation planning is supported by a networked suite of automated data processing applications, tools, and databases, which reside on the Global Command and Control System. Joint operation planning and execution system is an automated data processing systems include the mechanisms to create and maintain time-phased force deployment data and to submit combatant commander movement requirements to the U.S. Transportation Command. </p>

	<p class="block_7">4.19. Conclusion.</p>
	<p class="block_51">The nature of the challenges to the U.S. and its interests demand that the Armed Forces operate as a fully integrated joint team across the range of military operations. This chapter provided essential information that all members of the joint force should understand. It covered levels of air and space doctrine, key doctrine concepts, AEF concepts, AEF force management, and joint force components and planning operations. Finally, it provided the JOPES used within the joint community for interagency coordination and for U.S. military involvement in multiagency and multinational operations.</p>

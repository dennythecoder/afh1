	<p class="block_1">SECURITY</p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 19A—Overview</p>
	<p class="block_3">19.1. Introduction.</p>
	<p class="block_4">The purpose of security is to never permit the enemy to acquire unexpected advantage…The lethal consequences of enemy attack make the security of friendly forces a paramount concern. Security applies to all members of the Air Force at all times. In certain positions, Airmen are required to handle classified information; at other times, Airmen may be required to serve in a foreign country. Such is the diversity of security. This chapter covers information assurance, installation security, and antiterrorism. These topics are essential to the Air Force mission and the security of all resources. Along with information presented in Chapters 5, Emergency Management Program, and 6, Standards of Conduct, this information helps ensure Air Force forces are prepared to face any adversary.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 19B—Information Assurance</p>
	<p class="block_5">19.2. Information Assurance:</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.2.1. Information assurance refers to the measures that protect and defend information and information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, confidentiality, authentication, and non-repudiation. These measures include providing for restoration of information and information systems by incorporating protection, detection, and reaction capabilities.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.2.2. The Air Force implements and maintains the information assurance program to secure information and information technology assets. The Air Force achieves these objectives through the effective employment of its core information assurance disciplines of computer security, communications security, and TEMPEST (formerly known as emissions security).</p>
	<p class="block_3">19.3. Computer Security:</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Definition.</b></p>
	<p class="block_7">Computer security consists of measures and controls that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems assets including hardware, software, firmware, and information being processed, stored, and communicated.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.3.1.1. Limited Authorized Personal Use. Government-provided hardware and software are for official use and limited authorized personal use only. Limited personal use must be of reasonable duration and frequency that have been approved by the supervisors and do not adversely affect performance of official duties, overburden systems or reflect adversely on the Air Force or the Department of Defense.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.3.1.2. All personal use must be consistent with the requirements of Department of Defense 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.3.1.3. Internet-based capabilities are all publicly accessible information capabilities and applications available across the Internet in locations not owned, operated, or controlled by the Department of Defense or the Federal Government. Internet-based capabilities include collaborative tools such as simple notification service, social media, user-generated content, social software, e-mail, instant messaging, and discussion forums (e.g., YouTube, Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, Google Apps, etc.).</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.3.1.4. When accessing Internet-based capabilities using Federal Government resources in an authorized personal or unofficial capacity, individuals shall comply with operations security guidance (AFI 10-701, <i class="calibre2">Operations Security</i>) and shall not represent the policies or official position of the Air Force or Department of Defense.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Information Systems.</b></p>
	<p class="block_7">An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination or disposition of information. Note: Information Systems also include specialized systems such as industrial/process controls systems, telephone switching and private branch systems, and environmental control systems.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.3.3. <b class="calibre1">Countermeasures.</b></p>
	<p class="block_7">Every Air Force information system has vulnerabilities (system security weaknesses) and is susceptible to exploitation (to gain access to information or disrupt critical processing). A countermeasure is any action, device, procedure, or technique that meets or opposes (i.e. counters) a threat, vulnerability or attack by eliminating, preventing, or minimizing damage, or by discovering and reporting the event, so corrective action(s) can be taken.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.3.4. <b class="calibre1">Threats.</b></p>
	<p class="block_7">Not all threats to our national security are conventional in nature. Threats include, but are not limited to any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information and/or denial of service.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.3.5. <b class="calibre1">Malicious Logic Protection.</b></p>
	<p class="block_7">The Air Force must protect information systems from viruses and other forms of malicious logic by using a combination of human and technological countermeasures to ensure the protection is maintained throughout the lifecycle of the information system.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.3.5.1. <b class="calibre1">Infection.</b> The invasion of information systems applications, processes, or services by a virus or malware code causing the information system to malfunction.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.3.5.2. <b class="calibre1">Detection.</b> A signature or behavior-based antivirus system that signals when an anomaly caused by a virus or malware occurs.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.3.5.3. <b class="calibre1">Reaction.</b> If you are notified of a virus or malware detection, immediately notify your information system security officer and follow local procedures.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.3.6. <b class="calibre1">General Protection of Information Systems.</b></p>
	<p class="block_7">All authorized users must protect information systems against tampering, theft, and loss. Protection from insider and outsider threats occurs by controlling physical access to the facility and data.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.3.6.1. Ensure user access to information system resources and information is based upon their security clearance and need to know. Ensure protection of applicable unclassified, sensitive, and/or classified information using encryption according to the applicable Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2, <i class="calibre2">Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules</i>.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.3.6.2. Protect against casual viewing of information. Place devices that display (or output) classified and sensitive information in a location that deters unauthorized individuals from reading the information. Ensure buildings and rooms that contain information systems are locked during non-duty hours. Classified information systems should be stored in a General Services Administration approved safe or in buildings or areas cleared for open storage of classified.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.3.7. <b class="calibre1">Removable Media Control.</b></p>
	<p class="block_7">Storage media includes, but is not limited to, compact discs, external storage drives, and universal serial bus drives (memory sticks, jump drives, pen drives, etc.). These devices have memory storage capability and are categorized as removable media. Because of the capacity of their memory storage and their portable nature, these devices pose an increased risk of data tampering, theft, or loss. At a minimum, personnel must use these preventive measures:</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.3.7.1. Safeguard, mark, and label removable media according to the requirements for the highest level of information ever contained on the media using applicable information security guidance.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.3.7.2. Report loss or suspected loss of removable media containing sensitive information according to applicable information security guidance from your local security manager or information systems security officer.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.3.7.3. Clear, sanitize, or destroy removable media used to store sensitive information before releasing to unauthorized personnel or outside Department of Defense or Air Force control. Contact your local information systems security officer for guidance and procedures.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.3.7.4. Use your local security guidance before attaching any removable media or storage device to an information system.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.3.7.5. Do not use disguised removable media or storage devices. Air Force policy defines disguised as a device designed to look like anything other than removable media or a storage device (for example, watch, pen, flashlight, etc.).</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.3.8. <b class="calibre1">Mobile Computing Devices.</b></p>
	<p class="block_7">Mobile computing devices are information systems such as portable electronic devices, laptops, smartphones, and other handheld devices that can store data locally and access Air Force managed networks through mobile access capabilities. While many mobile computing devices may have specific security policy and procedures governing their use, all of these devices should follow the same basic requirements.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.3.8.1. All wireless systems (including associated peripheral devices, operation systems, applications, network connection methods, and services) must be approved prior to processing Department of Defense information. The information systems security officer will maintain documented approval authority and inventory information on all approved devices.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.3.8.2. All mobile computing devices (not assigned or in use) must be secured to prevent tampering or theft.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.3.8.3. Users of mobile devices will sign a detailed user agreement outlining the responsibilities and restrictions for use.</p>
	<p class="block_8">19.3.9. <b class="calibre1">Public Computing Facilities or Services.</b></p>
	<p class="block_9">Do not use public computing facilities or services (Internet cafés and kiosks, hotel business centers, etc.) to process government-owned unclassified, sensitive, or classified information. Public computing facilities or services include any information technology resources not under your private or United States governmental control. Use of these resources to access Web-based government services (Outlook® messaging software, Web applications, etc.) constitutes a compromise of login credentials and must be reported as a security incident according to the current Air Force guidance on computer security.</p>
	<p class="block_10">19.4. Communications Security.</p>
	<p class="block_8">Communications security refers to measures and controls taken to deny unauthorized persons information derived from information systems of the United States government related to national security and to ensure the authenticity of such information systems. Communications security protection results from applying security measures (i.e., crypto security, transmission security, and emission security) to communications and information systems generating, handling, storing, processing, or using classified or sensitive information, the loss of which could adversely affect the national security interest. Communications security also entails applying physical security measures to communications security information or materials.</p>
	<p class="block_8">19.4.1. <b class="calibre1">Cryptosecurity.</b></p>
	<p class="block_9">Cryptosecurity is a component of communications security resulting from the provision and proper use of technically sound cryptosystems.</p>
	<p class="block_8">19.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> Transmission Security.</b></p>
	<p class="block_9">Transmission security is a component of communications security resulting from the application of measures designed to protect transmissions from interception and exploitation by means other than cryptoanalysis. Examples of transmission security measures include using secured communications systems, registered mail, secure telephone and facsimile equipment, manual cryptosystems, call signs, or authentication to transmit classified information.</p>
	<p class="block_8">19.4.3. <b class="calibre1">Physical Security.</b></p>
	<p class="block_9">Physical security is the part of communications security resulting from the use of all physical measures necessary to safeguard communications security material from access by unauthorized persons. Physical security measures include the application of control procedures and physical barriers. Physical security also ensures continued integrity, prevents access by unauthorized persons, and controls the spread of communications security techniques and technology when not in the best interest of the United States and allies of the United States. Common physical security measures include verifying the need to know and clearance of personnel granted access, following proper storage and handling procedures, accurately accounting for all materials, transporting materials using authorized means, and immediately reporting the loss or possible compromise of materials.</p>
	<p class="block_10">19.5. TEMPEST (formerly known as Emissions Security).</p>
	<p class="block_6"><b class="calibre1">TEMPEST</b> is protection resulting from all measures taken to deny unauthorized persons information of value that may be derived from the interception and analysis of compromising emanations from crypto equipment, information systems, and telecommunications systems. The objective of emissions security is to deny access to classified and, in some instances, unclassified information that contain compromising emanations within an inspectable space. The inspectable space is considered the area in which it would be difficult for an adversary with specialized equipment to attempt to intercept compromising emanations without being detected. TEMPEST countermeasures (classified/unclassified equipment separation, shielding, grounding, etc.) are implemented to reduce the risk of compromising emanations escaping the inspectable space. The TEMPEST countermeasures must be validated by the Certified TEMPEST Technical Authority prior to any classified processing in the facility.</p>

	<p class="block_3">19.6. Operations Security:</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.6.1. <b class="calibre1">Operations Security Defined:</b></p>
	<p class="block_7">19.6.1.1. Operation security is a process of identifying, analyzing, and controlling critical information indicating friendly actions associated with military operations and other activities to:</p>
	<p class="block_12">19.6.1.1.1. Identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems.</p>
	<p class="block_12">19.6.1.2.2. Determine what specific indications could be collected, analyzed, and interpreted to derive critical information in time to be useful to adversaries.</p>
	<p class="block_12">19.6.1.3.3. Select and execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities of <span class="tab">      </span>friendly actions to adversary exploitation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.6.1.2. Operation security is closely integrated and synchronized with other influence operations capabilities to protect operations and is not a collection of specific rules and instructions that can be applied to every operation.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.6.2. <b class="calibre1">Purpose.</b></p>
	<p class="block_7">The purpose of Operation security is to reduce the vulnerability of Air Force missions by eliminating or reducing successful adversary collection and exploitation of critical information. Operation security applies to all activities that prepare, sustain, or employ forces during all phases of operations.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.6.3.<b class="calibre1"> Operational Context.</b></p>
	<p class="block_7">Operational effectiveness is enhanced when commanders and other decision makers apply Operation security from the earliest stages of planning. Operation security involves a series of analyses to examine the planning, preparation, execution, and post execution phases of any operation or activity across the entire spectrum of military action and in any operational environment. Operation security analysis provides decision makers with a means of weighing the risk to their operations. Decision makers must determine the amount of risk they are willing to accept in particular operational circumstances in the same way as operations risk management allows commanders to assess risk in mission planning.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.6.4. <b class="calibre1">Signature Management Methodology Defined:</b></p>
	<p class="block_7">19.6.4.1. Signature management is the active defense or exploitation of operational profiles resident at a given military installation. Defense of operational profiles is accomplished by implementing protective signature management measures to deny adversary collection of critical information.</p>
	<p class="block_13"><span class="calibre3">19.6.4.2. Base profiling is a process within signature management that identifies the local operating environment and captures process points that present key signatures and profiles with critical information value. This process is the deliberate effort to identify functional areas and the observables they produce to contribute to the overall signature of day-to-day activities and operational trends.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_6">19.6.5.<b class="calibre1"> Implementing Operation Security.</b></p>
	<p class="block_13">Air Force forces can be under observation at their peacetime bases and locations, in training or exercises, while moving, or when deployed to the field conducting actual operations. Operation security methodology provides systematic and comprehensive analysis designed to identify observable friendly actions that could reveal intentions or capabilities. Air Force units utilize the base profiling process to identify vulnerabilities and indicators of their day-to-day activities. With this understanding, Air Force operation security program m<span class="calibre3">anagers use the signature management methodology to apply measures and/or countermeasures to hide, control, or simulate indicators.   Therefore, </span>operation security principles must be integrated into operational, support, exercise, and acquisition planning. Operation security is incorporated into day-to-day activities to ensure a seamless transition to contingency operations. The operation security process consists of five distinct steps:</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.6.5.1. Identify critical information.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.6.5.2. Analyze threats.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.6.5.3. Analyze vulnerabilities.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.6.5.4. Assess risk.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.6.5.5. Apply appropriate operation security countermeasures.</p>
	<p class="block_14"> </p>
	<p class="block_6">19.6.6. <b class="calibre1">Operation Security Indicators.</b></p>
	<p class="block_7">Operation security indicators are friendly, detectable actions, and open-source information that can be interpreted or pieced together by an adversary to derive critical information. The five basic characteristics of operation security indicators that make them potentially valuable to an adversary include:</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.6.6.1. <b class="calibre1">Signatures. </b>This characteristic of an indicator is identifiable or to stand out.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.6.6.2. <b class="calibre1">Associations. </b>The relationship of an indicator to other information or activities.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.6.6.3. <b class="calibre1">Profiles. </b>Each functional activity generates their own set of more-or-less unique signatures and associations. The sum of these signatures and associations is the activity’s profile.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.6.6.4. <b class="calibre1">Contrasts. </b>Any differences observed between an activity’s standard profile and most recent or current actions.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.6.6.5. <b class="calibre1">Exposure. </b>Refers to when and for how long an indicator is observed. The longer an indicator is observed, the better chance an adversary can observe the indicator and form associations and/or update the profile of operational activities.</p>
	<p class="block_3">19.7. Information Security.</p>
	<p class="block_6">All personnel in the Air Force are responsible for protecting classified information and controlled unclassified information under their custody and control.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.7.1.<b class="calibre1"> Classified Information. </b>Information shall be classified only to protect national security. There are three levels of classification: Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential. Information may only be classified by either original classification or derivative classification. Each individual is responsible for providing the proper safeguards for classified information, reporting security incidents, and understand the sanctions for noncompliance.</p>
	<p class="block_15">19.7.1.1. <b class="calibre1">Top Secret.</b> Top Secret shall be applied to information the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.</p>
	<p class="block_15">19.7.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Secret.</b> Secret shall be applied to information the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.</p>
	<p class="block_15">19.7.1.3. <b class="calibre1">Confidential</b>. Confidential shall be applied to information the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.</p>
	<p class="block_15">19.7.1.4.<b class="calibre1"> Original Classification. </b>Original classification is the initial decision by an original classification authority that an item of information could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable or describable damage to the national security subjected to unauthorized disclosure and requires protection in the interest of national security. Only officials designated in writing may make original classification decisions.</p>
	<p class="block_16">19.7.1.5. <b class="calibre1">Derivative Classification</b>. Air Force policy is to identify, classify, downgrade, declassify, mark, protect, and destroy classified information consistent with national policy. Controlled unclassified information will also be protected per national policy, DoDM 5200.01, Volumes 1 and 4, <i class="calibre2">Department of Defense Information Security Program</i>: <i class="calibre2">Overview, Classification, and Declassification</i>, February 24, 2012 and DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2 and 3, <i class="calibre2">Department of Defense Information Security Program</i>, February 24, 2012, Incorporating Change 2, March 19, 2013, <i class="calibre2">Department of Defense Information Security Program,</i> and AFI 16-1404, Air Force <i class="calibre2">Information Security Program, </i>provide the guidance for managing classified information and controlled unclassified information. Within the Department of Defense all cleared personnel are authorized to derivatively classify information provided they have received initial training before making derivative classification decisions and refresher at least once every 2 years. Derivative classification is the incorporating, paraphrasing, restating, or generating classified information in a new form or document and is not photocopying or otherwise mechanically or electronically reproducing classified material. Derivative classifiers must use authorized types of sources for making decisions. One of the most important responsibilities of derivative classifier is to observe and respect the classification determinations made by an original classification authority.</p>
	<p class="block_16">19.7.1.6. <b class="calibre1">Marking Classified Information.</b> All classified information shall be clearly identified by marking, designation, or electronic labelling in accordance with DoDM 5200.01, Vol 2,<i class="calibre2"> Department of Defense Information Security Program</i>: <i class="calibre2">Marking of Classified Information</i>. Markings are used to:</p>
	<p class="block_16">19.7.1.6.1. Alert holders to the presence of classified information.</p>
	<p class="block_16">19.7.1.6.2. Identify, as specifically as possible, the exact information needing protection.</p>
	<p class="block_16">19.7.1.6.3. Indicate the level of classification assigned to the information.</p>
	<p class="block_13">19.7.1.6.4. Provide guidance on downgrading (if any) and declassification.</p>
	<p class="block_13">19.7.1.6.5. Give information on the sources of and reasons for classification.</p>
	<p class="block_13"><span class="text_">19.7.1.6.6. Notify holders of special access, control, or safeguarding requirements.</span><span class="text_1"> </span></p>
	<p class="block_13">19.7.1.6.7. Promote information sharing, facilitate judicious use of resources, and simplify management through implementation of uniform and standardized processes.</p>
	<p class="block_13">19.7.1.7. <b class="calibre1">Specific Markings on Documents. </b>Every classified document must be marked to show the highest classification of information contained within the document. The marking must be conspicuous enough to alert anyone handling the document that the document is classified. Every document will contain the overall classification of the document, portion markings indicating the classification level of specific classified information within the document, the originating office, date of origin, and downgrading instructions, if any, and declassification instructions. The three most common markings on a classified document are the banner lines, portion markings, and the classification authority block.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.7.1.7.1. <b class="calibre1">Banner Lines.</b> Are conspicuously placed at the top and bottom of the outside of the front cover (if any), title page (if any), first page, and on the outside of the back cover (if any or last page of each classified document. These markings are usually centered on the page. Examples of Banner Markings in DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2, <i class="calibre2">DoD Information Security Program</i>: <i class="calibre2">Marking of Classified Information</i> for an illustration.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.7.1.7.2. <b class="calibre1">Portion Marks.</b> Every subject, title, paragraph, section, tab, attachment, classified signature block, bullets, tables and pictures in every classified document shall be marked to show the highest level of classification contained within the document. Use these symbols in uppercase letters to indicate the highest classification level in the portion: (TS) for Top Secret, (S) for Secret, and (C) for Confidential. Examples of Portion Markings in DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2, <i class="calibre2">Department of Defense Information Security Program</i>: <i class="calibre2">Marking of Classified Information</i>, for illustration.</p>
	<p class="block_13">19.7.1.7.3. <b class="calibre1">Classification Authority Block.</b> This block appears on the face of each classified United States document unless otherwise stated in DoDM 5200.01, Volumes 1-4. There are two types of classification authority blocks. One is used by an original classifier and the other by a derivative classifier. Original classification authority block will contain a: Classified By (name of classifier), Reason, Downgrade To (if any), and Declassify On line. Refer to DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2, <i class="calibre2">Department of Defense Information Security Program</i>: <i class="calibre2">Marking of Classified Information</i>, for an illustration of an Originally Classified Document. Derivative classification authority block will contain a: Classified by (name of classifier), Derived From (identify sources), Downgrade To (if any) and Declassify On lines. Refer to DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2, <i class="calibre2">Department of Defense Information Security Program</i>: <i class="calibre2">Marking of Classified Information</i>, for an illustration of an Derivatively Classified Document.</p>
	<p class="block_13">19.7.1.8. <b class="calibre1">Challenges. </b>Personnel should submit challenges of classification to their security manager or the classifier of the information if substantial reason exists to indicate the document has been classified improperly or unnecessarily</p>
	<p class="block_13">19.7.1.9.<b class="calibre1"> Safeguarding.</b> Everyone who works with classified information is personally responsible for taking proper precautions to ensure that unauthorized persons do not gain access to classified information. There are two primary types of protection that must be employed at all times: (1) store the information using approved means; or (2) having it under the personal observation and control of an authorized individual.</p>
	<p class="block_13">19.7.1.9.1. <b class="calibre1">Access to Classified Information.</b> Before granting access to classified information the person must have: (1) security clearance eligibility; (2) a signed Standard Form 312, <i class="calibre2">Classified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement</i>; and (3) a need-to-know. The individual’s responsibility with authorized possession, knowledge, or control of the information is to determine whether the person receiving the information has been granted the appropriate security clearance access by proper authority.</p>
	<p class="block_13">19.7.1.9.2. <b class="calibre1">Protection When Under Personal Observation or Control.</b> An authorized person shall keep classified material removed from storage under constant surveillance. The authorized person must place coversheets on classified documents not in secure storage to prevent unauthorized persons from viewing the information. The following forms will be used to cover classified information outside of storage: Standard Form 703, <i class="calibre2">Top Secret</i>, Standard Form 704, <i class="calibre2">Secret</i>, and Standard Form 705, <i class="calibre2">Confidential</i>.</p>
	<p class="block_17"> </p>
	<p class="block_13">19.7.1.9.3. <b class="calibre1">End-of-Day Security Checks.</b> Use Standard Form 701, <i class="calibre2">Activity Security Checklist</i>, to record the end of the day security check if you are appointed to conduct the check. This form is required for any area where classified information is used or stored. Ensure all vaults, secure rooms, and containers used for storing classified material are checked.</p>
	<p class="block_16">19.7.1.9.4. <b class="calibre1">Security Incidents Involving Classified Information.</b> Anyone finding classified material out of proper control must take custody of and safeguard the material and immediately notify his or her commander, supervisor or security manager. The terms associated with security incidents are formally defined DoDM 5200.01 Volume 3. The following general characterizations are provided:</p>
	<p class="block_16">19.7.1.9.4.1. <b class="calibre1">Infraction.</b> An infraction is a security incident involving failure to comply with requirements which cannot reasonably be expected to, and does not, result in the loss, suspected compromise, or compromise of classified information. An infraction may be unintentional or inadvertent and does not constitute a security violation, if left uncorrected, can lead to security violations or compromises. Infraction requires an inquiry to facilitate immediate corrective action but does not require an in-depth investigation.</p>
	<p class="block_16">19.7.1.9.4.2. <b class="calibre1">Violation.</b> Violations are security incidents that indicate knowing, willful, and negligent for security regulations, and result in, or could be expected to result in, the loss or compromise of classified information.

AFI 31-601, <i class="calibre2">Industrial Security Program Management, </i>assigns functional responsibilities and establishes a system of review that identifies outdated, inappropriate, and unnecessary contractual security requirements. Policy also outlines and provides guidance for establishing on-base integrated contractor visitor groups.</p>
	<p class="block_8">19.9.2. <b class="calibre1">Scope.</b></p>
	<p class="block_9">The security policies, requirements, and procedures identified in AFI 31-601 are applicable to Air Force personnel and on-base Department of Defense contractors performing services under the terms of a properly executed contract and associated security agreement or similar document, as determined appropriate by the installation commander.</p>
	<p class="block_10">19.10. Integrated Defense Program:</p>
	<p class="block_13">19.10.1. The Air Force Integrated Defense Program is the integration of multidisciplinary active and passive, offensive and defensive capabilities, employed to mitigate potential risks and defeat adversary threats to Air Force operations within the base boundary and the base security zone. These threats include, but are not limited to, terrorist, insiders, criminals, and foreign intelligence and security services. To integrate Integrated Defense efforts with other Air Force capabilities to achieve synergistic effects using an all-hazards approach is critical. Potential hazards to an installation include, but are not limited to, chemical biological radiological nuclear-high yield explosive attacks, natural and man-made disasters, major accidents, and accidental or deliberate release of hazardous materials, toxic industrial materials or chemicals (see AFPD 31-1, <i class="calibre2">Integrated Defense</i>). Integrated Defense is a fundamental battle competency for all Airmen, whether garrison or deployed. The teaming of Integrated Defense forces creates a united, seamless defense stronger than the defensive efforts of individuals/or individual units. This effort ensures all Airmen are trained to defend themselves and integrate into defense operations while in garrison or deployed. Installation commanders determine the effects required of Integrated Defense operations at Air Force installations based on a four-step process that involves:<span class="text_2"> </span></p>
	<p class="block_9">19.10.1.1. Determining and prioritizing the criticality of installation assets.</p>
	<p class="block_9">19.10.1.2. Analyzing the threats and operating environment.</p>
	<p class="block_9">19.10.1.3. Assessing the installation’s vulnerabilities to the threats.</p>
	<p class="block_9">19.10.1.4. Making prudent integrated defense decisions based on the risk estimate. The integrated defense risk management process is critical in order for the installation commander to make the best use of limited resources and personnel available to execute the Integrated Defense mission.</p>
	<p class="block_8">19.10.2. Integrated defense is an “all-Airmen” program. However, Air Force Security Forces have enterprise lead in Integrated Defense operations. The defense force commander synchronizes integrated defense operations with emergency and consequence management activities articulated in applicable Air Force and Department of Defense publications.</p>
	<p class="block_8">19.10.3. The goal of Integrated Defense is to neutralize security threats within the base boundary and the base security zone in order to ensure unhindered Air Force operations. Through Integrated Defense, commanders must: (1) minimize mission degradation from threat activity within the base boundary and coordinate necessary security operations support within the base security zone when the base security zone is not congruent with the base boundary; (2) minimize loss of life and injury from threat activity; and (3) protect government property and personnel from hostile and criminal acts.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.10.4. Integrated Defense does not stand alone to protect personnel and resources; planners create an effective security program by coordinating with other Department of Defense and Air Force programs. Furthermore, the protection and defense of air bases requires the coordinated effort of emergency management, antiterrorism, and other mission support function forces under the mission assurance umbrella. This coordinated planning provides a seamless progression of mission assurance programs and completes the installation’s defense in depth picture.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.10.5.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Joint Publications define the base boundary as a line that delineates the surface area of a base for the purpose of facilitating coordination and deconfliction of operations between adjacent units, formations, or areas. See Figure 19.1 for an example of a base boundary configuration. Therefore, the base boundary is not necessarily the base perimeter. Rather, the base boundary should be established based upon the factors of mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, civil considerations, specifically balancing the need of the base defense forces to control key terrain with their ability to accomplish the mission. These measures decrease the likelihood of fratricide, prevent non-combatant casualties, and minimize damage to the property of friendly civilians. Boundaries may not necessarily coincide with the fenced perimeter, property lines or legal boundaries. Nevertheless, while tactical considerations will ideally determine Integrated Defense boundaries, the defense force commander will strictly adhere to legal, jurisdictional, host nation constraints, commander’s intent, and higher echelon orders and directives when conducting operations within the base boundary.</p>
	<p class="block_6"><span class="text_1"></span><span class="text_">19.10.6.</span><span class="text_3"> </span><span class="text_">The base security zone is an Air Force unique concept and term to be used intraservice only. The Air Force uses the planning term base security zone to describe the area of concern around an air base and to support the establishment and adjustment of the base boundary. The base security zone is the area outside the base perimeter from which the base may be vulnerable from standoff threats (for example, mortars, rockets, man portable aerial defense systems). The installation commander should identify the base security zone and coordinate via the operational chain of command with local, state, federal agencies (within the continental United States) or host nation or area commander (outside the continental United States) for the base security zone to be identified as the base boundary. If the base boundary does not include all of the base security zone terrain, the installation commander is still responsible for either mitigating (through coordination with local, state, federal agencies (continental United States) or the area commander or host nation (outside the continental United States) or accepting the risks of enemy attack from the terrain outside the base boundary. The base security zone, in the simplest terms, is the area from which a threat can launch an attack against base personnel and resources or aircraft approaching/departing the base. Air-minded forces must consider the base security zone for planning constructs continental United States, outside the continental United States, and at contingency locations. Threats vary in the Integrated Defense continuum from peacetime to wartime, regardless of the location of our installations.</span></p>
	<p class="block_22">Figure 19.1. Base Boundary Configuration </p>
	<p class="block_22">Figure 19.1. Base Boundary Configuration </p>
	<p class="block_7">19.10.6.1. Optimally, the base security zone and the base boundary are the same, but that is not always the case. The base security zone may, for planning purposes, incorporate more geographical area than the base boundary. For example, there may be key terrain outside the base boundary from which adversaries can impact air operations.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.10.6.2. For terrain outside the base boundary, but within the base security zone, the defense force commander should coordinate with local, state, federal agencies (continental United States) or host nation or area commander (outside the continental United States) to conduct base defense tasks within the area. If these forces/agencies are not available due to competing requirements, then the defense force commander should coordinate via their operational chain of command with the appropriate area commander to conduct the base defense task. When defense forces operate outside the base boundary, the appropriate area of operations commander should exercise tactical control over those forces for base defense purposes only. Joint and coalition forces entering the base boundary should inform the base defense operations center before they enter, and monitor the base defense operations center’s communication net while operating in the area.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.10.6.3. The base defense operations center is the command and control center for Integrated Defense operations during routine and emergency operations. The defense force commander will establish a base defense operations center to coordinate and direct, via their operational chain of command, the tactical control of Integrated Defense forces and supporting capabilities. All functions performed by central security control, the law enforcement desk, or other security forces control centers will be performed by the base defense operations center at all locations, home station and deployed.</p>
	<p class="block_3">19.11. Integrated Defense Effects:</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.11.1. Commanders execute Integrated Defense with the objective of achieving nine desired effects based on the risk management process described in paragraph 19.12. Those effects are:</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.11.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> Anticipate. </b>Anticipate threat intentions and actions (Intelligence Preparation of the Operational Environment or crime trend analysis).</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.11.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Deter. </b>Deter threat activity through active community policing (e.g., Eagle Eyes Program), boundary and internal circulation control, controlled area marking, prudent physical security measures.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.11.1.3.<b class="calibre1"> Detect. </b>Detect threats through the use of lighting, Intrusion Detection Systems/Early Warning Systems, closed-circuit television, etc.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.11.1.4.<b class="calibre1"> Assess. </b>Assess to identify friend or foe using cameras, posted sentries, response forces, integrated delivery system, etc.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.11.1.5.<b class="calibre1"> Warn. </b>Warn friendly forces of adversary activity through systems such as mass notification, radio, public address, commander’s access channels, voice, hand and arm signals, cellular telephones, instant messenger/short message system texting, etc.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.11.1.6. <b class="calibre1">Defeat. </b>Defeat threats through appropriate, progressive force application; coordinated security force response; and integration of total force.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.11.1.7. <b class="calibre1">Delay. </b>Delay adversaries using a layered application of barriers, obstacles, technology, physical security measures, and forces (defense-in-depth).</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.11.1.8. <b class="calibre1">Defend. </b>Defend assets through threat- and effects-based planning that integrates all friendly forces into a single, comprehensive plan by ensuring friendly forces are trained and qualified on Arming and Use of Force. Also, ensure the<span class="calibre3"> fighting positions are positioned where prudent based on risk analyses.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_7">19.11.1.9.<b class="calibre1"> Recover. </b>Recover from adversarial events by applying effective command and control, and developing and exercising comprehensive emergency management plan 10-2.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.11.2. These effects are not randomly applied to an installation instead they are deliberately achieved through innovative and reliable tactics, techniques, and procedures based on the Integrated Defense risk management process and analysis.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.11.3. Ideally, defense forces receive such good intelligence they are able to anticipate any and all threats. As this is unlikely, attaining subsequent Integrated Defense desired effects is necessary. For instance, it would be preferred to deter a threat; but if that does not succeed, the next ideal effect would be to detect the threat. Once the threat is detected, assessment by forces occurs. Friendly forces are then warned of the threat and attempts are made to defeat, or eliminate, the threat. If the threat cannot be defeated, it must be delayed. If not possible, defensive measures must be taken to mitigate the effects of the threat. Recovery actions are then implemented to consolidate and reorganize friendly forces and restore operations.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.11.4.<b class="calibre1"> </b>The intelligence fusion cell is an action group whereby the security forces staff S-2 (intelligence) function coordinates with subject matter experts from the Intelligence and Air Force Office of Special investigations communities to collaborate and conduct intelligence preparation of the operational environment. The goal is to leverage information and intelligence to support the timely identification of indicators and warnings of emerging localized threats. The intelligence fusion cell and the products of the fusion cells are the primary information sources that directly support the defense force commander in making immediate, proactive decisions for Integrated Defense planning.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.11.5.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Intelligence preparation of the battlefield/battlespace is an analytical methodology that provides predictive intelligence to warfighters for use in planning and executing operations. A systematic, four-step process, intelligence preparation of the battlefield/battlespace’s bottom line intent is to support operational decisions by providing analyzed information regarding the threat and environment<i class="calibre2"> </i>in a given set of circumstances. Intelligence preparation of the battlefield/battlespace is the primary mechanism used to achieve the Integrated Defense desired effect of “anticipate.” Furthermore, this analytical methodology is a continuous process, enabling the commander to visualize: (1) the spectrum of friendly and adversarial capabilities and weakness; (2) how they are affected by a variety of environmental factors (for example; (3) weather, light, terrain, political and social conditions), and (4) the logical predictions of the most likely and most dangerous enemy course of action.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.11.6. Intelligence preparation of the battlefield/battlespace is a continuous, four-part process: (1) defines the operating environment; (2) describes the operating environment’s effects; (3) evaluates the enemy; and (4) determines enemy course of action. The examples below should be collected, analyzed, and applied to the tactical situation, as a minimum.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.11.6.1. <b class="calibre1">Part 1.</b> This part is comprised of comprehensive lists, dispositions, and capabilities (offensive and defensive) of tasked friendly forces and other forces (for example, host nation military and police forces, local, state, national agencies [continental United States] and host nation [outside the continental United States]) that contribute to the security of the installation and are available to contribute during enemy surges (for example, increased force protection conditions; terrain and weather (including light data); and background data on the operating environment to include history, demographics, socioeconomic data, religious groups, etc. Incident and emergency response plans should also be identified in Part 1 for later consideration during war-gaming conducted during Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace Part 4.</p>
	<p class="block_14"> </p>
	<p class="block_7">19.11.6.2. <b class="calibre1">Part 2.</b> Analyze the data collected in Part 1 and describe how the factors affect operations, equipment, and personnel. Whenever possible, use color-coded stoplight charts that use green, yellow, and red coding to describe aspects of operations or effects on personnel and equipment. For example, use mission capable (green), partially mission capable (yellow), or non-mission capable (red).</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.11.6.3. <b class="calibre1">Part 3.</b> Collect historical data and existing intelligence analyses (for example, Defense Intelligence Agency country reports or Air Force Office of Special Investigations defense threat assessments of the operating environment, or other reports about adversaries capable of operating in the geographic area of concern. Consider the capabilities and weaknesses of each specific group without assuming that all enemy forces collaborate. Consider and analyze the effects of the operating environment (gathered in Part 1 and analyzed in Part 2) on each individual adversary.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.11.6.4. <b class="calibre1">Part 4.</b> Consider all data collected in the previous three parts and make logical predictions of enemy course of actions. For each adversary assessed to be present and capable, establish a prediction of the most likely and most dangerous enemy course of actions. Then, through a process of war-gaming, establish friendly courses of action that would effectively meet the commander’s intent in defeating the predicted enemy course of actions.</p>
	<p class="block_3">19.12. Integrated Defense Risk Management Process.</p>
	<p class="block_6">The integrated defense risk management process provides installation commanders, integrated defense working groups, defense force commanders and defense planners the ability to produce effects-based, integrated defense plans by using a standardized model to identify risks and develop risk management strategies. These strategies leverage finite resources against adaptive threats to protect Air Force resources and personnel. The integrated defense risk management process identifies at risk assets and aids the integrated defense working groups in generating the criticality assessment and the risk assessment<i class="calibre2"> </i>products. A risk reduction decision based on a clear understanding of what is important, the estimated threat, and how the asset might be damaged/destroyed, is then developed through a logical process involving asset criticality assessment, threat assessment, and vulnerability assessment. The integrated defense risk management process analyzes an installation’s defense capabilities and provides options to mitigate security risks, such as additional tactics, techniques, and procedures, facility hardening, technology insertion, etc.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.12.1. The integrated defense risk management process has four main components: (1) the risk assessment (as described above); (2) the risk tolerance decision; (3) courses of action determination; and (4) decision and implementation. All four components are directly influenced by the evolving situation monitored through the Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace cycle. As such, new information, assessments, or decisions can be assimilated into the integrated defense risk management process at any point, which may alter the execution of Integrated Defense. These four components are performed in the following seven steps:</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.12.1.1. <b class="calibre1">Step 1: Develop the Criticality Assessment.</b> The criticality assessment identifies assets worthy of protection whose loss or damage would have a negative impact on the mission. Fundamental to this evaluation is the criteria used to measure asset value or consequence of loss. Typical criteria include mission criticality, impact on national defense, replace-ability, monetary value, and relative (or intrinsic) value.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.12.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Step 2 and Step 3: Develop the Threat Assessment and Vulnerability Assessment.</b> Threat multiplied by vulnerability determines the probability of loss (or damage) of the asset. Threats are generally considered in terms of adversaries and their tactics (for example, hackers, terrorists, criminals, protestors). To know if adversaries pose a threat requires information about their operational capability, intentions, activity, operating environment, and history. Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that can be exploited by an adversary because of inadequate security, lax or complacent personnel trends, vulnerable software or hardware, and insufficient security policies or procedures. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b> Identification and evaluation of existing threats and vulnerabilities are identified during Parts 1 through 3 of the intelligence preparation of the operational environment process and may be supplemented with other documents, such as antiterrorism vulnerability assessments.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.12.1.3. <b class="calibre1">Step 4: Develop the Risk Assessment.</b> Once all previous assessments (criticality, threat, and vulnerability) are completed and studied together to provide a complete picture of the risks to an asset, the risk assessment can be developed. A quantitative measurement of risk can be determined using the following equation: risk = asset criticality multiplied by (threat multiplied by vulnerability).</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.12.1.4. <b class="calibre1">Step 5: Risk Tolerance Decision. </b>At this point in the integrated defense risk management process, the commander may have enough data to enable an informed risk tolerance decision. But if information required to assess risks is deficient, a command critical intelligence requirement should be developed or modified to guide the intelligence community’s collection efforts. In today’s resource-constrained environment, some risks must be accepted. However, some risks cannot be tolerated due to their frequency or severity of consequence. The installation commander’s intent for Integrated Defense will define the level of tolerance. For risks exceeding the commander’s tolerance level, countermeasures will be developed in the next step to render these risks more acceptable.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.12.1.5. <b class="calibre1">Step 6: Present Countermeasure Courses of Action.</b> This step presents and evaluates options for reducing risks. While risks can be alleviated by reducing the asset’s criticality or mitigating the threat, eliminating vulnerabilities is the area that can have the most impact on the installation commander’s risk tolerance decision. At this time, the integrated defense working group can develop various countermeasure courses of action to remove or mitigate vulnerabilities and reduce unacceptable risks. An estimate of risk reduction (i.e., benefit of risk reduction) can be prepared, along with showing the costs associated with courses of action implementation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">19.12.1.6. <b class="calibre1">Step 7: Decision and Implementation.</b> This is the most important step in the integrated defense risk management process. During this step, the installation commander selects the course of actions that will bring the risks within his/her tolerance level, and directs resources to implement the decision. Closely tied with step 7 is continuous assessment. This feedback loop posits that risk management is not an event or tangible product, but rather a continuous cycle. The implementation of countermeasure courses of action will sometimes change the installation’s risk posture in unexpected or unintended ways. By immediately identifying changes to the installation’s critical assets, threats and vulnerabilities, decision makers can continually refine the installation’s risk posture.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.12.2. Integrated Defense provides flexible planning and execution opportunities that allow owners/users of protection level 1 (PL1) non-nuclear, protection level 2 (PL2), protection level 3 (PL3), and protection level 4 (PL4) assets to become actively involved in the defense of their areas.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.12.3. The integrated defense risk management process provides a more precise understanding of how the three risk factors of threat, vulnerability and asset criticality relate to each other at each installation. Understanding the relationships between these factors, as well as continually analyzing the operating environment, assists commanders in mitigating, accepting, and reducing risks to appropriate levels.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.12.4. Operationalize force protection intelligence in order to maintain optimal situational awareness throughout the base boundary and base security zone. This can be accomplished for the defense force commanders through the development of a robust intelligence/information collaboration, analysis, and fusion capability.</p>
	<p class="block_3">19.13. Security Protection Levels:</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.13.1. <b class="calibre1">Protection Level 1 (PL1).</b></p>
	<p class="block_7">PL1 is assigned to those resources for which the loss, theft, destruction, misuse, or compromise would result in unacceptable mission degradation to the strategic capability of the United States or catastrophic consequences for the nation. Examples of PL1 resources are nuclear weapons in storage, mated to a delivery system, or in transit; designated command, control, and communications facilities; and aircraft designated to transport the President of the United States. PL1 security must result in the greatest possible deterrence against hostile acts. This level of security will provide maximum means to detect and defeat a hostile force before it is able to seize, damage, or destroy resources.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.13.2. <b class="calibre1">Protection Level 2 (PL2).</b></p>
	<p class="block_7">PL2 is assigned to resources for which the loss, theft, destruction, misuse, or compromise would result in significant mission degradation to the war fighting capability of the United States. Examples of PL2 resources are nonnuclear alert forces; designated space and launch systems; expensive, few in number, or one-of-a-kind systems or facilities; and intelligence-gathering systems. PL2 security must result in significant deterrence against hostile acts. This level of security will ensure a significant probability of detecting and defeating a hostile force before PL2 is able to seize, damage, or destroy resources.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.13.3. <b class="calibre1">Protection Level 3 (PL3).</b></p>
	<p class="block_13">PL3 is assigned to resources for which the loss, theft, destruction, misuse, or compromise would result in mission degradation to the United States warfighting capability. Examples of PL3 resources are non-alert resources that can be generated to alert status, such as F-16 fighters; selected command, control, and communications facilities, systems, and equipment; and non-launch-critical or non-unique space launch systems. PL3 security must result in a reasonable degree of deterrence against hostile acts. This level of security ensures the capability to impede a hostile force and limit damage to resources.</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.13.4. <b class="calibre1">Protection Level 4 (PL4).</b></p>
	<p class="block_23">PL4 is assigned to operational or mission support resources that directly or indirectly support power projection assess and the war fighting mission for which the loss, theft, destruction, misuse, or compromise would adversely affect mission capability. Examples of PL4 resources are facilities storing Category I, II, or III sensitive conventional arms, ammunition, and explosives; fuels and liquid oxygen storage areas; and Air Force accounting and finance vault areas. PL4 resources are secured by containing them in controlled areas with owners/users being responsible for security. Security forces provide response to threats. This level of security must reduce the opportunity for theft of or damage to resources.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 19D—Antiterrorism Program</p>
	<p class="block_3">19.14. Air Force Antiterrorism Program Defined.</p>
	<p class="block_6">The program seeks to deter or limit the effects of terrorist acts against the Air Force by giving guidance on collecting and disseminating timely threat information, providing training to all Air Force members, developing comprehensive plans to deter and counter terrorist incidents, allocating funds and personnel, and implementing antiterrorism measures.</p>
	<p class="block_3">19.15. Antiterrorism Training and Exercises.</p>
	<p class="block_6">At least annually, commanders conduct comprehensive field and staff training to exercise antiterrorism plans, to include antiterrorism physical security measures, Continuity of Operations Program, Critical Asset Risk Management and emergency management plans. Antiterrorism training and exercises shall be afforded the same emphasis as combat task training and executed with the intent to identify shortfalls affecting the protection of personnel, assets and information against terrorist attack and subsequent antiterrorism consequence management efforts. Antiterrorism, an area of responsibility specific training, particularly pre-deployment training, should include terrorism scenarios specific to the deployed location and based on current enemy Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, and lessons learned. Additionally, the current baseline through force protection condition Charlie measures shall be exercised annually at installations and self-supported<b class="calibre1"> </b>separate facilities.</p>
	<p class="block_10">19.16. Threat Information Collection and Analysis:</p>
	<p class="block_6">19.16.1. Commanders shall task the appropriate organizations under their command to gather, analyze, and disseminate terrorism threat information, as appropriate. To support the commander, the Services should continuously ensure forces are trained to maximize the use of information derived from law enforcement liaison, intelligence, and counterintelligence processes and procedures. This includes intelligence procedures for handling priority intelligence requests for in-transit units as well as implementation of procedures to conduct intelligence preparation of the space and mission analysis.</p>
	<p class="block_8">19.16.2. Identifying the potential terrorism threat to Department of Defense personnel and assets and how the hazards affect the mission is the first step in developing an effective antiterrorism program. Commanders at all levels who understand the threat can assess their ability to prevent, survive, and prepare to respond to an attack. A terrorism threat assessment requires the identification of a full range of known or estimated terrorist threat capabilities (including the use or threat of use of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosives and weapons of mass destruction). In addition to tasking appropriate agencies to collect information, commanders at all levels can and should encourage personnel under their command to report information on individuals, events, or situations that could pose a threat to the security of Department of Defense personnel, families, facilities, and resources.</p>
	<p class="block_8">19.16.3. At the strategic level, the D<span class="text_4">eputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (Air Force/A2) and the Director for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Strategy, Doctrine and Force Development (Air Force/A2D)</span><span class="text_5"> </span>is responsible for ensuring the timely collection processing, analysis, production, and dissemination of foreign intelligence, current intelligence, and national-level intelligence information concerning terrorist activities, terrorist organizations, and force protection issues. These efforts will focus on, but not be limited to, transnational and state-sponsored entities and organizations. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations is the lead Air Force agency for collection, investigation, analysis, and response for threats arising from terrorists, criminal activity and foreign intelligence and security services. Air Force Office of Special Investigations is primarily focused on countering adversary intelligence collection activities against United States forces and will act as the Air Force single point of contact with federal, state, local and foreign nation law enforcement, counterintelligence, and security agencies.</p>
	<p class="block_24"><b class="calibre1">19.17.</b> <b class="calibre1">Department of Defense Random Antiterrorism Measures Program.</b></p>
	<p class="block_8">Installation commanders shall develop and implement a random antiterrorism measures program that will include all units on the installation. The intent of the random antiterrorism measures program is to provide random, multiple security measures that consistently change the look of an installation’s antiterrorism program. Random antiterrorism measures introduce uncertainty to an installation’s overall force protection program to defeat surveillance attempts and make random antiterrorism measures difficult for a terrorist to accurately predict our actions. The random antiterrorism measures program shall be included in antiterrorism plans and tie directly with all force protection condition (including force protection condition normal) to ensure continuity and standardization should threats require Air Force-wide implementation. Random antiterrorism measures times for implementation, location, and duration shall be regularly changed to avoid predictability. Random antiterrorism measures execution shall be broad based and involve all units and personnel. Antiterrorism officers are required to monitor, track, and analyze random antiterrorism measures implementation efforts. Installation commanders will develop procedures to ensure random antiterrorism measures are being conducted and reported to the Antiterrorism officers.</p>
	<p class="block_18">19.18. General Antiterrorism Personal Protection.</p>
	<p class="block_8">Always keep a low profile and avoid publicity. Avoid going out in large groups; be unpredictable. Vary daily routines to and from home and work. Be alert for anything suspicious or out of place. Avoid giving unnecessary personal details to anyone unless their identity can be verified. Be alert to strangers who are on government property for no apparent reason. Refuse to meet with strangers outside your workplace. Always advise associates or family members of your destination and anticipated time of arrival when leaving the office or home. Report unsolicited contacts to authorities and do not open doors to strangers. Memorize key telephone numbers. Be cautious about giving out information regarding family travel places or security measures. When overseas, learn and practice a few key phrases in the local language.</p>
	<p class="block_18">19.19. Home and Family Security.</p>
	<p class="block_8">Your spouses and children should always practice basic precautions for their personal security. Familiarize your family with the local terrorist threat, and regularly review protective measures and techniques. Ensure everyone in the family knows what to do in any type of emergency. Restrict the possession of house keys. Lock all entrances at night, including the garage. Keep the house locked, even if you are at home. Destroy all envelopes or other items that show your name, rank, or other personal information. Remove names and rank from mailboxes. Watch for unfamiliar vehicles cruising or parked frequently in the area, particularly if one or more occupants remain in the vehicle for extended periods. </p>
	<p class="block_18">19.20. Telephone Security.</p>
	<p class="block_8">Post emergency telephone numbers on the telephone and preprogram telephone numbers for security forces, local police, fire department, hospitals, and ambulances. Do not answer your telephone with your name and grade. Report all threatening phone calls to security officials and the telephone company. Attempt to ascertain any pertinent information about the caller. For example, background noise, accent, nationality, or location.</p>
	<p class="block_18">19.21. Travel Overseas.</p>
	<p class="block_6">When traveling overseas, travel in small groups and try to be inconspicuous when using public transportation and facilities. Dress, conduct, and mannerisms should not attract attention and be generally similar to that worn by the people in the area. Avoid spontaneous gatherings or demonstrations; stay away from known trouble. Know emergency telephone numbers, local dialing instructions, and ensure family members carry a list of telephone numbers with them at all times.</p>
	<p class="block_3">19.22. Suspicious Packages or Mail.</p>
	<p class="block_6">Look for an unusual or unknown place of origin; no return address; excessive amount of postage; abnormal size or shape; protruding strings; aluminum foil; wires; misspelled words; differing return address and postmark; handwritten labels; unusual odor; unusual or unbalanced weight; springiness in the top or bottom; inflexibility; crease marks; discoloration or oily stains; incorrect titles or title with no name; excessive security material; ticking, beeping, or other sounds; or special instruction markings, such as “personal, rush, do not delay, or confidential” on any packages or mail received. Additionally, be vigilant for evidence of powder or other contaminants. Never cut tape, strings, or other wrappings on a suspect package. If the package has been moved, place the package in a plastic bag to prevent any leakage of contents. If handling mail suspected of containing chemical or biological contaminants, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. Report suspicious mail immediately and make a list of personnel who were in the room when the suspicious envelope or package was identified.</p>
	<p class="block_3">19.23. Ground Transportation Security.</p>
	<p class="block_6">Criminal and terrorist acts against individuals usually occur outside the home and after the victim’s habits have been established. Your most predictable habit is the route you travel from home to your place of duty or to commonly frequented local facilities. Always check for tampering of the interior and exterior of your vehicle before entering the vehicle. Also check the tires and trunk for fingerprints or smudges. If you detect something out of the ordinary, do not touch anything. Immediately contact the local authorities. When overseas, select a plain car. Avoid using government vehicles when possible. Do not display decals with military affiliations and do not openly display military equipment. Keep your doors locked at all times. Do not let someone you do not know direct you to a specific taxi. Ensure taxi is licensed and has safety equipment (seat belts at a minimum). Ensure face of driver and picture on license are the same. Travel with a companion.</p>
	<p class="block_3">19.24. Commercial Air Transportation Security Overseas.</p>
	<p class="block_6">Before traveling overseas, consult the Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide Department of Defense 4500.54-M, available at <a href="https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/" class="text_6">fcg.pentagon.mil</a> to ensure you know and can meet all requirements for travel to a particular country. Get an area of responsibility specific threat briefing from your security officer, antiterrorism officers, or the appropriate counterintelligence or security organization prior to traveling overseas. This briefing is required prior to travel overseas and must occur within 3 months of travel. Use office symbols on orders or leave authorization if the word description denotes a sensitive position. Use military contractor United States flag carriers. Avoid traveling through high-risk areas. Do not use rank or military address on tickets. Do not discuss military affiliation. Have proper identification to show airline and immigration officials. Do not carry classified documents unless absolutely mission essential. Dress conservatively; do not wear distinct military items (wear long-sleeved shirts if you have United States-affiliated tattoos). Carry plain civilian luggage; avoid military-looking bags, or bags with logos or decals.</p>

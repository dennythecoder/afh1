	<p class="block_2">Section 18A—Overview</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.1. Introduction.</p>
	<p class="block_4">This chapter covers the fitness program, proper nutrition, substance abuse, tobacco use, suicide prevention, posttraumatic stress disorder, reintegration from deployment, medical care, and the Wingman concept. Air Force members must be physically fit to support the Air Force mission. Commanders and supervisors must incorporate fitness into the Air Force culture to establish an environment for members to maintain physical fitness and health to meet expeditionary mission requirements and deliver a fit-and-ready force. The annual fitness assessment provides commanders with a tool to assist in the determination of overall fitness of their military personnel.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 18B—Physical Fitness and Fitness Components</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.2. Physical Fitness, Optimal Performance and Mission Readiness.</p>
	<p class="block_5">Adequate physical fitness levels ensure every Airman can properly support the Air Force mission while performing at optimal capacity. The goal of the fitness program is to motivate all members to participate in a year-round physical conditioning program emphasizing total fitness to include proper aerobic conditioning, muscular fitness training, and healthy eating. An active lifestyle will increase productivity, optimize health, and decrease absenteeism while maintaining a higher level of readiness.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.3. Physical Fitness.</p>
	<p class="block_5">The five major components of fitness are cardiorespiratory endurance, body composition, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and flexibility. Warm-up and cool down are also essential components of a complete physical fitness program.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.3.1. Cardiorespiratory endurance is the ability to perform large muscle, dynamic, moderate-to-high intensity exercise for prolonged periods.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.3.2. Body composition is the relative portion of the body comprised of fat and fat-free tissue.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.3.3. Muscular strength is the maximum force generated by a specific muscle or muscle group.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.3.4. Muscular endurance is the ability of a muscle group to execute repeated contractions over a period of sufficient time duration to cause muscular fatigue.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.3.5. Flexibility is the maximum ability to move a joint freely, without pain, through a range of motion.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.4. Aerobic Fitness.</p>
	<p class="block_5">A successful cardiorespiratory endurance exercise program should address modality (type of exercise), volume (frequency multiplied by duration) and intensity.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.4.1. <b class="calibre1">Mode.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Select activities that involve a large proportion of total muscle mass, maximize use of large muscles, (<i class="calibre2">e.g</i>.<i class="calibre2">, </i>muscles around the thigh and hip), involve dynamic, rhythmic muscle contractions, and minimize static (no movement) contraction and use of small muscles. Examples are running, cycling, swimming, rowing, jogging, vigorous walking, indoor aerobic exercise machines, and some sports <i class="calibre2">if</i> they are continuous in nature.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.4.2. <b class="calibre1">Volume (frequency multiplied by duration).</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Accomplish moderately intense aerobic activity 30 minutes a day, five days a week <i class="calibre2">or </i>vigorously intense aerobic activity 20 minutes to 25 minutes a day, 3 days a week <i class="calibre2">and </i>muscle fitness exercise (see below), or an equivalent combination of moderately and vigorously intense aerobic activity. For additional and more extensive health and fitness benefits, accomplish moderately intense aerobic activity 300 minutes (5 hours) a week, or accomplish vigorously intense aerobic activity 150 minutes a week, or an equivalent combination. Generally, the minimal levels of exercise volume and intensity above are necessary to maintain health and fitness, while the higher levels are necessary to improve health and fitness.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.4.3. <b class="calibre1">Intensity.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Intensity refers to how hard one exercises. Moderately intense aerobic activity equates to continuous exercise that raises heart and respiratory rates, initiates sweating (varies with climate), and permits conversation; vigorously intense aerobic activity elicits higher physiological responses and permits light or broken conversation. Intensity, considered the most important variable in training, may be prescribed as a percentage of maximum velocity, or percentages of physiological variables, i.e., a percent of maximal volume of oxygen consumed (%VO<sub class="calibre3">2 </sub>max) or percent of maximal heart rate (%heart rate max). One formula for determining exercise intensity by heart rate is presented in Figure 18.1.</p>

Take an average of the measures.</p><p class="block_8">- Calculate heart rate range.

Applying the equations:</p><p class="block_8">- Minimum exercise heart rate = 50% (120) + 70 = 60 + 70 = 130 beats a minute.</p><p class="block_8">- Optimal exercise heart rate = 75% (120) + 70 = 90 + 70 = 160 beats a minute.</p><p class="block_8">- Do-not-exceed exercise heart rate = 85% (120) + 70 = 102 + 70 = 172 beats/min.</p><p class="block_8">Therefore, this individual should keep exercise heart rate above 130 beats a minute, but below 172 beats a minute, targeting 160 beats a minute for at least 20 minutes to 25 minutes 3 days a week. Unfit individuals should start at the lower end of the heart rate Range. As fitness level increases, the resting heart rate will decrease, therefore increase the intensity percentage from low (50%) towards optimal (75%). Also, base fitness personnel can help fine tune these calculations taking into account medications, risk of injury, and individual preferences and objectives.</p></td>

	<p class="block_9">18.5. Muscular Strength and Endurance Training.</p>
	<p class="block_5">A successful strength and endurance training program should include the principles of specificity, regularity, recovery, balance, and variety.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.5.1. <b class="calibre1">Principle of</b> <b class="calibre1">Specificity.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">A strength training program should provide resistance to specific muscle groups that need to be strengthened. These groups can be identified by doing a simple assessment of functional movement. The Airman slowly does work-related or functional movements he or she wants to improve upon. An example would be the Airman whose job requires them to bend over, pick up an object, and place it in an overhead position. This work-related task has the functional movement of a squat and an overhead press with a weight. By incorporating these moves into a strength training program, the Airman can improve strength and, therefore, improve work-related tasks while reducing injuries by being conditioned in those muscles needed to perform the work. If the Airman’s performance of a task is not adequate, or if he/she wishes to improve, strength training for the identified muscles will be beneficial. In this way, he/she ensures maximum carryover value to his/her warrior tasks.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.5.2. <b class="calibre1">Principle of</b> <b class="calibre1">Regularity.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Exercise must be done regularly to produce a training effect. Sporadic exercise may do more harm than good. Airmen can maintain a moderate level of strength by doing proper strength workouts only once a week for a short period of time if they have already established a strong baseline level of muscular fitness. However, three workouts per week are best for optimal gains. The principle of regularity also applies to the exercises for individual muscle groups. An Airman can work out three times a week, but when different muscle groups are exercised at each workout, the principle of regularity is violated and gains in strength are minimal. Airmen should strive for exercising the same muscle group a minimum of twice each week.</p>
	<p class="block_10"> </p>
	<p class="block_5">18.5.3. <b class="calibre1">Principle of</b> <b class="calibre1">Recovery.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Consecutive days of hard resistance training for the same muscle group can be detrimental. The muscles must be allowed sufficient recovery time to adapt. Strength training may be done every day only if the exercised muscle groups are rotated, so the same muscle or muscle group is not trained (exercised) on consecutive days. There should be at least a 48-hour recovery period between workouts for the same muscle groups. For example, the legs can be trained with weights on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and the upper body muscles on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Recovery is also important within a workout. The recovery time between different exercises and sets depends, in part, on the intensity of the workout. Normally, the recovery time between sets should be 30-180 seconds. </p>
	<p class="block_5">18.5.4. <b class="calibre1">Principle of</b> <b class="calibre1">Balance.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">When developing a strength training program, remember the importance of including exercises to work all the major muscle groups – in both the upper and lower body. You should not work just the muscle groups in the upper body, with the idea running will strengthen the legs. Most muscles are organized into opposing pairs; activating one muscle results in a pulling motion, while activating the opposing muscle results in the opposite or pushing movement. When planning a training session, one training technique is to follow a pushing exercise with a pulling exercise resulting in movement at the same joints. For example, follow an overhead press with a lateral pull-down exercise. This technique helps ensure good strength balance between opposing muscle groups which may, in turn, reduce the risk of injury. Sequence the program to exercise the larger muscle groups first, then the smaller muscles. </p>
	<p class="block_5">18.5.5. <b class="calibre1">Principle of</b> <b class="calibre1">Variety.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Using different equipment, changing the exercises, and altering the volume/intensity are good ways to add variety – and they may also produce better results. The Airmen should periodically substitute different exercises for given muscle groups. For example, Airmen can do squats with a barbell instead of leg presses on a weight machine. Also, for variety or due to necessity (for example, when in the field), they can switch to partner-resisted exercises or another form of resistance training. However, avoid frequent fundamental changes as Airmen may become frustrated if they do not have enough time to adapt or to see improvements in strength.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.6. Flexibility Training:</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.6.1. Flexibility is an important component of any fitness program. Many activity-related injuries have their root in lack of flexibility. Think of muscles as rubber bands. When they are cold, they are rigid and brittle. When warm, they stretch and retract more easily. Conducting a good warm-up before exercising and a good cool down upon completion will help prevent injury and reduce muscle soreness.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.6.2. Regardless of your current fitness level, you should always begin your exercise sessions with a warm-up and end it with a cool down. Recommendations are listed in paragraphs 18.8.1 and 18.8.2. below.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.7. Body Composition.</p>
	<p class="block_5">The two largest contributing factors to maintaining a positive body composition are exercise and diet.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.7.1. A combination of exercise and diet is the best way to lose excessive body fat. Losing 1-2 pounds a week is a realistic goal best accomplished by reducing caloric intake and increasing energy expenditure. In other words, eat less and exercise more. Dieting alone can cause the body to believe the body is being starved. In response, the body tries to conserve its fat reserves by slowing down its metabolic rate and, as a result, loses at a slower rate.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.7.2. Airmen must consume a minimum number of calories from all the major food groups, with the calories distributed over all the daily meals – including snacks and drinks. This ensures an adequate consumption of necessary vitamins and minerals. A male, not under medical supervision, requires a caloric intake of at least 1,500; women require at least 1,200 calories and Airmen should avoid diets failing to meet these criteria.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.7.3. There is no “quick and easy” way to improve body composition. Losing fat safely takes time and patience.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.7.4. Exercise not only burn calories, but helps the body maintain its useful muscle mass and may help keep the body’s metabolic rate high during dieting. Fat is best utilized during aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise, which uses lots of oxygen, is the best type of activity for burning fat. Aerobic exercise includes jogging, walking, swimming, bicycling, cross-country skiing, rowing, stair climbing, and jumping rope. Anaerobic activities, such as sprinting or lifting heavy weights, burn little, if any, fat.</p>
	<p class="block_11"> </p>
	<p class="block_11"> </p>
	<p class="block_3">18.8. Warm-up and Cool Down:</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.8.1. <b class="calibre1">The Warm-up.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Before beginning any vigorous physical activity, you should prepare your body for exercise. The dynamic warm-up increases the flow of blood to the muscles and tendons, thus helping reduce the risk of injury and increasing the joint’s range of motion and positively affects the speed of muscular contraction. The following is the recommended sequence of dynamic warm-up activities for 5-7 minutes before vigorous exercise:</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.8.1.1. Slowly jog in place or walk for 1-2 minutes. This causes a gradual increase in the heart rate, blood pressure, circulation, and increases the temperature of the active muscles.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.8.1.2. Slowly rotate joints (for example, arm circles, knee and ankle rotations) to gradually increase their range of motion; work each major joint for 5-10 seconds.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.8.1.3. Slowly mimic the activities to be performed. For example, lift a lighter weight to warm up before lifting the heavier one; this helps prepare the neuromuscular pathways. The dynamic warm-up increases the flow of blood to the muscles and tendons, helping reduce the risk of injury, increasing the joint’s range of motion, and positively affects the speed of muscular contraction.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.8.2. <b class="calibre1">Cool Down.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">18.8.2.1. Do not stop suddenly after vigorous exercise, but gradually bring your body back to a resting state by slowly decreasing the intensity of the activity. After running, for example, you should walk for 1-2 minutes. Stopping exercise suddenly can cause blood to pool in the muscles, thereby reducing blood flow to the heart and brain. This may cause fainting or abnormal heart rhythm and this could lead to serious complications.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.8.2.2. Repeat the stretches done in your warm-up to help ease muscle tension and any immediate feeling of muscle soreness; be careful not to ‘over-stretch’. The muscles are warm from activity and could be over-stretched to the point of injury.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.8.2.3. Hold stretches 15-30 seconds or more during your cool down to improve flexibility.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.8.2.4. Do not limit flexibility training to the cool down periods. Stretching is one form of exercise that takes very little time relative to the benefits gained and may be done easily at home or work. Repetitive movements at work or having a more sedentary job can increase tension in specific muscle groups, which would benefit from mild stretching during the course of the day.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.9. Unit Physical Fitness Training Program:</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.9.1. Commander-driven physical fitness training is the backbone of the Air Force physical fitness program. The program promotes aerobic and muscular fitness, flexibility, and optimal body composition of each Airman in the unit. Safety must be an overarching concern throughout physical training and assessment.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.9.2. The program will meet the current ability level of the members while encouraging and challenging members to progress to a higher fitness level. The 1.5-mile timed run, 2-kilometer walk, abdominal circumference, push-up, and sit-up assessments are designed to measure the effectiveness of the physical training program. However, training should not be limited to the assessment activities.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.9.3. The unit fitness program will incorporate the guidelines established in AFI 36-2905, <i class="calibre2">Fitness Program</i>, to develop general fitness, prevent boredom, and decrease repetitive strain injuries. Finally, the program must ensure a safe environment for training by assessing traffic patterns, use of headphones or other personal equipment, temperature, availability of water and first aid, and awareness of emergency procedures. In addition, you should consider individual safety issues, such as medical limitations and level of ability.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.10. Physical Fitness Standard:</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.10.1. The Air Force uses a composite fitness score based on aerobic fitness, muscular strength/endurance, and body composition (using abdominal circumference measurements) to determine overall fitness. Overall fitness is directly related to health risk, including risk of disease (morbidity) and death (mortality). A composite score of 75 or greater, in addition to meeting the minimum component scores, represents the minimum accepted for health, fitness, and readiness levels. Health and readiness benefits continue to increase as body composition improves and physical activity and fitness levels increase. Members are encouraged to optimize their readiness status and posture by improving their overall fitness. Age and gender-specific fitness score charts are provided in AFI 36-2905, Attachment 10. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b> Meeting the minimum component scores does not constitute the minimum points required to earn a composite passing score. Scoring the minimum component values in all components will not generate enough points to earn a composite score of 75 or greater. The minimum components are established to ensure members test adequately in all components and avoid “asymmetrical fitness” (i.e. excelling in some and disregarding others).</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.10.2. Airmen will receive a composite score on a 0-100 scale based on the following maximum component scores: 60 points for aerobic fitness assessment, 20 points for body composition, 10 points each for the muscular fitness assessment components, push-ups and sit-ups. Use the following formula to determine the score: composite score = total component points achieved multiplied by 100 and divided by total possible points.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.10.3. Airmen with a medical profile prohibiting them from performing one or more components of the fitness assessment will have a composite score calculated on the tested components.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.10.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Exemptions. </b>Biannually, members must complete a composite fitness assessment. Exemptions are designed to categorize members as unable or unavailable to train or test, for reasons beyond the control of the member or commander, for a limited time period as outlined in AFI 36-2905.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.10.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Component Exemptions.</b> The commander, in consultation with the fitness program manager, may grant members exemption from aerobic and muscle fitness components based on medical recommendation according to AFI 36-2905 for a time-limited period. Other fitness assessment components will still be assessed.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.10.4. Composite scores represent a health-based fitness level. As the fitness level increases, Airmen are able to tolerate extremes in temperature, fatigue, and stress while optimizing performance in the deployed environment. Refer to Table 18.1 for fitness levels.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.10.5. Members must have a current fitness score on file prior to deployment. Member will not be considered “exempt” in the deployed location until their current fitness assessment expires. If a member fails their fitness assessment before deploying and their officer performance report/enlisted performance report closes out after the deployment starts, the commander has the discretion to annotate a non-current/failing fitness assessment within the reporting period on the evaluation. Additionally, the commander has the discretion to document the evaluation as a referral for a non-current/failing fitness assessment at the evaluation close-out date or enlisted performance report static close out date in accordance with AFI 36-2406, <i class="calibre2">Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems</i>. </p>
	<p class="block_5">18.10.6. Any failures will be annotated in Air Force fitness management system and will be considered against the individual. However, if an Airman reaches the 91-day mark after the unsatisfactory fitness assessment, but before the evaluation closes out, the unsatisfactory score is no longer current and the commander has the discretion to annotate a non-current/failing fitness assessment within the reporting period on the evaluation. Additionally, the commander has the discretion to document the evaluation as a referral for a non-current/failing fitness assessment at the evaluation close-out date or enlisted performance report static close out date. For Satisfactory and Excellent scores, deployed Airmen become “exempt” only when they reach the first day of the month, seven/thirteen calendar months following the previous official fitness assessment rating.</p>

	<p class="block_3">18.12. Assessment Procedures.</p>
	<p class="block_5">All components of the fitness assessment must be completed within a 3-hour window on the same day. If extenuating circumstances occur (for example, rapidly changing or severe weather conditions, natural disasters, emergencies, safety issues, etc.), then all components must be completed within 5 duty days. Reserve members must be in a duty status for fitness assessments. The body composition component is the first component of the fitness assessment includes measuring height, weight, and abdominal circumference which must be the first component assessed in the fitness assessment. The muscular fitness components (push-ups and sit-ups) may be accomplished before or after the 1.5-mile run or 2-kilometer walk. There is a minimum 3-minute rest period between components.

	<p class="block_20">Overweight and obesity in the United States has been declared a threat to National Security. Nearly 27% of 17 to 24 year olds are too overweight to serve in the military. The Department of Defense is not immune as 48% of Airmen are assessed as overweight and 14% obese. Imbalance of calorie intake and physical activity are the primary causes for unintended weight gain and an increase potential health risk. Airmen are responsible to be mission ready at all times and must recognize that food is the fuel that supports our performance and ability to complete the mission. To understand how nutrition affects the body, Airmen must understand the following basic concepts: calories, the functions of nutrients, and how to customize nutrient intake to support performance. </p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_4">The United States Department of Agriculture’s MyPlate food guidance system (Figure 18.2) provides practical information to help individuals build healthier diets. MyPlate emphasizes fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods, and dairy groups in appropriate portions. The United States Department of Agriculture’s website, </span><a href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov" class="text_5">www.choosemyplate.gov</a><span class="text_4"> has user-friendly tools and resources on topics such as weight management and calories, physical activity, tracking your diet and healthy eating tips.</span></p>
	<p class="block_5">18.15.2.<b class="calibre1"> Calorie Intake. </b></p>
	<p class="block_6">18.15.2.1. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans summarizes and synthesizes knowledge about individual nutrients and food into a set of recommendations for healthy eating. The 2015 version provides recommendations under 5 main messages; (1) Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan; (2) Focus on variety, nutrient density, and amount; (3) Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake; (4) Shift to healthier food and beverage choices; (5) Support healthy eating patterns for all. </p>
	<p class="block_6">18.15.2.2. Maintaining a healthy weight is key to Airmen’s’ health and readiness. The Air Force recognizes abdominal circumference as one of the most specific indicators of disease risk in adults because abdominal fat is a predictor of obesity-related diseases. In addition to meeting military appearance standards, overweight and obese Airmen have increased risk of high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, arthritis, breathing problems and certain types of cancer. Gradual improvements in diet, physical activity and lifestyle are easier to incorporate and more likely to be maintained. This can be achieved by following the key dietary guideline recommendations to consume a healthy eating pattern that accounts for all foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie level. A healthy eating pattern includes: a variety of vegetables from all the subgroups- dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans and peas), starchy, and other; fruits, especially whole fruits; grains, at least half of which are whole grains; fat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and/or fortified soy beverages; a variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), and nuts, seeds and soy products; oils. </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_4">18.15.2.3. Maintaining a healthy energy balance is important. Calories from foods and beverages need to be balanced with calories burned through metabolism and physical activity to meet weight goals—less calories to lose weight, balanced calories to maintain weight and more calories to gain weight. If weight loss is desired, creating a calorie deficit of 500-1000 calories a day through diet and/or exercise should lead to a healthy weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week.

	<p class="block_6">18.15.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Macronutrients. </b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Macronutrients make up the bulk of the diet and supply energy as well as many essential nutrients. Carbohydrates and protein provide 4 calories per gram and fats provide 9 calories per gram. </p>
	<p class="block_6">18.15.2.4.1. <b class="calibre1">Carbohydrates. </b></p>
	<p class="block_6">18.15.2.4.1.1. Carbohydrates are the primary fuel source your body uses during exercise. An appropriate amount of carbohydrates is important to maintain glycogen stores for energy reserve. Carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels and supply energy. Simple carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels rapidly while complex carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels slowly over a longer time. Simple carbohydrates are often found in packaged or processed foods, examples are; table sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, honey, fruit drinks, soft drinks and candy. Added sugars are simple sugars added to foods or beverages when they are processed or prepared and should account for less than 10% of calories per day. Complex carbohydrates can be found in fruits, breads, cereals, grains, milk and starchy vegetables (potatoes, corn, peas, and squash). Healthy carbohydrates contain fiber and whole grains and limited added sugars. The recommended serving size is about the size of the palm of your hand and contains approximately 15 grams of carbohydrate; sizes differ with sweets and vegetables. The general recommendation for carbohydrate intake is 45-65% of total calories. </p>
	<p class="block_6">18.15.2.4.1.2. Fiber is classified as soluble or insoluble. Soluble fiber attracts water and turns to gel during digestion. Therefore, soluble fiber lowers low-density lipoprotein/bad cholesterol and prolongs stomach emptying time so sugar is released and absorbed more slowly. Additionally, fiber can be found in oatmeal, oat bran, nuts and seeds, dry beans and peas, and most fruits. Insoluble fiber adds bulk to the stool and helps food pass more quickly through the stomach and intestines. Finally, fiber can be found in whole wheat bread, barley, brown rice, seeds, and in most vegetables and fruits. The average American consumes 12-15 grams per day, whereas the recommended total fiber intake is 20-35 grams per day.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.15.2.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> Protein. </b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Proteins are used by our bodies for tissue maintenance, replacement, function and growth of our muscles. If our body is not getting enough calories from dietary sources or tissue stores, protein may be used for energy. The general recommendation for protein intake is 10-35% of total calories or 0.8 to 1.2 grams/kilograms body weight to meet daily needs. Protein can be found in meats, poultry, fish, legumes, tofu, eggs, nuts and seeds, milk and milk products, and grains. Individuals should focus on lean meats and low fat milk products to reduce saturated fats. The recommended serving size of meat is the size of a deck of cards and contains about 21 grams of protein. One 8 ounce glass of milk contains 8 grams of protein. </p>

	<p class="block_6">18.15.2.4.<b class="calibre1"> Fats. </b></p>
	<p class="block_6">18.15.2.4.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Fats are a major energy source and help our bodies maintain temperature and protect organs from trauma. Balanced fat intake is essential to maintain energy reserve. Fats can be found in oils, high fat cuts of meat, baked sweets, whole-fat milk and cream, butter, cheeses, nuts and seeds, avocados, and fish. The general recommendation for fats is 20-35% of total calories. The differences between the four categories of fats are important to understand; saturated fats, trans fats, polyunsaturated fats, and monounsaturated fats.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.15.2.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Diets higher in saturated fats have been linked to coronary heart disease. Saturated fats should make up less than 10% of your daily calories, foods that contain more saturated fats are usually solid at room temperate and can be found in high-fat cheeses, high-fat cuts of meat, whole-fat milk and cream, butter, ice cream, and palm and coconut oils.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.15.2.4.3. Trans fats have also been linked to coronary heart disease and intake of these fats should be kept as low as possible. They can be found in small amounts in the fatty parts of meat and milk products and in foods that contain partially hydrogenated oils. Trans fats can be made from vegetable oils through a process called hydrogenation and are found in foods such as frozen pizzas, frozen pies, cookies, and margarine, spreads and other processed foods.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.15.2.4.4.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Eating more unsaturated fan can reduce your risk for heart disease and improve high-density lipoprotein/good cholesterol levels.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Unsaturated fats are typically liquid at room temperature and include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats typically come from plant sources such as canola oil, olive oil, nuts, seeds, flaxseed, and avocado but is also present in fish such as trout, herring, and salmon. </p>
	<p class="block_6">18.15.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Sodium. </b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Americans consume about 3,400 milligrams of sodium every day, mostly in the form of salt found in processed foods- canned foods, soups, cheese, bread, prepared mixes and deli meats. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults limit their sodium intake to 2,300 mg per day-about the amount in one teaspoon of table salt. Certain “at-risk” groups including adults over the age of 51, African Americans, and people who have high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney disease should limit their sodium intake to about 1,500 milligrams per day. High sodium intake raises blood pressure which is a major risk factor for the nation’s leading cause of death – heart disease. The best way to ensure a low sodium diet is to eat whole foods such as fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables; lean, unprocessed poultry and fish; unsalted nuts; whole grains; and low-fat dairy products such as skim milk or yogurt. </p>
	<p class="block_6">18.15.2.6. <b class="calibre1">Fluid. </b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Water is essential for life, in fact the body is made up of over 60% water. Water has no calories and is needed to transport nutrients throughout your body via blood plasma, while also assisting many of your body’s other functions, including waste elimination. Depending on age, sex, race, and body composition water needs differ. The exact percentage is different for males and females and from one person to another with a range of 45-75%. Taking these factors into account, daily water balance for each individual also depends on the total difference between water gain and water loss. Water gains occur from consumption of liquids, foods, and the body’s natural production of water. Water losses occur from the following sources: sweat, respiration, gastrointestinal, and renal. The body is in constant demand for water and this demand increases when you exercise, when you are ill, and in environmental conditions, such as humidity and altitude. For a generally healthy individual, the Dietary Reference Intakes, recommend a total daily water consumption (combination of drinking water, beverages, and food) for women, 19-70 years of age, as 2.7 liters per day and for men, 19-70 years of age, as 3.7 liters per day. </p>
	<p class="block_23">18.15.2.7. <b class="calibre1">Caffeine.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Caffeine is a stimulant present in a variety of products including coffee, tea, colas, energy drinks, dietary supplements, over-the-counter medications, and some foods. According to the Human Performance Resource Center, daily caffeine intake up to 400 mg has been found safe for healthy adults and non-pregnant/non-lactating women. Caffeine used in moderation with a dose of up to 200 mg has been shown to improve cognitive performance in individuals. A cup of coffee typically has 100 mg of caffeine. Be aware that taking large doses of caffeine, roughly 400–500 mg, at one time can result in a serious condition known as “caffeine intoxication.” Symptoms of caffeine intoxication can include nausea, vomiting, agitation, nervousness, or headache. Excessive caffeine intake can be life-threatening and could potentially cause electrolyte imbalance or high levels of acid in the blood which could cause seizures.</p>

	<p class="block_24"><span class="text_7">18.15.2.8. </span><span class="text_8">Energy Drinks </span><span class="text_9">versus Sport Drinks.</span><span class="text_8"> </span></p>
	<p class="block_6">Energy drinks and sports drinks are both marketed by manufacturers to improve performance. Evidence as to the effect of energy drinks on athletic performance is inconsistent. Be aware, case studies have reported seizures after heavy consumption of energy drinks. Energy drinks usually carry a “warning” due to the use of stimulants such as caffeine, green tea extract, guarana seed extract, yerba mate, acacia rigidula, taurine, ginseng or other proprietary “energy boost blends.” Proprietary blends can contain novel, untested ingredients, along with botanicals, amino acids, proteins, peptides, or extracts. Additionally, vitamins and minerals (e.g. B-vitamins and magnesium) may be added, leading to excessive intakes. Energy drinks are not meant to hydrate. Sports drinks, or carbohydrate-electrolyte beverages, are designed to hydrate and do not contain caffeine unless otherwise stated. Sports drinks generally contain a mixture of carbohydrates (14 to 19 grams per 8-ounce serving), sodium (115-175 mg per 8-ounce serving), and potassium (20-98 milligrams per 8-ounce serving) which has been shown to improve exercise performance. If eight liters of sweat are lost per day or higher intensity exercise lasts greater than 60 minutes, a carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage may be needed. In conclusion, the safest solution is to avoid energy supplements and learn more about electrolytes and carbohydrate fueling strategies to decide which sport drink (not energy drink) is the best choice for you.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.15.2.9. <b class="calibre1">Alcohol. </b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Excessive drinking can be harmful to your health and may increase the risk for high blood pressure, liver cirrhosis and several forms of cancer. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans advise limiting alcohol<span class="calibre6"> to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. The serving size for beer is 12 ounces, wine is 5 ounces and 80 proof distilled spirits is 1.5 ounces. The average serving of alcohol generally has about 150 calories. Additionally, alcohol has 7 calories per gram and can be a significant contributor caloric consumption in the diet. Alcohol may lead to excess weight gain, increased risk for chronic diseases, osteoporosis, stress injuries, and impaired short and long term cognitive function.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_5">18.15.3.<b class="calibre1"> Performance Nutrition Basics. </b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Nutrition plays an important role in maintaining health and<span class="calibre6"> performance, particularly exercise. This next section builds upon the basic nutrition principles and focuses on fueling strategies that will help enhance and optimize physical performance. The basics of performance nutrition focus on fluid hydration and timing of fueling strategies (before, during, and after exercise).    </span></p>
	<p class="block_23">18.15.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Fluid Requirements with Exercise.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Exercise substantially increases fluid loss, placing greater demands on fluid replacement; so that proper hydration before, during, and after intense workouts is critical. Decrements in performance starts to occur with fluid losses of 2% of body weight degrades both cognitive and mental performance. One liter of water is equivalent to 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight. An example would be a 150 pound individual losing 3 pounds of body weight through sweat losses which would equate to 1.36 liters of fluid. During exercise, sweat rate losses can vary from 0.3-2.4 liters. Fluid losses are dependent on exercise intensity, genetic predisposition, fitness status, acclimation of heat, altitude, clothing, and other environmental conditions. Dehydration occurs with fluid losses of greater than 2% of body weight and increases risk for heat illness, exhaustion and stroke. In general, for activities less than 60 minutes, water is the best beverage for hydration. If you are doing more than 60 minutes of continuous exercise, then you may benefit from a sports drink to replace electrolytes and carbohydrates. Also know that a while dehydration can affect performance and be life threatening, the same can occur on the opposite end of the spectrum with excess fluid consumption. Excess fluid can lead to over-hydration resulting in symptoms such as chills, vomiting, dizziness, disorientation, altered mental status, fatigue, headache, and even death. According to the United States Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, regardless of how hot it is or how hard you are working, you should limit fluids to no more than 6 cups an hour and 48 cups a day. The key with fluid intake is to aim to replace losses and monitor signs and symptoms of under/over hydration. Determine how much water is lost by taking a weight measurement (without clothes/gear) before and after a hard training workout. Drink 16 ounces of fluid for every pound of weight lost.</p>
	<p class="block_23">18.15.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Pre-, During, and Post-event Eating Strategies.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6"><span class="calibre6">Following appropriate eating strategies based on event timing and exercise intensity can help improve performance.  Avoid drastic changes in diet before a fitness test or mission; try out new foods and strategies during training times.</span></p>
	<p class="block_6">18.15.3.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Pre-exercise: </b>The purpose of a pre-exercise beverage, snack or meal is to provide enough fluid to maintain hydration and enough carbohydrates to maintain proper blood sugar levels during activity. A pre-exercise meal (includes some carbs, protein and low or moderate fat) should be consumed 3 to 4 hours before starting the activity. This allows time for the body to digest the food. A small amount of protein before exercise may reduce muscle soreness later. Pre-exercise snacks/beverages should be consumed 30 to 60 minutes before an activity. The snacks and beverages consumed one hour before should contain mainly carbohydrates since they are digested quickly and turned to energy-giving glucose. Snack examples are bananas or other fruits (grapes, applesauce, and peaches), graham crackers, pretzels, or low fiber dry cereal. Avoid foods with fat and fiber in a pre-exercise snack to minimize possibility of an upset stomach.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.15.3.2.2. <b class="calibre1">During Exercise: </b><span class="calibre6">During exercise duration of less than 45 minutes, carbohydrate consumption is not warranted. In sustained high intensity exercise with a duration of 45-75 minutes, small amounts of carbohydrates during activity (sports drinks and products) may enhance performance, but does not provide a source of fuel. During endurance exercise of 1-2.5 hours in length, carbohydrate intake provides a source of fuel. The recommended intake of carbohydrates for events 1-2.5 hours in length is 30-60 grams per hour. In ultra-endurance events, greater than 2.5-3 hours in length, carbohydrate intakes of up to 90 grams per hour can improve performance.   </span></p>
	<p class="block_25">18.15.3.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Post-exercise/Recovery: </b>If exercising at a low or moderate intensity for less than a half hour a post workout beverage or snack is not necessary. However, if the exercise routine is rigorous and lasts for more than 45 minutes, a snack or light meal will help in recovery. This “recovery” meal helps replenish the carbohydrates burned during exercise and converts them into a storage form (glycogen) for later use. Adding protein to the meal or snack helps rebuild muscle tears that occur during exercise. Following exhaustive exercise a minimum of 24 hours is required to replace the glycogen stores lost in training. Timing and the ratio of carbohydrate to protein are also important factors to consider. The critical window of refueling is within 45 minutes of finishing your exercise. High glycemic foods are the most effective for restoring glycogen. An optimal composition of a post recovery beverage or snack is a 4:1 carbohydrate to protein ratio. This means that for every 4 grams of carbohydrates there should be 1 gram of protein. A great example is the recovery beverage chocolate milk. A regular 8 ounce glass of chocolate milk contains about 29 grams of carbohydrates and 8 grams of protein, a 3.6:1 carbohydrate/protein ratio. In contrast, a regular 8 ounce glass of milk contains 12 grams of carbohydrates and 8 grams of protein, a 1.5:1 carbohydrate/protein ratio. Other examples of simple post-workout snacks include low fat yogurt, trail mix (cereal, nuts and dried fruit) and water, or string cheese and a fruit bar with water. Hydration repletion should also be a priority. Recovery fluids should include sodium and potassium. Examples of these types of fluids are: water, juices, sports beverages, coffee, tea, soups, and water containing foods such as fruits and vegetables.</p>
	<p class="block_23">18.15.3.3.<b class="calibre1"> Supplements.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">18.15.3.3.1. The use of dietary supplements continues to be popular among members of the military. The term dietary supplement includes many products, such as vitamins, minerals, herbs, botanicals, amino acids, or other substances, and are sold as pills, powders, bars, packs, gels, drinks, or shakes. The Food and Drug Administration does not test products before they are sold in stores or via the internet; this lack of oversight means there is no guarantee that what you purchase is what you get. Knowing the “red flags” when choosing a dietary supplement is important. First, be aware that the most popular types of supplements- bodybuilding, performance enhancement, sexual enhancement, and weight loss products, are the ones most likely to be “tainted” with prescription drugs, heavy metals, or other undeclared ingredients. Second, avoid products that have ingredients listed as “blends,” “proprietary blends,” or “delivery systems” on the label. These blends do not specify the amount of each ingredient in the blend and increase the risk of overdosing on ingredients such as creatine or caffeine. Third, be wary of products that promise a “quick fix” or amazing results that seem too good to be true. Fortunately, there are third party verification/certification companies that will test the purity and/or quality of the product, so look for those types of labels on your products (Figure 18.3). Remember, climate and stress may alter the effects of dietary supplements, especially in a deployed environment which can increase the risk of having a bad reaction to a product.</p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_4">18.15.3.3.2. The Department of Defense has created a resource called the Operation Supplement Safety campaign, which is designed to educate the military community about dietary supplements and how to choose supplements wisely.

	<p class="block_5">18.16.1. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Drug Demand Reduction programs include substance use/misuse prevention, education, treatment, and urinalysis testing. Substance use/misuse prevention and treatment policies and programs are thoroughly integrated into every facet of Air Force core values, quality of life, and force management. These policies have been in place for over two decades and have evolved to meet changing conditions within the Air Force. Our members are held to the highest standards of discipline and behavior, both on and off duty. Individuals who experience problems related to substance use/misuse will receive counseling and treatment as needed; however, all Air Force members are held accountable for unacceptable behavior.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.16.2. The Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program objectives are to promote readiness, health, and wellness through the prevention and treatment of substance misuse and abuse; minimize the negative consequences of substance misuse and abuse to the individual, family, and organization; provide comprehensive education and treatment to individuals who experience problems attributed to substance misuse or abuse, to restore function and return identified substance abusers to unrestricted duty status or assist them in their transition to civilian life.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.17. Policy on Drug Abuse:</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.17.1. Department of Defense policy is to prevent and eliminate drug and alcohol abuse and dependence from the Department of Defense. Such abuse and dependence are incompatible with readiness, the maintenance of high standards of performance, and military discipline.

To ensure military readiness, safeguard the health and wellness of the force, and to maintain good order and discipline in the Service, the knowing use of any intoxicating substance, other than the lawful use of alcohol or nicotine products, that is inhaled, injected, consumed, or introduced into the body in any manner to alter mood or function, is prohibited. These substances include, but are not limited to, controlled substance analogues (for example, designer drugs such as “spice” that are not otherwise controlled substances); inhalants, propellants, solvents, household chemicals, and other substances used for “huffing;” prescription or over-the-counter medications when used in a manner contrary to their intended medical purpose or in excess of the prescribed dosage; and naturally occurring intoxicating substances (for example, Salvia divinorum). The possession of any intoxicating substance described in this paragraph, if done with the intent to use in a manner that would alter mood or function, is prohibited. Failure by military personnel to comply with the prohibitions contained in this paragraph is a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p>

Do not use these signs to make a conclusive substance use diagnosis. This responsibility lies with the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program personnel. If any of these signs are present, it may suggest a potential problem exists for the member. Talk with the member and explain why you are concerned. Fear of discussing concerns is normal, but discussing the concern is important to address the concern early before the problem gets out of control. Document and discuss specific instances of unusual behavior with the supervisor, first sergeant, or unit commander. This will help expedite the care a subordinate may need.

	<p class="block_27">18.19.2. <b class="calibre1">Identifying Individuals with Substance use Disorders or Misuse.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">For the Air Force to have an effective substance use prevention and treatment program, there must be a means of identifying service members experiencing problems with substance use. Although commanders play a major role in identifying substance abusers, members should be aware of how commanders must proceed in various circumstances. Due to the nature of the position noncommissioned officers hold within the unit, they also play an important part in the identification process. There are basically five identification methods:</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.19.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Medical Care Referrals. </b>Medical personnel must notify the unit commander and the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment program manager when a member:</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.19.2.1.1. Is observed, identified, or suspected to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol while seeking medical care.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.19.2.1.2. Receives treatment for an injury or illness that may be the result of substance use/misuse.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.19.2.1.3. Is suspected of abusing substances.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.19.2.1.4. Is admitted as a patient for alcohol or drug detoxification.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.19.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Commander’s Identification.</b> Unit commanders will refer all service members for assessment when substance use or misuse is suspected to be a contributing factor in any misconduct; for example, driving under the influence, public intoxication, drunk and disorderly, spouse or child abuse and maltreatment, underage drinking, positive drug test, or when notified by medical personnel. When commanders or supervisors fail to refer a member with suspected or identified substance use problems, this places the member at increased risk for developing more severe substance use problems and may jeopardize the safety of others and ultimately mission accomplishment.</p>
	<p class="block_6"><span class="text_1">18.19.2.3. </span><span class="text_2">Drug Testing. </span><span class="text_1">The Air Force conducts drug testing of personnel according to AFI 90-507, </span><span class="text_11">Military Drug Demand Reduction Program</span><span class="text_1">.</span><span class="text_11"> </span><span class="text_1">Drug testing is most effective as a deterrent. Therefore, Air Force military members are subject to testing regardless of grade, status, or position. Inspection testing is the best deterrent presently available against drug abuse. Military members may receive an order or voluntarily consent to provide urine samples at any time. Military members who fail to comply with an order to provide a urine sample are subject to punitive action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Commander-directed testing should only be used as a last resort because the results cannot be used in actions under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, </span><span class="text_1">or </span><span class="text_1">administrative actions, including adverse characterization of administrative discharges such as (General) or under other than honorable conditions.</span></p>
	<p class="block_6">18.19.2.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Inspection under Military Rule of Evidence 313. </b>Inspection testing is the most common method of testing in the Air Force. Drug testing is random and unpredictable. In general, an inspection is an examination conducted as an incident of command, the primary purpose of which is to determine and ensure the security, military fitness, or good order and discipline of the unit, organization, or installation. Individuals are selected at random using a nonbiased selection process. Commanders may also select work sections, units, or segments of the military population to provide urine samples. Commanders may use the positive result of a urine sample to refer a member for a substance use evaluation, as evidence to support disciplinary action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or administrative discharge action, and as a consideration on the issue of characterization of discharge in administrative discharges.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.19.2.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Probable Cause. </b>Probable cause<b class="calibre1"> </b>requires a search and seizure authorization from the appropriate commander to seize a urine specimen. Probable cause exists when there is a reasonable belief that drugs will be found in the system of the member to be tested. Consult with the staff judge advocate regarding procedures for determining whether probable cause exists. Results may be used for Uniform Code of Military Justice or to characterize administrative discharges.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.19.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Medical Purposes. </b>Results of any examination conducted for a valid medical purpose including emergency medical treatment, periodic physical examination, and other such examinations necessary for diagnostic or treatment purposes may be used to identify drug abusers. Results may be used as evidence to support disciplinary action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or administrative discharge action according to AFI 90-507, Table 7.1. These results may also be considered on the issue of characterization of discharge in separation proceedings.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.19.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Self-identification. </b>Air Force members with substance use problems are encouraged to seek assistance from the unit commander, first sergeant, substance use counselor, or a military medical professional. Self-identification is reserved for members who are not currently under investigation or pending action because of an alcohol-related incident. Following the assessment, the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment program manager will consult with the treatment team and determine an appropriate clinical course of action.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.19.2.5.1. <b class="calibre1">Drugs.</b> An Air Force member may voluntarily disclose evidence of personal drug use or possession to the unit commander, first sergeant, substance use counselor, or a military medical professional. Commanders will grant limited protection for Air Force members who reveal this information with the intention of entering treatment. Commanders may not use voluntary disclosure against a member in an action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or when weighing characterization of service in a separation. Disclosure is not voluntary if the Air Force member has previously been:</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.19.2.5.1.1. Apprehended for drug involvement.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.19.2.5.1.2. Placed under investigation for drug abuse. The day and time when a member is considered placed under investigation is determined by the circumstances of each individual case. A member is under investigation, for example, when an entry is made in the security forces blotter, when the security forces investigator’s log shows an initial case entry, or when the Air Force Office of Special Investigations opens a case file. Furthermore, a member is considered under investigation when he or she has been questioned about drug use by investigative authorities or the member’s commander, or when an allegation of drug use has been made against the member.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.19.2.5.1.3. Ordered to give a urine sample as part of the drug-testing program in which the results are still pending or have been returned as positive.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.19.2.5.1.4. Advised of a recommendation for administrative separation for drug abuse.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.19.2.5.1.5. Entered into treatment for drug abuse.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.19.2.5.2. <b class="calibre1">Alcohol.</b> Commanders must provide sufficient incentive to encourage members to seek help for problems with alcohol without fear of negative consequences. Self-identified members will enter the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment assessment process and will be held to the same standards as others entering substance use education, counseling, and treatment programs.</p>
	<p class="block_10"> </p>
	<p class="block_10"> </p>
	<p class="block_3">18.20. Leadership Responsibilities.</p>
	<p class="block_5">The supervisor’s role in the treatment process does not end with identifying and referring members. Though the supervisor is not charged with providing treatment, daily interaction with his or her personnel and the treatment team can have a significant impact on the success of the treatment efforts. Identifying individuals who need treatment is a critical first step in helping them break free of the tremendously potent cycle of denial, negativity, and increased substance use. However, entering treatment is only a first step. A member’s substance use problem did not develop overnight and took time, as will treatment and recovery. The supervisor must remain focused on the member’s duty performance, attendance in the program, and maintenance of standards. One of the most critical components to a member’s treatment is the treatment team meeting. Commander and/or first sergeant and supervisor involvement in the treatment team meeting at key points in the patient’s treatment and recovery are important. The commander or first sergeant and the supervisor must be involved at program entry, termination, and anytime there are significant treatment difficulties with the patient. The primary objective of the treatment team is to guide the clinical course of the patient’s treatment after examining all the facts. The treatment team consists of the commander, supervisor, member’s counselor, medical consultants, other appropriate helping agencies, and the member.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.21. Substance Use Assessment.</p>
	<p class="block_5">The central purpose of the substance use assessment is to determine the patient’s need for treatment and level of care required. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment staff members conduct the substance use assessment within seven calendar days of notification. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment program managers conduct required reviews of the patient’s medical records and all documentation provided by the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment staff on a priority basis. Information gathered during the assessment will form the basis for patient diagnosis, treatment planning, and delivery of substance use services.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.22. Substance Use Treatment.</p>
	<p class="block_5">Substance use treatment is divided into two services: nonclinical and clinical.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.22.1. <b class="calibre1">Nonclinical Services.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">All active duty members involved in alcohol-related misconduct will be referred for a substance use assessment. Members who do not meet diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder will receive alcohol counseling targeted (secondary) prevention and education. All decisions about length and number of visits of targeted prevention and education will be based on thorough assessment and determination of risk and is tailored for the individual. There will be at least two follow-up appointments of a minimum of 30 minutes duration to reassess risk, assess progress, and as appropriate, conduct a follow-up review of the educational components. If the client is assessed to need more services, there should be follow-ups with progress updates depending on the client’s needs. The focus of these appointments is not treatment. They are designed to be targeted (individual) prevention, education, and reassessment. In addition to the initial assessment, a required alcohol education module will be completed within 2 weeks following the assessment. The alcohol education module includes information on Air Force policy, understanding the relationship between consumption, metabolism and intoxication, and physiological effects of alcohol on brain and body.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.22.1.1. Additional counseling addressing bio-psychosocial issues identified in the assessment may be prescribed. Length of involvement will be determined based on the patient’s presenting problems and agreed-upon treatment or behavioral contract.</p>
	<p class="block_6"><span class="text_1">18.22.1.2. Individuals being processed for separation are provided appropriate medical care </span><span class="text_1">(e.g., detoxification) </span><span class="text_1">before separation. Separation action is not postponed because of a member’s participation in the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program.</span></p>
	<p class="block_5">18.22.2. <b class="calibre1">Clinical Services:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">18.22.2.1. Patients meeting the Diagnostic Statistical Manual 5 diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder will be entered into substance use treatment with the level and intensity of care determined by the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment program manager using current American Society of Addiction Medicine criteria. The philosophy is to place personnel with substance use problems in the least intensive or restrictive treatment environment possible appropriate to their therapeutic needs.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.22.2.2. Depending on the member’s needs, variable lengths of stay or duration of treatment are provided within an array of treatment settings. The treatment program will reflect a multidisciplinary approach to assist the patient to achieve full recovery, free of the negative effect of the substance use. Treatment plans are individually tailored to meet patient’s needs. Family involvement is strongly encouraged.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.22.2.3. Individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder<i class="calibre2"> </i>will refrain from the use of alcohol during the initial phase of treatment and are strongly encouraged to continue to abstain during aftercare. Total abstinence is a critical treatment goal; however, because of the nature of alcoholism, relapses into drinking behavior are not uncommon and should be anticipated. A relapse by itself is not sufficient reason for program failure; however, relapses must be considered a significant threat to the patient’s treatment and dealt with appropriately.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.22.2.4. Involvement in self-help recovery groups (such as 12-step, rational recovery) is encouraged as an adjunct to treatment. The frequency of attendance is determined by the treatment team with the patient.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.23. Detoxification Prior to Treatment.</p>
	<p class="block_5">Patients being referred for inpatient treatment will be assessed to determine the level of detoxification services required. To the greatest extent possible, patient detoxification will be managed on an outpatient basis prior to inpatient treatment. Patients assessed as requiring medically managed detoxification (inpatient) will be entered into an appropriate medical facility.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.24. Completing the Program:</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.24.1. <b class="calibre1">Successful Completion.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Patients will not be considered to have successfully completed treatment until they meet the Diagnostic Statistical Manual criteria for early full remission. Based on Diagnostic Statistical Manual criteria, the treatment team determines patient progress toward agreed-upon goals and issues as stated in the treatment plan and determines when the patient is effectively in recovery and no longer requires program resources.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.24.2. <b class="calibre1">Failing the Program:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">18.24.2.1. The treatment team determines a patient to have failed the program based on a demonstrated pattern of unacceptable behavior, inability, or unwillingness to comply with their treatment plan, or involvement in alcohol or drug-related incidents after receiving initial treatment. The determination a patient has failed treatment is based on the patient’s repeated failure to meet and maintain Air Force standards (behavior), rather than solely on the use of alcohol. An individual who has failed the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program will be considered for administrative separation by his or her commander.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.24.2.2. Decisions regarding aftercare services will be based on a current assessment of status and will include establishment of an aftercare treatment plan identifying specific goals, interventions, and means to assess interventions.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.25. Management of Personnel with Substance use Disorders.</p>
	<p class="block_5">The commander is responsible for all personnel and administrative actions pertaining to patients involved in the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program, to include assignment availability, promotion eligibility, reenlistment eligibility, Personnel Reliability Program, security clearance, etc. Application of administrative restrictions should be based on the establishment of an unfavorable information file or control roster resulting from the member’s unacceptable behavior and not solely based on their involvement in the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.26. The Line of Duty Determination.</p>
	<p class="block_5">A member’s substance use misconduct can lead to a line of duty determination. A line of duty determination is a finding made after an investigation into the circumstances of a member’s illness, injury, disease, or death. The finding concludes: (1) whether or not the illness; injury, or disease existed prior to service and if an existed prior to service condition was aggravated by military service; (2) whether or not the illness, injury, disease, or death occurred while the member was absent from duty; and (3) whether or not the illness, injury, disease, or death was due to the member’s own misconduct. The line of duty determination protects the interests of both the member and the United States Government. A line of duty determination may impact disability retirement and severance pay, forfeiture of pay, period of enlistment, as well as veteran benefits. Additional guidance may be found in AFI 36-2910, <i class="calibre2">Line of Duty (Misconduct) Determination.</i></p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 18E—Tobacco Use</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.27. Air Force Goal for Tobacco Use.</p>
	<p class="block_5">The Air Force’s goal is a tobacco-free force. Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of disease and death in the United States. Every year, in the United States, tobacco use is responsible for about 1 in 5 deaths (at least 480,000 deaths per year, of which an estimated 41,000 of these deaths are from secondhand smoke exposure).</p>
	<p class="block_11"> </p>
	<p class="block_11"> </p>
	<p class="block_3">18.28. Effects of Tobacco Use:</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.28.1. Optimal health and total fitness are force multipliers and critical to the military mission. Tobacco use, including but not limited to cigarettes, cigars, spit tobacco (also known as smokeless tobacco or “chew”), and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), is inconsistent with the Air Force’s goal of a mission-ready, healthy and fit force. Tobacco use affects all bodily systems, not just the mouth and lungs. Some types of cancer, cardiovascular diseases and many types of other diseases, have been linked to tobacco use. For the military member, tobacco use decreases endurance, night vision and fine motor coordination (for example, the coordination needed to hold a weapon steady), increases the risk of injuries (such as fractures) and post-operative respiratory complications, and impairs (or slows) wound healing. Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency classifies tobacco smoke as a class “A” carcinogen. This means smoking causes cancer. Smoking is an obvious cancer threat to the smoker; but, more importantly, it poses a cancer threat to the individual who chooses not to smoke. Tobacco not only harms the user but can also cause cancer or contribute to cardiovascular disease in those who breathe the exhaled smoke called environmental tobacco smoke.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.28.2. While studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health have shown a decline in cigarette smoking, the use of other forms of tobacco has significantly increased. The increased use of smokeless tobacco is based on the faulty assumption of less hazardous. Smokeless tobacco actually contains 28 different cancer-causing agents (carcinogens). Oral cancers affect 30,000 people annually, and one person dies every hour as a result of this disease. The 5-year survival rate is very low. Only 50 percent of persons are alive at 5 years after diagnosis.</p>
	<p class="block_28">18.28.3. Nicotine found in tobacco products is addictive. Nearly one-half of all smokers in the United States have tried to quit in the past year. Because of the powerful physical and psychological addiction, quitting can be a challenge. The longer one uses tobacco, the more difficult cessation can be. Therefore, never using products containing nicotine is the best prevention. The United States Surgeon General has found that nearly 100 percent of adults who smoke every day started smoking when they were 26 years of age or younger, reinforcing prevention in our younger Airmen is critical to reducing tobacco prevalence in the Air Force.</p>
	<p class="block_29">18.29. Cost of Tobacco use to the Air Force.</p>
	<p class="block_28">The significant costs associated with tobacco use are both physical and financial. TRICARE has estimated that tobacco use costs the Department of Defense $1.7 billion annually because of increased healthcare utilization and decreased work productivity (due to smoking breaks and illness). No less significant is the fact that the cost of smoking a pack a day for a year is 1-month’s base pay for an Airman Basic.</p>
	<p class="block_29">18.30. Air Force Standards.</p>
	<p class="block_28">AFI 40-102, <i class="calibre2">Tobacco Use in the Air Force</i>, expands tobacco-free environments. Tobacco use on a military installation is restricted to designated tobacco areas. Tobacco use is prohibited on military treatment facility campuses; within 50 feet of a building entry, sidewalk, or parking lot; within 100 feet of a playground; on all recreational facilities, including athletic complexes, golf courses, and beaches; in all lodging rooms, lodging and unaccompanied housing common areas, and temporary lodging facility units; and family housing if serviced by a common air-handling unit. Installation commanders are authorized to designate all unaccompanied housing as nonsmoking. The Air Force prohibits all students in technical training, accession, and graduate medical education programs from using tobacco products while in duty uniform, and prohibits tobacco use at all times during basic military training. Not using tobacco should be the Air Force norm to promote mission readiness, health, and productivity. Commanders are expected to support Airmen trying to quit tobacco products. Installation health promotion programs provide strategies for education, motivation, and intervention to discourage tobacco use. Formal, structured tobacco cessation programs designed to assist members in breaking the addiction to tobacco products are available.</p>

These civilian networks help enable the Department of Defense to provide beneficiaries with access to high-quality health care services even while uniformed medics are serving abroad in contingency operations. Comprehensive, current information on the TRICARE program can be found at </span><a href="http://www.tricare.mil" class="text_14">www.tricare.mil</a><span class="text_12">. </span></p>
	<p class="block_3">18.35. TRICARE Regions.</p>
	<p class="block_5">TRICARE is available in the United States and overseas locations. Each TRICARE region has a managed care support contractor that administers and coordinates health care services with network and non-network civilian hospitals and providers. </p>
	<p class="block_11"> </p>
	<p class="block_19"><b class="calibre1">18.36.</b> <b class="calibre1">TRICARE Plans.</b></p>
	<p class="block_5">Several TRICARE health plan options are available to eligible beneficiaries. Availability for each depends on the sponsor’s military status and residence. The three primary health care options offered to eligible beneficiaries are TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Standard, and TRICARE Extra.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.36.1. <b class="calibre1">TRICARE Prime.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">TRICARE Prime is the managed care option and offers the most affordable and comprehensive health coverage to beneficiaries. Active duty members and their families do not pay enrollment fees, annual deductibles, or copays for care, unless they seek care in the network without a primary care manager referral. Each Prime enrollee is assigned a primary care manager who is responsible for providing routine, non-emergency, and urgent health care. The primary care manager is responsible for submitting referrals for specialty care and establishing medical necessity when needed. The primary care manager also coordinates with the regional TRICARE contractor, when necessary, to find specialists in the network. TRICARE Prime also has time and distance standards for urgent, routine, and specialty care to ensure beneficiaries can conveniently access care when the care is needed. Other Prime benefits include travel reimbursement for some specialty care, and a point-of-service option that permits enrollees to seek care from any provider without a referral; however, the point-of-service option carries significantly higher deductibles and cost shares then those under TRICARE Standard. TRICARE Prime is the only health plan option available to active duty service members.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.36.1.1. <b class="calibre1">TRICARE Prime Remote. </b>TRICARE Prime Remote is a stateside health plan option for active duty service members and active duty family members who live and work 50 miles or one-hour drive time from a medical treatment facility in a TRICARE Prime Remote designated zip code.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.36.1.1.1. <b class="calibre1">Active Duty Service Members.</b> Uniformed service members on extended active duty orders who meet TRICARE Prime Remote qualifications are required to enroll in TRICARE Prime Remote. In some cases where geographic boundaries create undue hardship for travel, active duty service members living closer than 50 miles may be eligible for TRICARE Prime Remote.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.36.1.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Active Duty Family Members.</b> Active duty family members residing with their TRICARE Prime Remote-enrolled sponsors are eligible for TRICARE Prime Remote for active duty family members and must enroll to enjoy the benefit. Family members enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote for active duty family members may remain enrolled even if the sponsor receives unaccompanied permanent change of station orders as long as they continue to reside in the same TRICARE Prime Remote location.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.36.1.2. <b class="calibre1">TRICARE Overseas Program Prime Remote. </b>TRICARE overseas program offers Prime coverage to active duty service members permanently assigned to designated remote locations and their eligible command-sponsored family members. Only active duty family members who meet the Joint Travel Regulation definition of command sponsored are eligible for TRICARE overseas program Prime Remote enrollment.</p>
	<p class="block_34">18.36.2. <b class="calibre1">TRICARE Standard and Extra and TRICARE Overseas Program Standard.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">TRICARE Standard and Extra are fee-for-service plans available to eligible non-active duty beneficiaries throughout the United States. TRICARE Standard is the stateside program and TRICARE Overseas Program Standard is the overseas program. Enrollment is not required and coverage is automatic as long as the beneficiary is eligible and registered in the Defense Eligibility and Enrollment System. When using TRICARE Standard and Extra, the beneficiary may visit any TRICARE-authorized provider within the network or outside the network. Care within military medical treatment facilities is on a space-available basis only. Referrals for health care are not needed under these two health plans, but some services may require prior authorization. The network status of the provider being seen determines whether the beneficiary will be charged copays under TRICARE Standard or TRICARE Extra. When visiting a non-network provider, the Standard option is being used and Standard copays apply. When visiting a network provider, the Extra option is being used and the beneficiary will pay less out of pocket as compared to non-network providers. Additionally, when using network providers, the provider will file all medical claims on behalf of the beneficiary and the beneficiary will not be liable for any charges outside of the TRICARE copay and deductible.</p>
	<p class="block_27">18.36.3. <b class="calibre1">TRICARE Reserve Select.</b></p>
	<p class="block_35">TRICARE Reserve Select plan is a premium-based health plan available for purchase worldwide and offers a TRICARE Standard-like benefit. TRICARE Reserve Select is available for purchase by qualified members of the selected Reserve for themselves and their eligible family members. Members must not be enrolled or eligible to enroll in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program.</p>
	<p class="block_27">18.36.4. <b class="calibre1">TRICARE Young Adult.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The TRICARE Young Adult program is a premium-based health care plan available for purchase by qualified dependents when dependents “age out” of TRICARE eligibility. TRICARE Young Adult offers TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Standard coverage worldwide. TRICARE Young Adult includes medical and pharmacy benefits, but excludes dental coverage.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.36.4.1. Young adult dependents may generally purchase TRICARE young adult coverage when the following criteria are met:</p>
	<p class="block_36">18.36.4.1.1. The young adult is a dependent of a TRICARE-eligible uniformed service sponsor.</p>
	<p class="block_36">18.36.4.1.2. Unmarried.</p>
	<p class="block_36">18.36.4.1.3. At least 21 (or age 23 if previously enrolled in a full-time course of study at an approved institution of higher learning and if the sponsor provides at least 50 percent of the financial support), or has not yet reached age 26.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.36.4.2. Young adult dependents may not purchase TRICARE young adult coverage when they are:</p>
	<p class="block_36">18.36.4.2.1. Eligible to enroll in an employer-sponsored health plan as defined in TRICARE Young Adult regulations.</p>
	<p class="block_36">18.36.4.2.2. Eligible for a different TRICARE program.</p>
	<p class="block_36">18.36.3.2.3. Married.</p>
	<p class="block_9">18.37. TRICARE Dental Program.</p>
	<p class="block_37">The TRICARE Dental Program is a voluntary, premium-based dental insurance plan and offers dental coverage for a wide range of services to active duty family members, Guard/Reserve members, and their eligible family members. Active duty service members (and Reservists called to active duty for more than 30 days) are not eligible for TRICARE Dental Program. Beneficiaries will pay monthly premiums and cost-shares. Monthly premiums vary based on sponsor and member status. All dental care is provided by civilian dentists, and either the dentist or the patient is required to file claims for reimbursement.</p>
	<p class="block_2" lang="fr">Section 18G—Suicide Prevention</p>
	<p class="block_3" lang="fr">18.38. Suicide Defined.</p>
	<p class="block_5">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines suicide as death caused by self-directed injurious behavior with an intent to die as a result of the behavior.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.39. Suicide Demographics.</p>
	<p class="block_5">In any given year, roughly 40,000 Americans die by suicide, almost twice as many as are killed by homicide. The military is not exempt from the problem of suicide. Suicide remains a leading cause of concern and preventable form of death among Air Force personnel. During the last five years (2011 - 2015) the Air Force lost between 43- 63 Airmen per year to death by suicide. This equates to 12.9 to 20.3 suicides for every 100,000 Airmen. The Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve components have lost an average of 25 Airmen per year. Additionally, the Air Force has lost an average of 18 civilian employees to death by suicide over the last five years. Within the Air Force, the most common stressors experienced by those who die by suicide are relationship problems, legal problems, mental health problems, financial hardship and work problems. Air Force data shows that while all age, rank, gender and ethnic groups are represented suicide is most common amongst young, junior enlisted Caucasian males.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.40. Effect on the Military.</p>
	<p class="block_5">When suicides occur in the Air Force, they may result in a number of serious consequences, which include:</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.40.1. First and foremost, a preventable loss of human life.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.40.2. Second, the grief and loss to the deceased’s family, friends, co-workers, and military community.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.40.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Third, a direct impact on mission capability through loss of the deceased’s skills, experience, and productivity.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.41. Dynamics of Suicide.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.41.1. The reasons for considering suicide will vary from person to person. All people experience stressors (i.e., challenges or problems) and distress (i.e., the negative feelings associated with stressors). Research tends to identify that risk for suicide is associated with feeling isolated/not belonging, the belief that the individual is or will become a burden and an acquired capability both in access to a means to die and overcoming the fear of dying. Other factors associated with suicide are new or worsening stressors/distress combined with an inability to problem solve/cope. The Air Force promotes and supports Airmen who resolve their problems and challenges in healthy, safe, and constructive ways. To that end, the Air Force has developed many resources to help Airmen and their families resolve these problems.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.48.2. Airmen must know the importance of recognizing that anyone can become suicidal, regardless of how well they have managed military or personal stress previously. If an Airman experiences stressors or problems that overwhelm their ability to cope, it may result in feeling distressed, alone, and a burden to others. This may increase vulnerability and susceptibility to suicide.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.42. Protective Factors.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.42.1. Protective factors are strengths or resources which the individual possesses or practices which enhance resilience and reduce distress. Common protective factors include:</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.42.1.1. Sense of belonging.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.42.1.2. Good, healthy support from family, friends, and fellow Airmen.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.42.1.3. Effective problem solving skills and coping strategies.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.42.1.4. Individual’s belief that he/she has control over his/her own life and actions.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.42.1.5. Willingness to seek help early.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.42.1.6. Focus on the future.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.42.1.7. Believe things will get better.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.42.1.8. Lack of access to means to hurt yourself.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.42.1.9. Cultural/religious/spiritual beliefs that discourage suicide and support self-preservation.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.42.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Demographic factors are personal and unchangeable by the individual. They include aspects such as gender or age. Common stressors are experiences which may increase risk. They include experiences such as problems in a relationship or legal problems. Risk factors are personal characteristics which reduce resilience or increase susceptibility to illness and suicide. Risk factors include a history of mental illness or use of substances. Warning signs are sudden and signify a person is in distress and requires support. Warning signs include sudden changes such as sleep difficulties or sudden discipline problems (See Figure 18.5.).</p>

	<p class="block_9">18.43. Common Problems.</p>
	<p class="block_27">18.43.1. <b class="calibre1">Legal Problems.</b> Being under investigation for a suspected criminal offense is extremely stressful. Legal problems almost always entail some type of career impact and can be cause for administrative action by the Air Force. Military members who face serious legal problems often worry about public disgrace, a very real threat to their careers, their freedom, or their ability to find work if separated from the Air Force. While criminal charges carry realistic consequences, some individuals may begin thinking of the worst possible outcome whether realistic or not. This increased stress (real or perceived) is why they need more support from their command, unit, and Air Force community regardless of the crime for which they have been investigated/charged/convicted.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.43.2. <b class="calibre1">Financial Problems. </b>Financial problems can be a stressor and a cause of distress. Alert commanders often recognize this as symptomatic of a possible broader pattern of problems or poor decision-making. Financial problems can also be a symptom of other problems such as gambling or substance misuse/addiction.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.43.3.<b class="calibre1"> Relationship Problems. </b>Relationship problems are the most common stressor type among Air Force members who have died by suicide. An abrupt loss, like a break up in a romantic relationship is a frequently seen stressor. A healthy, happy and supportive relationship can be an important protective factor against many other kinds of stress. When relationships are troubled they may add to personal stress/distress and/or make other stressors more challenging to manage.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.43.4.<b class="calibre1"> Work and Administrative Problems. </b>Work and administrative problems (e.g., failure to complete tasks, poor performance or showing up to work late) have been noted in many Air Force suicides. These work related stressors may be a sign of other problems (e.g., alcohol or relationship problems) and/or they may influence or increase feelings of hopelessness and isolation. Feelings of hopelessness and isolation increase vulnerability and susceptibility to suicide. An Airman facing administrative problems like fitness testing failures may feel his career and future are at risk. Airmen must be able to identify and understand the seriousness of workplace or administrative problems. Front line leaders and fellow Airmen should understand the challenges that an Airman may be experiencing and act to provide support.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.43.5.<b class="calibre1"> Mental Health Problems. </b>Studies in non-military populations have tended to show that up to 90% of individuals dying from suicide have evidence of past mental health problems. This has led to the assumption that mental health problems lead to suicide. While many individuals who die by suicide have a mental health history the majority of individuals with a mental health history will not attempt or die by suicide. Mental health problems are common among Airmen who die by suicide. Despite the difficulty to fully quantify mental health problems among Airmen who die by suicide, since Airmen may avoid seeking mental health care and/or may under-report their symptoms. Most mental health problems treated in the Air Force are not severe and many mental health visits are related to difficulties with life stresses rather than a serious mental illness. However, individuals with significant mental illness are at increased risk of suicide. Therefore, Airmen with symptoms of a mental illness must understand the importance of seeking help early and complying with their treatment plans. <span class="calibre6">Effective treatments for mental illness are available and can reduce risk of suicide.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_3">18.44. Facts about Air Force Suicides.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.44.1.<b class="calibre1"> Planned versus Unplanned. </b>Suicides may be unplanned (impulsive) or planned. In unplanned suicides, there may be little or no warning. These may be very difficult to predict or prevent and can be associated with excessive use of alcohol or other substances. In planned suicides, an individual may take the time to plan out the aspects of their death, like updating a will or checking on life insurance. While these are normal activities for most adults to undertake, a pattern of behavior in an Airman that indicates he is “putting his affairs in order” may indicate consideration of suicide. There are often some indicators in either planned or unplanned suicides that can be detected. See the list of risk factors to identify potential changes.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.44.2. <b class="calibre1">Communication of Intent. </b>Not every Airman who dies by suicide will communicate their intention to end their life. Some may make suicidal statements (e.g., stating that others would be better off without them), or send texts, use voicemails, social media posts or leave a note. Sometimes suicidal individuals talk about themes of death and suicide, without referring to themselves. In other cases, the deceased may not communicate their intent at all. The increase in the use of electronic communications presents another medium for people to communicate suicidal thoughts or intentions as well as new opportunities for alert Airmen to intervene. Any suicidal remark should be taken very seriously and followed up on. Some people are reluctant to ask a person whether they are having thoughts of suicide because of the fear that they will give someone the idea. Substantial research indicates that this is not the case. The opposite is true: asking a person if they are having thoughts of suicide may prevent a suicide by getting the person the care they need.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.44.3.<b class="calibre1"> Time of Year versus Unpredictable Variability.</b> Statistically, suicide is a rare occurrence. Because of the infrequent, suicide rates in small populations (e.g. a major command) vary quite randomly. This often leads people to try to find factors like time of year to explain rises and dips in rate. One such myth is that suicide is more common during the holidays when people may feel more alone and isolated. This is not true. Personal factors like the ones described above are much more important. Vigilance must be maintained year round.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.44.4.<b class="calibre1"> Changes in Behavior versus no Change in Behavior. </b>A common myth is that once an Airman has made the decision to die by suicide, they may appear calm, as if all their problems have been resolved. This may be true for some, but not all. Airmen need to be observant for any sudden changes in behavior or attitude in their fellow Airman. These changes should be attended to in a supportive manner to ensure the individual is not considering suicide.</p>
	<p class="block_40">18.45. Self-injurious Behavior and Suicide Attempts.</p>
	<p class="block_5">Self-injurious behavior (i.e., cutting, burning) is any behavior that intentionally causes harm to the individual regardless of the severity of the injury. A suicide attempt is any behavior whose intent is to end the individual’s life, regardless of the outcome. Any self-injury or suicide attempt should be treated as serious as the severity of injury is not an accurate indicator of the person’s potential risk or intent. These injuries warrant immediate medical and command attention and should be addressed and reported without delay.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.46. Every Airman’s Responsibilities.</p>
	<p class="block_5">In the Air Force, each Airman has the responsibility to identify and support other Airmen (Regular Air Force, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, Civilians and Family Members) in times of need. Each Airman must be aware of the following: (1) Command is available and trained to provide support to Airmen in need, or those attempting to support their Airmen; (2) The Air Force established numerous resources aimed at resolving problems and stressors. Airmen can access these resources through chaplains, medical services or command leadership; (3) Airman can access counseling through Military One Source (1-800-342-9647) as well as Military Family Life Counselors; and (4) National resources like the Military Crisis line (1-800-273-8233, Press 1). Early identification combined with proactive problem solving enhances careers. Early intervention increases the probability of success, and is most likely to save a life; similarly, this helps maintain the balance promoted through the four domains of Comprehensive Airmen Fitness (Social, Mental, Physical and Spiritual). There are a number of identifiable risk factors and warning signs. These may include: (1) multiple stressors or an intense stressor, sudden mood or behavior changes; (2) giving away personal effects; and (3) making statements about suicide/suggesting it would be better if the individual were not alive. Safety is increased when an at-risk Airman has limited access to means of self-harm (e.g., firearms or potentially dangerous medications). Command and Legal should be part of this process. Any sudden purchase of lethal means can be a very significant warning sign that should be questioned and reported.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.46.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>The people most likely to spot a person at risk for suicide are the ones who interact with that person on a daily basis (e.g., friends, coworkers or immediate supervisors). These individuals are best positioned to notice changes in an at-risk Airman’s behavior, mood, and performance. Engage with that person, find out what caused the observed changes, assist in choosing resources to resolve stressors, and communicate concerns with the chain of command as appropriate.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.46.2. Know your resources and encourage appropriate help-seeking from installation and other support agencies to resolve the challenges. Challenges and stressors are a normal part of each person’s life. You are encouraged to engage with fellow Airman and know how they generally look and behave. When you notice there is a problem, assist your fellow Airman in finding help to resolve the challenge early.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.47. Military Leadership Role in Preventing Suicide:</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.47.1. While suicide prevention is the ultimate responsibility of every Airman, the Air Force has identified that leadership support and action across the levels of command are critical to the goal of reducing suicide in the Air Force.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.47.2. The Air Force Suicide Prevention program is based on leadership action. Leaders at all levels are responsible for implementing this program. Successful risk identification rests with the Airman’s most immediate associates and his or her first-line supervisors who see and interact with them on a daily basis and are in a position to see any changes in behavior or performance that may signal a problem. Open communication between Airmen and their supervisors, especially in an environment where there is genuine concern for everyone’s well-being, is vitally important.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.47.3. Frontline supervisors have tremendous and complex responsibilities in our high ops tempo Air Force, executing the mission and taking care of their subordinates. Effective training and strong leadership can enhance the support that an Airman will receive. Some factors that can challenge effective supervision are: (1) tunnel vision on the mission to the exclusion of subordinate needs; (2) not being engaged with their Airmen; (3) difficulty recognizing risk factors and warning signs; (4) lack of knowledge of Air Force supported resources and the true impact of seeking help on an Air Force career; and (5) inappropriately “protecting” the Airman from the consequences of their actions or failing to take proper action. Some examples of inappropriate supervisor actions are supervisors telling subordinates to avoid seeking mental health assistance as this will hurt their career, helping subordinates hide alcohol and drug misuse problems, promoting the avoidance of installation helping services and possible safe and constructive resolution of problems. The majority of the time, seeking help appropriately does not have long-term negative career impact. In fact, seeking help can improve performance and enable people to better solve problems. Supervisors should engage in problems early to ensure subordinates get the help they need to maintain peak performance.</p>
	<p class="block_4"><span class="text_4">18.47.4. When risk is identified, appropriate professional resources can be obtained and applied to the problem. The Air Force has invested in the development of outstanding helping resources whose purpose is to support individuals in distress, leaders in enhancing safety, promoting balance in the four domains of Comprehensive Airmen Fitness and preventing suicide. Appropriate intervention will vary depending on the nature of the problem and degree of risk. Sometimes situations require services from multiple support agencies (e.g., Mental Health, Airman &amp; Family Readiness and Chaplains, etc.). The Airman’s Guide for Assisting Personnel in Distress provides resources to help supervisors and Airmen guide personnel to appropriate helping agencies and is available at: </span><a href="http://www.airforcemedicine.af.mil/airmansguide/index.asp" class="text_5">airforcemedicine.af.mil/airmansguide</a><span class="text_4">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_3">18.48. Actions to Mitigate Suicide Risk.</p>
	<p class="block_5">While not every suicide can be prevented, definite steps can be taken by Air Force personnel to reduce risk in Air Force populations. The following actions can be taken to support Airmen in resolving life’s challenges and reducing the number of suicides: (1) Knowing your co-workers; their usual mood and behaviors, and how they are functioning; (2) Being able to recognize early signs of risk, stress and distress; (3) Engaging with Airmen to determine what may be stressful or problematic; (4) Assisting Airmen with choosing the most appropriate resource to help resolve the problem; and (5) Following up with Airmen to ensure the stressors are resolving and new ones are not taking their place.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.49. Psychological Services.</p>
	<p class="block_5">Mental Health Services are designed to be a force multiplier in the Air Force. Seeking care for a mental health problem is a sign of strength and increases the likelihood of recovery while reducing risk for suicide. More than 12% of Air Force personnel voluntarily seek mental health services each year.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.49.1. At the installation level, mental health clinic staff members typically perform a risk assessment on all individuals who come in for services as well as screen for suicide at follow up appointments. The services and treatment provided at mental health clinics play an important role in suicide prevention, but the healthcare system does not own the problem and can only act if aware of the problem. This means individuals at risk must either seek help themselves or be brought into the healthcare system by others. Suicide prevention is the responsibility of the entire Air Force community.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.49.2. A common fear is that seeking care at the mental health clinic will have negative impact on the person’s career. A 2006 study (Rowan, A.B. &amp; Campise R. L., 2006) reviewing more than 1,000 self-referred mental health cases found that in 89 percent of cases there was no contact at all between the mental health clinic and the patient’s unit. In 97% of cases there was no negative impact on career. Confidentiality is governed by AFI 44-172 <i class="calibre2">Mental Health.</i></p>

	<p class="block_5">The Air Force Suicide Prevention Program is an evidence based approach which requires that all personnel take an active role in reducing suicide.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.50.1.<b class="calibre1"> Suicide Prevention Program’s History.</b> In May 1996, General Thomas S. Moorman, Air Force Vice- Commander, commissioned an integrated product team composed of all functional areas of the Air Force. He requested General Charles H. Roadman (Air Force Surgeon General) chair the 75-member committee and develop suicide prevention strategies. The suicide prevention integrated product team quickly realized suicide was not a medical problem, but instead was a community problem. To establish an effective program, they designed a line program owned by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force with the Air Force Surgeon General as the office of primary responsibility. The program was founded upon the concept that decreasing suicides required a community/Public Health approach in which prevention and assistance were offered long before someone became suicidal. </p>
	<p class="block_5">18.50.2. <b class="calibre1">Air Force Suicide Prevention Summit</b>. In 2015, in response to a concern about rising suicide rates, the Air Force convened a Suicide Prevention Summit, bringing together subject matter experts from DoD, the Military Services, federal agencies including the National Institute for Mental Health and Centers for Disease Control and academic researchers and theorists, to address the issue of suicide in the Air Force and move the program forward. Based on the recommendations of the Summit, six interconnected Suicide Prevention Lines of Effort were identified and six corresponding working groups were formed under oversight of the Air Force Integrated Delivery System and Community Action information Board. These Lines of Effort’s included: (1) Integrate Prevention; (2) Strengthen Airman Culture; (3) Leverage Strength-Based Communication; (4) Enhance Civilian Support Services; (5) Targeted Resilience Outreach; and (6) Improve Medical Care of At-risk Airmen. The 11 elements were retained as the core of the program while a wide range of initiatives were established and executed under the Lines of Effort framework to enhance the effectiveness of suicide prevention. </p>

	<p class="block_3">18.51. Intervention Model.</p>
	<p class="block_5">Suicide prevention is everyone’s responsibility. For effective suicide prevention, we need to create a culture that encourages early help-seeking behavior and develop a community that provides assistance long before someone becomes suicidal. The model listed below was developed to assist Airmen in intervening when an Airman is experiencing stress, distress and challenges.</p>
	<p class="block_11"> </p>
	<p class="block_11"> </p>
	<p class="block_5">18.51.1. <b class="calibre1">The Ask, Care, and Escort (ACE) Model.</b></p>
	<p class="block_41">To facilitate personal engagement in suicide prevention, the Air Force has developed the acronym, ACE, to help people remember the key steps.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.51.1.1. <b class="calibre1">Ask. </b>When you see or hear any of the warning signs discussed in this section, or are aware of risk factors in someone’s life, ask questions to learn more about the person’s problems or concerns. If you have any concerns about someone’s safety, calmly but directly ask the question, “Are you thinking of killing/hurting yourself?” Asking about suicide gives people permission to talk about a subject that may otherwise be difficult to bring up and lets the Airman know you are ready to discuss what they are experiencing. Do not promise to keep thoughts of suicide a secret. Airmen need to remember the importance of sharing these concerns with command and professionals who can help the person.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.51.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Care. S</b>howing care and concern for those at risk is important. Simply taking the time to ask about problems, and asking specifically about suicide shows caring and concern. If someone acknowledges thoughts of suicide, listen to them and allow them to share what is troubling them. Avoid making judgmental statements, such as “you wouldn’t do something so stupid” or immediately trying to solve their problem or talk them out of suicide. If they have shared thoughts of suicide with you, accept that they are in distress, listen to their concerns, and begin the process of getting them help. You should also identify if they have a plan for suicide, what the plan is, and attempt to remove anything that might be used for self-harm, such as weapons or medications. First, understand there are many potential means for self-harm and recommend you take reasonable steps to secure the potential means of suicide while not putting yourself in harm’s way. If you are not able to secure the potential means of self-harm, or you have significant concern about the individual’s safety, then command and emergency services need to be contacted.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.51.1.3. <b class="calibre1">Escort. </b>After asking about suicide and showing concern, the final step is to escort the person to command, or a professional support agency that can provide appropriate assistance. Do not leave him or her alone, or send the person alone to a chaplain or mental health clinic as he or she may change his or her mind on the way. At most bases, chaplains and mental health professionals are on call through the command post, and evaluations can be conducted in local emergency rooms if on-base services are not accessible. If an Airman reveals that he or she is thinking about suicide, this is a life or death emergency and command must be contacted. If a distressed Airman will not agree to go with you, you should contact your chain of command or emergency services for help to ensure the person’s safety.</p>
	<p class="block_42">18.51.2. Understanding the appropriate steps to suicide risk prevention and the available Air Force approved resources can aid in saving the career and life of a fellow Airman. Engage the Airman to understand the problem. Utilize leadership to support safety and good decision-making. In non-crisis situations utilize resources such as chaplain services, Military Family Life Counselors or Military One Source. If an Airman is in crisis utilize emergency services including Air Force, local civilian or national resources, 911, emergency room, mental health clinic or Military Crisis Line (1-800-273-8255) to provide professional support to an Airman in distress.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 18H—Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.52. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Components.</p>
	<p class="block_5">Understanding the difference between operational stress and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is important. Most individuals who experience a traumatic event in an operational environment will have some reaction and some signs of “stress” like problems with sleep or troublesome memories; however, the majority of individuals exposed to a traumatic event will not develop PTSD. PTSD is a complex mental health diagnosis made by trained professionals for individuals meeting specific diagnostic criteria. Prolonged or repeated exposures to stressful or traumatic events increase the chance of stress reactions, and if over looked or untreated can lead to mental health symptoms to include recurrent and unwanted thoughts, images and dreams, exaggerated startle response, and avoidance of situations or activities that remind the individual of aspects of the traumatic event. PTSD also causes persistent mood symptoms, including feelings of depression, foreshortened sense of the future, and an inability to express the full range of emotions. This latter symptom is often noticed by friends and family members who are more likely to notice a mood or behavioral change in the individual with PTSD. Since the dawn of time, people have experienced traumatic events and many have the skills and resources to deal with them. For this reason most stress reactions resolve on their own or with minimal assistance, especially when identified early. Therefore, the benefit to the individual, unit and mission is to recognize and respond to stressors and stress-related symptoms proactively when they are present in the unit or individual. However, do not assume that simply because someone has been exposed to trauma, they will inevitably develop PTSD. If symptoms from a traumatic event emerge, they usually emerge within the first 30 days of the trauma and for someone to develop delayed onset PTSD in the absence of any initial symptoms is unusual. Some of the symptoms of PTSD you might notice in yourself or your wingmen are listed below. Depending on many factors, like the severity and number of exposures, for a small subset of individuals, stress reactions do not resolve on their own, and symptoms of PTSD may develop. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 defines PTSD by eight criteria: (1) stressor (there must be a traumatic incident the person was exposed to); (2) intrusive symptoms (the person persistently re-experiences the event); (3) avoidance (the person attempts to avoid reminders of the event); (4) negative alterations in cognitions (thoughts) and mood; (5) alterations in arousal and reactivity (like irritability, easy startle and sleep difficulties); (6) duration (persistence of symptoms greater than one month); (7) functional significance (impact to functional areas (e.g., social, occupational)); and (8) exclusion (disturbance not due to medication, substance use or other illness). As with most mental health diagnoses, other conditions must first be ruled-out before a diagnosis of PTSD can be made. This includes the effects of medication, alcohol or a co-existing medical condition that shares some of the symptoms of PTSD. </p>
	<p class="block_3">18.53. PTSD Incidence.</p>
	<p class="block_5">New rates of diagnosed PTSD continue to remain relatively low (under 1%) among total force Airmen, but differ by gender and career group. Women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with PTSD as men, and specific career fields show elevated rates of PTSD, including special investigators, medical, and support personnel. Deployment is a risk factor for PTSD because deployment increases the likelihood of exposure to trauma. However, an important note is that most people who develop PTSD experience a non-combat trauma such as interpersonal violence which can occur in a number of different environments.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.54. Prevention.</p>
	<p class="block_5">The prevention of PTSD occurs by fostering resilient coping responses to stress. The more psychologically capable the individual is to withstand a stressful situation, the less likely that individual is to develop PTSD. An internal locus of control, the belief that and commitment to life values, and a supportive peer network are all factors that bolster the stress response and enable Airmen to go through trauma without negative consequences. Further, the ability to recognize stress reactions and intervene when they are present is important in the prevention of PTSD and other mental health issues. This is based on the theory that preparation for trauma helps to “insulate” the individual and gain a sense of control or mastery over the environment. Deploying Airman receive just in time training on stress reactions, psychological first aid, and referral resources through online Pre-Deployment mental health training (in Advanced Distributed Learning Service). Additionally, post deployment training (currently provided by installation mental health staff) focuses on the reintegration back into home life and work after a deployment and how to recognize stress reactions and symptoms that can remain or emerge following a deployment where there have been potentially traumatic experiences. Critical to the prevention of PTSD is for leaders to clearly communicate mission details and expectations to the extent possible so that deploying Airmen can anticipate their deployment experiences and practice adaptive coping responses prior to exposure to trauma. Preparation also helps Airman evaluate the possible difficulties they may experience during deployment and develop a plan for managing those difficulties before they occur. </p>
	<p class="block_5">18.54.1.<b class="calibre1"> Risk and Protective Factors.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">18.54.1.1. There are many factors that can make an individual more vulnerable to negative effects of traumatic experiences and to eventually develop PTSD. Some of these include ongoing life stresses, lack of social support, history of a psychiatric disorder/or family history of one, and past stresses like prior combat exposure, and even childhood history of abuse. Each individual has different personal strengths and resilience skills that help him or her deal with traumatic experiences. Therefore, each unit is a sum of these strengths and each deployed unit should capitalize on these strengths. Understanding your personal strengths and vulnerabilities and those of the others in your unit allows you to intervene early after a traumatic event and seek out the support needed for resolving stress reactions. Remember, risk factors or even exposure to horrific events do not equal a diagnosis of PTSD.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.54.1.2. Effective unit leadership is a critical factor in preventing PTSD. A cohesive unit with solid leadership, clear operational goals, and frequent communication can reduce risk. Leadership which stresses and Airmen who practice good self-care (getting regular and adequate sleep, eating a balanced diet, and having adequate time for rest and relaxation) along with the use of positive stress management skills can help reduce operational stress and decrease the risk of PTSD. Informed leaders can actively impact their units to reduce the risk of PTSD and other related problems to their Airmen by ensuring they are engaged and working as a team.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.54.2. <b class="calibre1">Operational Stress Reactions.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Operational stress reactions can be experienced by both individuals exposed to a traumatic event or those individuals/units with a high operational tempo where the requirements of battle have kept them from having adequate downtime. Stress reactions may be evident in different forms and may range from mild to severe. Below are some of the reactions to be aware of to ensure early intervention.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.54.2.1. Physical signs like rapid breathing or shortness of breath, feeling dizzy, headaches, feeling nauseated, profuse sweating or sweaty palms, and rapid heart rate.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.54.2.2. Mental signs like sleep disturbance, poor attention and concentration, poor problem solving, confusion, hyper-vigilance, and nightmares.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.54.2.3. Emotional signs like irritability and blaming others, fear or anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, feeling guilt, denial, agitation, and feelings of sadness (depressed mood).</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.54.2.4. Behavioral signs like withdrawal, change in communication, increased alcohol consumption, change in appetite, emotional outbursts, jumpiness or being easily startled, and suspiciousness.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.54.3. <b class="calibre1">Psychological First Aid.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Psychological first aid is designed to reduce the initial distress caused by a traumatic event and can be used for ongoing operational stress where individuals may exhibit stress reactions. Psychological first aid supports individuals with stress reactions by teaching adaptive coping and recovery skills that can easily be implemented. For individuals whose stress reactions aren’t resolving in a short period of time, additional support from Mental Health or the Combat &amp; Operational Stress Control unit should be encouraged. Tenets of psychological first aid include the following:</p>
	<p class="block_25">18.54.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Safety.</b> Provide a physically and emotionally safe place (as the operational environment allows) for individuals to recuperate emotionally following a traumatic event. This may be as simple as designating a tent/shelter away from the incident with food, water and a place to relax.</p>
	<p class="block_25">18.54.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Needs.</b> Learn what the Airmen’s needs and concerns are by listening to them with compassion and responding with a calm voice. Are they worried about someone? Do they want to make a phone call?</p>
	<p class="block_25">18.54.3.3. <b class="calibre1">Availability.</b> Make yourself available. For example, offer to go to the gym, dining facility, play games, morale tent, or just be there to talk/listen.</p>
	<p class="block_25">18.54.3.4. <b class="calibre1">Support.</b> Encourage Airmen to stay connected with peers and social support, this maybe in the deployed setting or at home.</p>
	<p class="block_25">18.54.3.5. <b class="calibre1">Coping.</b> Provide basic coping skills that empower others to make decisions for one’s self and restoration back to ‘normal’ state. Lead by example using self-care mentioned earlier.</p>
	<p class="block_25">18.54.3.6. <b class="calibre1">Services.</b> Finally, link individual with supportive services, if needed. These include Chaplains, first sergeants, or Mental Health.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.54.4. <b class="calibre1">Pre-Exposure Preparation.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">18.54.4.1. The goal of Pre-Exposure preparation is to enhance resilience through anticipating and understanding normal responses to unusual stressors which might include exposure to battle or a mass accident scene with human casualties. Individuals are better prepared, are calmer and feel more in control when they have some advance knowledge of what to expect on scene and what stress reactions are normal and to be expected. Pre-Exposure preparation focuses on preparing Airmen for a particular mission or incident by providing relevant (and sometimes graphic) details applicable to the probable upcoming mission or situation. In preparing Airmen for a mission, Pre-Exposure preparation training will educate the Airman on three key steps to support successful performance under stress by: (1) Being aware of the individual’s functioning and changes in functioning (such as changes in their behavior, sleep, or mood); (2) Identifying and practicing positive stress management behaviors (such as getting proper sleep, nutrition, and exercise); and (3) Avoiding unhelpful coping behaviors (such as excessive alcohol usage, poor sleep or eating practices, etc). Pre-Exposure preparation should be tailored to the unit and specific mission in order to be relevant and effective.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.54.4.2. Units that have a moderate or higher chance of exposure to traumatic events as part of their duties can enhance their psychological resilience and risk of operational stress with the following preparation principles:<span class="tab">      </span></p>
	<p class="block_6">18.54.4.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Engage in Realistic Training. </b>Get Airmen ready for the tasks they will perform in the operational environment.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Train using simulated or actual exposure to realistic events, such as body handling, survival training, and mock captivity training, as appropriate for the unit’s mission.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.54.4.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> Strengthen Perceived Ability to Cope. </b>Feeling competent to do one’s job in an operational environment is critical.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Discuss reasons for realistic training. Enhance the individual’s sense of competency by training to the point until the Airmen feels competent and has gained a sense of mastery. If possible, include the teaching of coping skills during operational training in order to increase the likelihood that the Airmen will use those skills when needed.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.55. Treatment.</p>
	<p class="block_42">Today, there are treatments available for PTSD that have been demonstrated through rigorous scientific research to be high effective. These are referred to as Evidence-Based Treatments. The Air Force has supported training in two Evidence-Based Treatments by requiring training in one or more Evidence-Based Treatments during mental health residency programs in psychiatry, psychology, and social work. Direct accession providers receive training in Evidence-Based Treatments during their first assignment through a collaborative arrangement with the Center for Deployment Psychology. The two Evidence-Based Treatments that are taught to all mental health providers in the United States Air Force are: (a) Cognitive Processing Therapy; and (b) Prolonged Exposure. These are among the Evidence-Based Treatments that have been recommended as first-line treatment of PTSD by the Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense Clinical Practice Guidelines based on a detailed review of the scientific literature. Typical treatment protocols include 10-12, weekly sessions with a trained provider in a supportive, therapeutic environment. Most research indicates that Evidence-Based Treatments reduces PTSD symptoms by approximately 50% and that this improvement is sustained over several months to years. In many cases, Airmen diagnosed with PTSD and treated with Evidence-Based Treatments will “lose” the PTSD diagnosis and will notice that symptoms either disappear entirely, or are sub-threshold and do not interfere with quality of life. If properly treated, the majority of Airmen diagnosed with PTSD never require a medical board.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 18I—Stress Management</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.56. Stress Defined.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.56.1. At some point in your life, you have probably experienced stress. Long work days, increased deployments, and financial issues are just a few of the things that can make you feel stressed. The frequency of stress and the significant negative effect stress can have on people and organizations make this a major concern of enlisted leaders at all levels. The importance at the organizational level is because stress can negatively affect performance, organizational effectiveness, and mission accomplishment. On a personal level, experiencing stress over an extended period of time can lead to health problems and affect your overall quality of life. Therefore, the importance is to personally and professionally recognize stress and to learn how to manage stress effectively.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.56.2. Stress is a dynamic concept that dates back to earlier this century. According to Jerrold S. Greenberg in his book <i class="calibre2">Comprehensive Stress Management</i>, the concept of stress is based on the research of two individuals named Walter Cannon and Hans Selye. Cannon, a physiologist at Harvard Medical School, was the first person to describe the body’s reaction to stress. He identified this reaction as a response to a perceived threat that prepared the body for flight or fight. Later research conducted by Selye, an endocrinologist widely regarded as the father of stress research, concluded that the body’s reaction to stress was the same regardless of whether the source was good or bad, positive or negative. He also provided us with a useful definition of stress. According to Selye, stress can be defined as “the nonspecific response of the body to any demand for change.” The demand in Selye’s definition is commonly called a stressor.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.56.3. A stressor can be more accurately defined as any factor (demand) that has the potential to cause stress. This factor can be positive, such as getting promoted, or negative, such as getting fired. The causes of stress is from either positive or negative factors. Selye labeled the stress experienced from positive factors eustress. Eustress results from exhilarating experiences and is the stress of winning and achieving. He labeled the stress experienced from negative factors distress. Distress includes the stress of losing, failing, overworking, and not coping effectively. When you start to feel “stressed out,” distress is usually the type of stress you are feeling.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.56.4. We are in daily contact with many types of stressors. For the most part, we can categorize them into two major areas: organizational stressors and extra-organizational stressors.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.56.4.1. Organizational stressors are the type of factors experienced in the work environment. For Airmen today, that could range from short-notice deployments to hazardous working conditions. Imagine how you would feel if your commander informed you that you would deploy in a week, or how you might feel if your work environment was bombarded with loud noises all day. If these types of situations regularly happen to you and you have not developed effective ways to cope with them, you could experience stress.</p>
	<p class="block_6">18.56.4.2. Extra-organizational stressors are the type of factors experienced outside the work environment. Three major extra-organizational stressors are family, marital, and financial issues. Family and marital issues can run the gamut from minor illness to conflicting roles in the family to a death in the family. Similarly, financial problems can run from the minor to the catastrophic. These types of stressors are important because while they usually occur outside of the duty section, if not properly managed, they can affect performance at work.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.56.5. How do you know if you are stressed? Stress reactions appear in four different categories: cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physical. The key to recognizing stress is to know understand what is normal for you so that you can recognize when something has changed. The combined presence of symptoms determines the degree of the problem. Indicators (Figure 18.6) may be isolated reactions or combinations among the four categories. Finally, the duration, frequency, and intensity of the symptoms could make dealing with stress difficult.</p>
	<p class="block_27">18.56.6. Being able to recognize the symptoms of stress is important, not only for yourself, but for your Airmen, as well. The earlier you identify what stress does to your body and state of mind, the earlier you can employ stress reduction techniques.</p>

	<p class="block_27">18.56.7. Stress management programs and methods vary, but they all tend to have common goals. Individual stress management methods aim at strengthening your ability to manage stressors and the stress response. Organizational stress management methods aim more at altering potential stressors themselves. Because organizational and extra-organizational stressors are interrelated and influence each other, attention to both stress management methods is vitally important.</p>
	<p class="block_19"><b class="calibre1">18.57.</b> <b class="calibre1">Individual Stress Management Methods:</b></p>
	<p class="block_5">18.57.1. <b class="calibre1">Planning.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">You can reduce stress by identifying potential stressors before they cause problems. Once you identify stressors, you can develop strategies to avoid their effects while achieving your goals. For example, if you are stressed by crowds and long lines, don’t plan to visit the commissary on or just after payday. If you get extremely upset when you are recalled in the middle of the night, having the latest recall roster and procedures readily available at all times may help reduce the amount of stress you feel. While planning can’t prevent stress that occurs as an event is happening, planning is extremely valuable in preventing stress before a stressor occurs.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.57.2. <b class="calibre1">Time Management.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Not having enough time to complete a task can be a significant stressor for some people. If time management is an issue for you, you can reduce stress by using effective time management skills and tools, like developing a task list and prioritizing tasks.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.57.3. <b class="calibre1">Overload Avoidance.</b></p>
	<p class="block_25">For most people to eliminate, or at least reduce, the effects of overload-related stressors is relatively simple. For a start, identify and avoid busy work, delegate or empower others when possible, learn to say no, and attempt to negotiate unreasonable deadlines.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.57.4. <b class="calibre1">Relaxation.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Relaxation can help you manage stress and stay alert, energetic, and productive. When you relax, you reduce mind and body tension. By incorporating relaxation skills into your daily routines, you can train your body to respond differently to stress. Relaxation techniques, such as meditation, reading, and listening to music, can improve your heart rate, regulate your blood pressure, and decrease your respiratory rate. If you are experiencing stress in your life, taking the time to relax can reduce the negative effects of stress on your health.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.57.5. <b class="calibre1">Exercise and Good Nutrition.</b></p>
	<p class="block_25">Regular exercise combined with a healthy diet is an effective stress management technique. Exercise can provide an outlet for excess energy and tension caused by stress. Eating nutritious foods ensures your body has the nutrients needed to manage stress, and helps prevent overeating. Exercising and eating a balanced diet help your body become more resistant to the negative results of stress, such as high blood pressure, heart attacks, and frequent illness.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.57.6. <b class="calibre1">Strong Social Support Networks.</b></p>
	<p class="block_25"><span class="calibre6">Having a strong social support network such as family, friends, social clubs, peers etc. can help you manage stress.  Being able to discuss your problems with people who care about you and your wellbeing can help reduce your stress by giving you a more positive outlook, suggest solutions to your problems, or just listen. Just talking about your problems and letting </span>them out can help release any built-up tension and may make you see the situation or problem more clearly. </p>
	<p class="block_19"><b class="calibre1">18.58.</b> <b class="calibre1">Organizational Stress Management Methods.</b></p>
	<p class="block_5">As an Airman or a supervisor, your approach to dealing with stress can help reduce your and your subordinates’ stress levels. You can begin by identifying potential stressors in the work environment and developing strategies to remove or reduce them. Here are a few examples of organizational stress management methods you can use:</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.58.1. <b class="calibre1">Job Design.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">If you identify potential sources of stress associated with tasks, ask yourself if there is a need for each task and if the task is feasible. Eliminate the task if not needed. If the task is feasible, ask yourself how important job design is and prioritize. If your job requires you and/or your subordinates to work long hours, consider using elements of job enrichment, like giving adequate time off or periodic breaks to help reduce potential stress. If within your power restructure the job to better accommodate individual needs and the abilities of your Airmen to help reduce stress and enhance productivity.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.58.2. <b class="calibre1">Improving the Work Environment.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Numerous physical factors within a work environment can be potential stressors. Some of these stressors cannot be eliminated, but you may be able to reduce them. Examine such environmental factors as temperature, noise, light levels, and make necessary improvements.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.58.3.<b class="calibre1"> Improving Organizational Communication.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">A lack of information can be a significant stressor. As a supervisor, you should do your best to keep your subordinates informed about anything that could impact their lives. In addition, you should practice good communication skills, like active listening, being open minded and avoiding prejudging, and humility. These skills not only will help reduce stress, but also promote trust, cooperation, and teamwork within the work center.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.58.4. <b class="calibre1">Personnel Selection and Job Placement.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Having the wrong person in a job position can create a great deal of stress for the individual and others. When possible, you should carefully match individuals to a position they are qualified for based on their skills, level of experience, and rank. In the military, this might not be the easiest thing to do, but you should keep in mind the potential stress-related benefits of having the right person in the right position.</p>
	<p class="block_5">18.58.5. <b class="calibre1">Workplace Conflict.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6"><span class="calibre6">Having conflict with co-workers can cause serious stress within the work center. Look for ways to help resolve any issues you or subordinates may have with others. Sit down and talk with the person with whom you are having conflict with, listen to their point of view and understand what the other person is saying, communicate your point of view in a calm and professional way, and try to come to an agreement or compromise. If the conflict can’t be resolved amongst yourselves you may need to have a mediator to help resolve the issue.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_5">18.58.6. <b class="calibre1">Substance Abuse Programs.</b></p>
	<p class="block_46">Sometimes stress can cause people to resort to excessive amounts of alcohol and/or drugs which can have a dramatically negative effect on mission, morale, and readiness. All supervisors are responsible and accountable for managing substance abusers in accordance with applicable directives and getting them the help they need.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 18J—Redeployment Support Process</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.59. Purpose.</p>
	<p class="block_5">The positive and sustained care, control, and discipline of each Airman is the purpose of the redeployment support process. The goal is to ensure personnel readiness throughout the air and space expeditionary force cycle by providing timely support for our military members and their families. Redeployment support is an ongoing process, not a homecoming event. The intent is to provide continuous, integrated support from the area of responsibility to home station and to assist in the transition from the deployed environment to family life and work site.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.60. Recovery.</p>
	<p class="block_5">After periods of arduous duty and protracted periods of deployment, a lengthy respite from the deployment environment has a beneficial effect on an individual’s psychological and physical status. An immediate recovery period also provides time for the returning Airman to tend to personal needs neglected during lengthy periods away from home. Each major command is responsible for establishing and publishing personnel recovery (leave, passes, attribution, and retention) policies for returning combat forces. See AFI 36-3003, <i class="calibre2">Military Leave Program</i>, for guidance.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.61. Reconstitution.</p>
	<p class="block_5">Although recovery is important to support returning forces as they transition back to their normal environment, they also must be reconstituted for further deployment possibilities, including surge requirements. This process entails planning that will return units back to full combat capability in a short time. While there is no one correct rule set for reconstitution planning, consideration must be given to prioritizing and restoring levels of consumables expended during the crisis, and recovering lost training. Every base/unit must assess their own situation based on such variables as the magnitude, duration, and intensity of a crisis, consumption rates, and the type of deployment location (fixed versus austere base). See AFI 10-401, <i class="calibre2">Air Force Operations Planning and Execution</i>, for further guidance on reconstitution.</p>
	<p class="block_3">18.62. Scope.</p>
	<p class="block_5">The Air Force redeployment support process applies to deployed area of responsibility and home stations. All personnel deployed to an area of responsibility, to continental United States locations in support of contingencies, and to remote assignments are included. Key determinants for participation are lengthy family separation and significant family related stressors prior to reintegration. Community Action Information Board and Integrated Delivery System helping agencies complete specified activities to support redeployed Regular Air Force, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, military and civilian personnel, their family members, and units during the air and space expeditionary force cycle. Readjustment from duty in the area of responsibility requires structured recovery time and activities for members and families prior to leave or temporary duty.</p>

	<p class="block_1">Section 11A—Overview</p>
	<p class="block_2">11.1. Introduction:</p>
	<p class="block_3">11.1.1. The officer and enlisted evaluations, and civilian appraisals deal directly with the Air Force’s most precious resource—people. Supervisors must help their subordinates understand their strengths and weaknesses and how their efforts contribute to the mission. Supervisors must employ the officer and enlisted evaluation systems, and civilian performance program in everyday situations to help develop their subordinates. This chapter addresses the importance of correctly using the officer and enlisted evaluation systems, and civilian performance program, by identifying responsibilities, outlining the performance feedback process, and provides additional information as outlined in governing AFIs 36-2406, <i class="calibre1">Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems</i> and 36-1001, <i class="calibre1">Managing the Civilian Performance Program</i> respectively.</p>
	<p class="block_3">11.1.2. The officer and enlisted evaluation systems, and civilian performance program provides:</p>
	<p class="block_4">11.1.2.1. Meaningful feedback to individuals pertaining to what is expected of them, advice on how well they are meeting expectations, and advice on how to better meet these expectations.</p>
	<p class="block_4">11.1.2.2. A reliable, long-term, cumulative record of performance and potential based on performance.</p>

	<p class="block_9">11.4. General Guidelines:</p>
	<p class="block_10">11.4.1. <b class="calibre2">Access to Evaluations.</b> Evaluations are For Official Use Only and are subject to the Privacy Act. They are exempt from public disclosure under DoD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement (AFSUPDODR 5400-7), DoD Freedom of Information Act Program and AFI 33-332, <i class="calibre1">Privacy Act Program</i>. Only persons within the agency who have a proper need to know may read the evaluations. The office with custodial responsibility is responsible for determining if a person's official duties require access. See Chapter two for access to the Airman Comprehensive Assessment (ACA) Worksheets. </p>
	<p class="block_10">11.4.2. <b class="calibre2">Classified Information and Security Classification.</b> Do not enter classified information in any section of the evaluation; this includes any type of evaluation forms, attachments to evaluations, referral documents, or endorsements to referral documents. If an entry would result in the release of classified information, use the word "Data Masked" in place of that entry. The Personnel Accounting Symbol code alone is unclassified, however this code will only be entered on the ratee. In the Senior Rater Identification block enter five asterisks, (*****). In those cases where the evaluator is with a classified organization or location, enter "Data Masked" for organization nomenclature and nothing more. </p>
	<p class="block_10">11.4.3. <b class="calibre2">Bullet Format.</b> Bullet format is mandatory. Use bullet format as specified in the appropriate table for the evaluation being accomplished. Bullets are limited to a minimum of one line and a maximum two lines per bullet and white space is authorized. Main bullets begin at the left margin and will have one space after the “-“. If unfamiliar with the proper bullet format, refer to “The Bullet Background Paper” in AFH 33-337, <i class="calibre1">The Tongue and Quill. </i>Although the <i class="calibre1">Tongue and Quill </i>allows three lines per bullet, evaluations will not have more than two lines per bullet. </p>
	<p class="block_10">11.4.4. <b class="calibre2">Special Formatting.</b> Do not underline, capitalize, or use bold print, unusual fonts or characters, multiple exclamation marks, or headings to emphasize comments, except as required to identify proper names, publication titles, etc. </p>

This responsibility will be conducted by the immediate commander of the Airman at the lowest unit level. Sex-related offenses include violations of Article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual contact and abusive sexual contact), Article 125 (forcible sodomy, which is forced oral or anal sex, and bestiality), Article 120a (stalking), Article 120b (rape and sexual assault of a child), Article 120c (other sexual misconduct, which includes indecent viewing/recording/ broadcasting, forcible pandering, and indecent exposure) or attempts to commit any of those offenses.

	<p class="block_11">11.6.3.1. For officer evaluations, there must be a minimum number of days supervision; see AFI 36-2406, Tables 3.3 and 3.4 for the type of evaluation being prepared. There is no minimum number of days supervision required for enlisted evaluations. </p>
	<p class="block_11">11.6.3.2. Ensures the ratee is aware of who is in his or her rating chain. </p>
	<p class="block_11">11.6.3.3. Must provide an ACA IAW AFI 36-2406. Official documented ACA does not preclude a rater from performing day-to-day verbal assessments. Additionally, raters are required to perform an assessment at the time the evaluation is presented to the ratee. This assessment at the time the evaluation is presented, may be, but is not required to be officially documented on the ACA worksheet. If geographically separated, assessments can be performed electronically or telephonically. </p>
	<p class="block_11">11.6.3.4. Must consider the contents of any Unfavorable Information File and/or Personal Information File, if applicable, before preparing the performance evaluation. </p>

Exception: Interim first sergeants, additional duty first sergeants, or designated Senior NCOs may complete evaluation reviews when the organization’s 8F000/First Sergeant is unavailable due to extended absence (e.g. deployment, lengthy training, or lengthy convalescent leave).</p>
	<p class="block_10">11.6.7. <b class="calibre2">Ratee:</b></p>
	<p class="block_11">11.6.7.1. The ratee is equally responsible for ensuring they know their rating chain and that they received a timely ACA. </p>
	<p class="block_11">11.6.7.2. Ratee Review. Evaluations must be reviewed by the Ratee prior to becoming a matter of record. This is the time to review for typos, spelling, and inaccurate data and bring it to the attention of the Rater. If the data is administratively accurate and it is just a matter of the Ratee disagreeing with the content, the Rater is not required to change their assessment. When the Ratee signs the evaluation, he or she is not concurring with the content, but rather acknowledging receipt of the completed evaluation and is certifying that the Ratee has reviewed the evaluation for administrative errors. If the Ratee disagrees with the content, (comments and/or ratings) the Ratee may file an appeal IAW AFI 36-2406, after the evaluation becomes a matter of record. NOTE: An ACA form is not required upon completion of the OPR/EPR. The OPR/EPR serves as official documentation of the feedback provided to the Ratee.</p>
	<p class="block_19">11.7. Rater/Ratee Accountability. </p>
	<p class="block_10">Raters ensure Airmen they supervise receive an ACA to improve performance and contributions to mission accomplishment. To assist raters in preparing evaluations, all commissioned officers and enlisted members who are on active duty or in an active status in a Reserve Component, shall report (in writing) to their rater within 72 hours, any conviction for a violation of a criminal law of the United States or violations of a criminal law of any other country—whether or not the member is on active duty or in an active status at the time of the conduct that provides the basis for the conviction—to the member’s rater (first-line military supervisor) or summary courts-martial convening authority. In the case of a member of the individual ready reserve, standby reserve, or ANG, all commissioned officers and enlisted members shall report (in writing) to their wing commanders (or equivalent), in accordance with the requirements below within 30 days. (Note: While the National Defense Authorization Act provision only extended the mandatory reporting to E-7s and above, the Secretary of the Air Force has determined that any member within the United States Air Force must report covered convictions, therefore, extends the mandate to all grades). </p>
	<p class="block_10">11.7.1. <b class="calibre2">When to Document.</b> In deciding whether to document adverse information on the performance evaluation, evaluators must consider the vast majority of Airmen serve their entire career with honor and distinction; therefore, failure to document misconduct which reflects departure from the core values of the Air Force is a disservice to all Airmen competing for promotion. Additionally, evaluators must consider items listed below when assessing performance and potential, and specifically mention them in evaluations when appropriate. </p>
	<p class="block_11">11.7.1.1. Impact of the misconduct on the Air Force mission (Did the mission suffer in any way? Was unit morale affected?).</p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.1.1.1. All commissioned officers, and enlisted members above the pay grade of E-6 (E-7 and above), who are on active duty or in an active status in a Reserve Component, shall report in writing any conviction of such member for a violation of a criminal law of the United States—whether or not the member is on active duty or in an active status at the time of the conduct that provides the basis for the conviction—to the member’s first-line military supervisor or summary court-martial convening authority, or in the case of a member of the individual ready reserve, standby reserve, or ANG to the Air Reserve Personnel Center or Air National Guard Bureau, whichever is applicable, in accordance with the requirements below. </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.1.1.2. For purposes of this policy, the term “conviction” includes a plea or finding of guilty, a plea of <i class="calibre1">nolo contendere (no contest), </i>and all other actions tantamount to a finding of guilty, including adjudication withheld, deferred prosecution, entry into adult or juvenile pretrial intervention programs, and any similar disposition of charges. </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.1.1.3. For purposes of this policy, a criminal law of the United States includes any military or other Federal criminal law; any State, district, commonwealth, or territorial or equivalent criminal law or ordinance; and any criminal law or ordinance of any county, parish, municipality, or local subdivision of any such authority, other than motor vehicle violations that do not involve a court appearance. </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.1.1.4. Regular Air Force members shall submit reports within 15 days of the date the conviction is announced, even if sentence has not been imposed or the member intends to appeal the conviction. Air Reserve Component members not on active duty but in an active status shall submit reports at the first drill period after the date the conviction is announced, or within 30 days of the date the conviction is announced, whichever is earlier, even if sentence has not been imposed or the member intends to appeal the conviction. All members who must submit evidence of their conviction, must maintain evidence of compliance with this requirement. </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.1.1.5. In the event a commander or military law-enforcement official receives information that a covered member of the Armed Forces under the jurisdiction of another military department has become subject to a conviction for which a report is required by this section, the commander or military law-enforcement official receiving such information shall forward it to the member’s immediate commander. If the member’s immediate commander cannot be readily identified, the commander or military law-enforcement official receiving the information shall forward it to the office designated by the member’s military department identified as required below. </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.1.1.6. Each Service shall institute procedures to ensure that the members covered by the law comply with its requirements and the policy set forth in this memorandum. These procedures shall include points of contact for other military departments to comply with the notification requirements above. Each Service shall also establish points of contact to which Reserve Component members in the individual ready reserve or standby reserve who may not know the identity or address of their first line military supervisor or summary court-martial convening authority may provide information of a conviction. </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.1.2. Impact of the misconduct on the Air Force as an institution (Did it bring discredit on the Air Force?). </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.1.3. Impact of the misconduct on, and its relationship to the ratee’s duties (Did it affect the ratee’s ability to fulfill his or her duties?). </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.1.3.1. Impact of the misconduct on the Air Force mission (Did the mission suffer in any way? Was unit morale affected?). </p>

	<p class="block_4">11.7.1.3.3. Impact of the misconduct on, and its relationship to the ratee’s duties (Did it affect the member’s ability to fulfill his or her duties?). </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.1.3.4. Grade, assignment and experience of the ratee (Is the ratee in a “sensitive” job? Did the ratee “know better”?). </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.1.3.5. Number of separate violations and frequency of the misconduct (Is this an isolated or repeated incident?). </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.1.3.6. Consequences of the misconduct (Did it result in death, injury, or loss of/damage to military or civilian property?). </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.1.3.7. Other dissimilar acts of misconduct during the reporting period (Is the ratee establishing a pattern of misconduct?). </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.1.3.8. Existence of unique, unusual or extenuating circumstances (Was the misconduct willful and unprovoked, or were there aggravating factors or events?). </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.1.4. Grade, assignment, and experience of the ratee (Is the ratee in a “sensitive” job? Did the ratee “know better”?). </p>

	<p class="block_4">11.7.1.8. Existence of unique, unusual, or extenuating circumstances (Was the misconduct willful and unprovoked, or were there aggravating factors or events?). </p>
	<p class="block_3">11.7.2. <b class="calibre2">What to Report.</b> Adverse Actions: For the purpose of this policy, “adverse action” includes: </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.2.1. Reportable Civilian Offenses. A conviction of a Federal criminal law; any State, district, commonwealth, or territorial or equivalent criminal law or ordinance; or any criminal law or ordinance of any county, parish, municipality, city, township, or local subdivision of any such authority, and convictions of any foreign criminal law; other than convictions for motor vehicle violations that do not require a court appearance. Specifically, convictions required to be reported include the following: 1) any finding of guilt; 2) any plea of guilty; 3) any plea of no contest or <i class="calibre1">nolo contendere</i>; 4) any plea of guilty in exchange for a deferred prosecution or diversion program, and/or; 5) any other similar disposition of civilian criminal charges. </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.2.1.1. Any citation or violation of a motor vehicle offense which ultimately results in a conviction of a lesser included offense (resulting from the original citation) is not reportable if the lesser included offense would not have required a court appearance. For example, a member who is charged with reckless driving (an offense requiring a court appearance), but is found guilty of speeding (an offense not requiring a court appearance) has not been convicted of an offense requiring reporting. Commanders and/or supervisors who have questions regarding whether a particular conviction triggers the mandated comment should consult with their staff judge advocate. </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.2.1.2. In the event a commander or military law-enforcement official receives information that a member of the Air Force, under the jurisdiction of another military department, has become subject to a conviction for which a report is required by this section, the commander or military law-enforcement official receiving such information shall forward it to the member’s immediate commander. If the member’s immediate commander cannot be readily identified, the commander or military law-enforcement official receiving the information shall forward it to the office designated by the member’s military department identified as required below. </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.2.1.3. Procedures shall be instituted to ensure members covered by the law comply with its requirements and the policy as stated in this instruction. These procedures shall include points of contact for other military departments to comply with the notification requirements above. Points of contact shall also be established with the Reserve Component members in the individual ready reserve or standby reserve who may not know the identity or address of their first line military supervisor or summary court-martial convening authority may provide information of a conviction covered under this policy. </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.2.2. Complaints of sex-related offenses against a member, regardless of grade, resulting in conviction by court-martial, non-judicial punishment, or punitive administrative action require a mandatory notation on the member’s next EPR, OPR, or Training Report, and Promotion Recommendation Form (if not already documented on an evaluation or court-martial in the officer’s selection record). Sex-related offenses include violations of Article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual contact and abusive sexual contact), Article 125 (forcible sodomy, which is forced oral or anal sex, and bestiality), Article 120a (stalking), Article 120b (rape and sexual assault of a child), Article 120c (other sexual misconduct, which includes indecent viewing/recording/ broadcasting, forcible pandering, and indecent exposure) or attempts to commit any of those offenses. The effective date of the requirement for notation is 26 Dec 13. </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.2.3. If a member has been convicted by a court-martial or if the Senior Rater decides to file any adverse information in an Airman’s Officer Selection Record or Senior Non-Commissioned Officer Selection Record, comments relating to the ratee’s behavior are mandatory on the ratee’s next OPR, EPR or Training Report, and Promotion Recommendation Form (if not already documented on an evaluation or court-martial in the Officer Selection Record or Senior Non-Commissioned Officer Selection Record). The evaluation becomes a referral for the OPR, EPR, and Training Report. Comments are also required on Airmen who have been convicted of a “reportable civilian offense” that: 1) is a sexual offense that is the same as, or closely related to, Uniform Code of Military Justice, Articles 120, 120a, 120b, 120c, 125, or attempts to commit any of those offenses; 2) carries a possible sentence of confinement for more than one year, or death; or 3) resulted in a sentence that included unsuspended confinement. For guidance on interpreting this paragraph and sub-paragraphs, supervisors and commanders should consult the servicing staff judge advocate. </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.2.3.1. A rater is not required to comment on the conviction in a current report if, during a previous rating period, the rater already commented on the underlying misconduct that ultimately resulted in the conviction. For example: In a case where a member is arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence by off-base officials who decline to waive jurisdiction, the member’s commander issues the member an Letter of Reprimand based on the evidence, and then comments on the Driving Under the Influence Letter of Reprimand in the ratee’s next evaluation. Then, the downtown prosecution results in a conviction during a future reporting period. In such a case, the rater is not required to comment on the Driving Under the Influence conviction because the underlying misconduct that led to the conviction was already addressed in a previous evaluation. </p>
	<p class="block_3">11.7.3. <b class="calibre2">Extraordinary Cases</b>. Raters may request a waiver of the mandatory requirement to document civilian convictions for good cause. The waiver request will route from the rater, through any required additional rater and the ratee’s commander, to the ratee’s Senior Rater. The Senior Rater may either deny the waiver request or endorse the request and forward to the Major Command Commander (or in the case of reports within Air Force District of Washington, United States Air Force Academy, or any Direct Reporting Unit or Field Operating Agency reporting to an activity on the Air Staff, to the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, or in the case of the ANG, to the Director, Air National Guard). The Director, Air National Guard may delegate this authority to the respective state’s Adjutant General, or equivalent for Territories and the District of Columbia, who will make determinations after consultation with the Director, Air National Guard, or the Deputy Director, Air National Guard. Both the nature and the outcome of the offense for each approved waiver will remain on file with the Director, Air National Guard. No further delegation is authorized. </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.3.1. If the Senior Rater denies the waiver request, the decision regarding the waiver request is final and may not be appealed or considered further. This does not prevent an individual from challenging any completed report in any other appropriate forums, e.g., Evaluation Reports Appeal Board, Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records. </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.3.1.1. When the Senior Rater endorses the waiver request and forwards it to the final approval authority (Major Command Commander, Vice Chief of Staff, or Director, Air National Guard), the final approval authority can either approve the exception, allowing the exclusion of any comments in the EPR, OPR, Training Report, and Promotion Recommendation Form, or deny the request, resulting in the mandatory inclusion of comments regarding the ratee’s criminal behavior. </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.7.3.1.2. The final approval authority is delegable to the Major Command/CV or, in the case of the Air Force/CV, to the Air Force/CVA; no further delegation beyond a The Adjutant General, or equivalent, is authorized for the ANG. The decision of the approval authority is the final decision for such waiver requests and may not be appealed or considered further. This does not prevent an individual from challenging any completed report in any other appropriate forums, e.g., Evaluation Reports Appeal Board, Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records. </p>
	<p class="block_4"> 11.7.3.1.3. In order to approve any waiver requests, the approval authority must issue a written finding that the mandatory comments for the specific criminal conviction are not in the best interests of the Air Force and that the inclusion of any such comments would unduly harm the ratee. Upon final decision, the final approval authority will forward the waiver documentation to Air Force Personnel Center/DP3SP via email <span class="text_81">and Air Force Personnel Center/DP2SSM via email. Written waiver approvals will be filed in the member’s Master Personnel Records Group for the sole purpose of documenting the final approval. </span></p>
	<p class="block_10">11.7.4. <b class="calibre2">Comments.</b> In all cases, when comments are included in performance evaluations, they must be specific, outlining the event and any corrective action taken. Comments such as “conduct unbecoming…” or “an error in judgment led to an off-duty incident…” are too vague. Examples of valid comments are “Master Sergeant Smith drove while intoxicated, for which he received an Article 15” and “Capt Jones made improper sexually suggestive and harassing comments to a squadron member, for which he received a letter of reprimand.” </p>
	<p class="block_10">11.7.5. <b class="calibre2">Organizational Climate.</b> Organizational climate is defined as the way in which members in a unit perceive and characterize their unit environment. All Airmen are responsible for creating an organizational climate in which every member is treated with dignity and respect, and one that does not tolerate unlawful discrimination, sexual harassment, or sexual assault in any form. NCOs and officers are not only responsible for creating this environment but are also accountable for it. NCOs and officers can build a healthy organizational climate by: communicating clear direction at all levels of supervision; adhering to and enforcing standards; not tolerating and, when necessary, appropriately responding to any form of sexual harassment, sexual assault, hazing, unlawful discrimination, or any other conduct harmful to the good order and discipline of the unit; being accountable for their actions; and cultivating an environment where teamwork, unity and cohesiveness are the standard practice. </p>
	<p class="block_11">11.7.5.1. All NCO and officer evaluators will assess their ratee(s) on what the member did to ensure a healthy organizational climate. </p>
	<p class="block_11">11.7.5.2. Commanders at every level have an even greater responsibility to create a healthy climate in their command. Additionally, they are responsible for ensuring adherence to Sexual Assault Prevention Program directives. Command climate, just like organizational climate, is the perception of a unit’s environment by its members. Commanders are ultimately responsible for the good order and discipline in their unit and have unique responsibility and authority to ensure good order and discipline. Therefore, evaluators must take this special responsibility and authority into consideration when evaluating a commander’s effectiveness in ensuring a healthy command climate. </p>
	<p class="block_10">11.7.6. <b class="calibre2">Equal Opportunity and Treatment.</b> The expectation is fair and equal treatment of all and enforcement of the same behavior in subordinates. Evaluators must consider a member’s commitment to Equal Opportunity and Treatment when evaluating performance and making a promotion recommendation. The goal is to ensure fair, accurate, and unbiased evaluations to help ensure the best qualified members are identified for positions of higher responsibility. Evaluations must reflect serious or repeated occurrences of discrimination, to include sexual harassment, as prescribed in AFI 36-2706, <i class="calibre1">Military Equal Opportunity Program</i>.</p>
	<p class="block_1">Section 11C—Performance Feedback</p>
	<p class="block_2">11.8. Purpose.</p>
	<p class="block_3">ACA is formal communication between a rater and ratee to communicate responsibility, accountability, Air Force culture, an Airman’s critical role in support of the mission, individual readiness, and performance feedback on expectations regarding duty performance and how well the ratee is meeting those expectations to include information to assist the ratee in achieving success. It is intended to increase Airmen interaction and support at all levels. If done correctly, mentorship will create and sustain a culture of belonging. The ACA is also intended to provide Airmen an opportunity to discuss their personal and professional goals. Raters document the session on the ACA worksheet and use the Performance Feedback in Section VI to assess or discuss the objectives, standards, behavior, and performance with the ratee. Providing this information helps an individual contribute to positive communication, improve performance, and grow professionally. The following information applies to all military personnel.</p>
	<p class="block_12">11.9. Responsibilities:</p>
	<p class="block_10">11.9.1. The ratee will: </p>
	<p class="block_11">11.9.1.1. Know when ACA sessions are due. </p>
	<p class="block_11">11.9.1.2. If a ratee requests a feedback session, the rater will provide one within 30 days of receipt of the request, provided 60 days have passed, since the last feedback session (i.e., Ratee Requested). </p>

	<p class="block_10">11.9.2. The rater will: </p>
	<p class="block_11">11.9.2.1. Conduct ACA sessions as required by this instruction. In addition, ACA sessions will be conducted at the ratee’s request or when deemed necessary (provided 60 days have passed since the last ACA session [i.e., Rater Directed]). </p>
	<p class="block_11">11.9.2.2. Prepare for, schedule, and conduct ACA sessions (avoid conflicts with TDY, leave, etc., when possible), regardless of whether the rater received an ACA notice. </p>
	<p class="block_11">11.9.2.3. Understand Air Force standards and expectations and consider them when providing ACA to personnel. </p>
	<p class="block_11">11.9.2.4. Provide realistic assessments to help the ratee improve performance and grow professionally and personally. Realistic assessments include in-depth discussions with the ratee and written comments on the ACA worksheet, not just marks on the form. </p>
	<p class="block_11">11.9.2.5. Provide the original completed and signed ACA worksheet to the ratee.</p>
	<p class="block_4">11.9.2.6. Retain a copy of the signed and dated ACA notice and worksheet. The Midterm ACA is a required, mandatory supporting document to be routed with the Performance Evaluation (EPR/OPR), however, will not be made a matter of the official record. In addition, the Rater will retain a copy of the initial and midterm ACA as this may be needed for any future appeals. </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.9.2.7. The ACA is a communication tool and is not to be used to discover or document behavior which may result in administrative or judicial action. NOTE: It is important that behavior representing a significant deviation from expected standards is recorded in other administrative forms (i.e. Letter of Reprimand, Letter of Counseling, Letter of Admonishment, Memorandum for Record, etc.). </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.9.2.8. Provide the ratee with the most current Air Force Benefits Fact Sheet. </p>

	<p class="block_3">11.9.5. The Military Personnel Section will: </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.9.5.1. Provide ACA notices to raters and ratees. ANG does not currently have standardized automated process to create ACA notices for raters and ratees. ANG Military Personnel Sections may utilize an alternate form of communication to notify all raters and ratees of ACA schedules. </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.9.5.2. Not be required to maintain repository for ACAs for personnel assigned to wing. </p>
	<p class="block_3">11.9.6. Unit will: </p>
	<p class="block_4">11.9.6.1. At the unit commander’s request, develop a tracking mechanism to ensure ACAs are conducted. It is the responsibility of individual raters to maintain copies of all completed ACAs and all signed ACA notices (or appropriate statements) on their assigned ratees (Regular Air Force only). </p>
	<p class="block_2">11.10. Who Requires an ACA. </p>
	<p class="block_3">ACAs are mandatory for officers, second lieutenant through colonel, and all Regular Air Force and Air Reserve Component personnel. If an individual requests an ACA session, the rater will provide one within 30 days of receipt of the request, provided 60 days have passed since the last ACA session. Do not prepare an ACA when a ratee is a captive, patient, prisoner, absent without leave, etc. For student officers receiving AF Forms 475, ACA is not required, but may be given at the discretion of the commander of the school. For student enlisted personnel, in approved initial skills training or advanced skills training courses an ACA is not required, but may be given at the discretion of the commander of the school. For those performance evaluations completed on non-rated initial skills training or advanced skills training course students, academic progress reports, such as the AETC Form 156 Student Training Report, captured in the Technical Training Management System or an equivalent document utilized by non-AETC institutions of instruction, will serve in-lieu of the mandatory mid-term ACA. ACAs are <span class="text_80">not </span>required for Airmen who have Permanent Change of Station to prisoner status in a long term military confinement facility owned by the Air Force Security Forces Center. </p>
	<p class="block_2">11.11. Guidance for Conducting ACA Sessions. </p>
	<p class="block_3">ACA sessions will be conducted face-to-face. EXCEPTION: Raters may conduct sessions by telephone only in unusual circumstances where face-to-face sessions are impractical, such as when the rater and ratee are geographically separated or the rater and/or ratee is on extended TDY. When a telephonic session is conducted, the rater forwards the ACA worksheet to the ratee to complete Section III and review for discussion Section VII. The finalized form is forwarded to the ratee within 10 calendar days after the session. </p>
	<p class="block_20"><b class="calibre2">11.12. When to Hold Documented ACA Sessions. </b>See Table 11.1.</p>
	<p class="block_21">11.13. The ACA Notice:</p>
	<p class="block_22">11.13.1. The rater should receive a computer-generated ACA notice 30 days after supervision begins (identifying initial or follow-up ACA sessions as required) and again halfway between the time supervision began and the projected performance report close-out date (identifying mid-term ACA session requirement). This notice serves to remind raters that an ACA session is due; however, failure to receive an ACA notice does not justify failing to hold a required session. </p>
	<p class="block_22">11.13.2. Since the ratee shares the responsibility to ensure ACA sessions are conducted, an ACA notice is also sent to the ratee, through his or her unit, 30 days after sending the notice to the rater (for officers) or concurrently with the notice sent to the rater (for enlisted). </p>

	<p class="block_4">11.15.7.1. Since the primary purpose of the initial ACA session is to establish expectations for the upcoming rating period, a rater is not expected to have already developed a clear-cut opinion of an individual’s performance by the time the session is conducted.

	<p class="block_4">11.15.7.2. For all other ACA types, the rater will indicate how the ratee is meeting the established expectations by marking one block under each main heading. These markings translate to an aggregate rating on the performance evaluation, and provide an indication of how the ratee is meeting the expectations set forth by the rater while providing the basis for the ACA session discussion. </p>
	<p class="block_3">11.15.8. AF Form 931, Section VII<i class="calibre1">, Followership/Leadership</i>, documents an Airman’s ability to lead and develop subordinates and exercise effective followership in mission accomplishment. The Followership/Leadership section has four sub-sections to select from for each performance factor. The rater places a mark in the appropriate block which indicates the ratee’s level of performance. </p>
	<p class="block_3">11.15.9. AF Form 931, Section VIII, and AF Form 932, Section VII, <i class="calibre1">Whole Airman Concept</i>, consider the Airman’s interpersonal relations that directly influence behavior and values, level of effort to improve themselves personally and professionally, and their devotion and enthusiasm. This section has three sub-sections for both Airman Basic thru Technical Sergeant,<i class="calibre1"> </i>and Master Sergeant thru Chief Master Sergeant<i class="calibre1"> </i>to select from for each performance factor. The rater places a mark in the appropriate block which indicates the ratee’s level of performance. </p>
	<p class="block_3">11.15.10. AF Form 931, Section IX,<i class="calibre1"> </i>and AF Form 932, Section VIII, <i class="calibre1">Knowing Your Airman</i>, provides questions designed to facilitate open communication between the ratee/rater and may trigger areas and/or specific items which need to be probed in more depth. These questions are not intended to be all encompassing. The purpose is to help start the conversation on the particular item, not make it an interrogation. AF Form 931 items 6 and 7 are designed to receive feedback from the ratee and to set specific expectations for the ratee’s growth.</p>

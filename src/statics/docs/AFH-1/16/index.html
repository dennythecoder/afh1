	<p class="block_1">WING SUPPORT</p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 16A—Overview</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.1. Introduction.</p>
	<p class="block_4">Wing Support is filled with information every Airman can use on a daily basis to assist them along in their career. Air Force Portal, entitlements, legal services, ground safety along with risk management, and the procedures for prevention of and response to sexual assault are some of the topics covered. The chapter serves as a great guide to assist you if you shall ever need information on any of these topics. More importantly though, as you become supervisor, mentor or friend having a working knowledge of topics covered in this chapter is vital to helping you be a great Wingman.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 16B—Air Force Portal</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.2. Air Force Portal Simplifies Access:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>In 2000, the United States Air Force launched the Air Force Portal to simplify access to information. The mission of the Air Force Portal is to provide ready access to the latest Air Force information, services, and combat support applications. Since first introduced, the Air Force Portal has changed the way we do business. Every day this technology helps us connect, collaborate, and perform our duties in service to our nation. Access is available anytime, anywhere, from any Internet-connected computer whether at home, at the office, or deployed with a valid Department of Defense public key infrastructure certificate, such as a common access card.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>The Air Force Portal provides a single point of entry to Web-based information, self-service applications, collaboration and networking tools, and combat support systems, many without requiring a separate user identification and password. Users have access to key applications like total force awareness training, myPay, Air Force virtual education center, Air Force fitness management system, virtual military personnel flight, LeaveWeb, Training Business Area, Enterprise-Solution-Supply and many more. On the library page, you can access online periodicals, do research, and find valuable education and training materials. The Portal is the entry point to the Global Combat Support System Air Force. The goal of Global Combat Support System Air Force is to provide timely, accurate, and trusted combat support information to joint and Air Force commanders at all echelons.</p>
	<p class="block_5">16.2.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Tremendous growth continues, with the number of active registered Air Force and Department of Defense users now over 725,000, with over 400,000 average logins per week, and serving millions of web pages per day. Provides one location for all areas—information, collaboration, and applications—so you can do your job, manage your career, and live your life in the Air Force.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 16C—Military Pay, Allowances, and Entitlements</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.3. Military Pay and Allowances.</p>
	<p class="block_4">Department of Defense 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, <i class="calibre2">Military Pay Policy—Active Duty and Reserve Pay, </i>The Joint Travel Regulation and Air Force Manual 65-116, Volume 1, <i class="calibre2">Defense Joint Military Pay System Active Component FSO Procedures</i>, contain guidance on pay and allowances and related entitlements.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Military (Basic) Pay:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">16.3.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Basic pay is the fundamental component of military pay and typically, the largest component of a member’s pay. Every member is entitled to basic pay while on active duty, with some exceptions such as: during periods of unauthorized absence, excess leave, or after an enlistment expires. Annual military pay raises are set by Congress and the President in the National Defense Authorization Act. In accordance with Federal Law (37 United States Code 1009) the January 1 annual pay raise will automatically match the private sector wage increases, as measured by the Employment Cost Index for the previous year. If, because of national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare, the President may submit a plan to Congress requesting a lower annual pay raise.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.3.1.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Grade and length of military service determine the actual rate of basic pay. Military pay date is important because this date determines the length of service for pay purposes. In general, the pay date should be the same date the individual entered on active duty if he or she had no prior service before entering the Air Force. However, if the individual previously served in certain governmental agencies the Air Force adjusts the pay date to reflect credit for these periods. Periods of absence without leave, desertion, and sickness or injury due to personal misconduct will result in negative pay date adjustments.</p>
	<p class="block_7"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">16.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> Leave and Earnings Statement.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Defense Finance and Accounting Service Form 702, <i class="calibre2">Defense Finance and Accounting Service Military Leave and Earnings Statement</i>, is a comprehensive statement of a member’s entitlements, deductions, allotments, leave information, tax-withholding information, and Traditional Thrift Savings Plan and the Roth Thrift Savings Plan information. Verify and keep your leave and earnings statement each month with increased attention when returning from deployment or when making changes such as marriage, divorce, or birth of a child. If your pay varies significantly and you don’t understand why or if you have any questions, consult your servicing finance office. The myPay system allows members to view their leave and earnings statement as well as initiate changes to selected items affecting their pay.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.4. Military Allowances and Entitlements.</p>
	<p class="block_4">Allowances are monies provided for specific needs such as food or housing. Monetary allowances are provided when the government does not provide for that specific need. For example, the quantity of government housing is not sufficient to house all military members and their families. Those who live in government housing do not receive full housing allowances. Those who do not live in government housing receive allowances to assist with the cost of obtaining commercial housing. The most common allowances are basic allowance for subsistence and basic allowance for housing. Most members receive both of these allowances, and in many cases, these allowances comprise a significant portion of the member’s total pay. Other than continental United States cost-of-living allowance, allowances are not taxable, which is an additional embedded benefit of military pay.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.4.1.<b class="calibre1"> Basic Allowance for Subsistence.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Basic allowance for subsistence is a nontaxable allowance used to offset the cost of the service member’s meals. Most junior grade enlisted members assigned to single-type government quarters at their permanent duty station are required to eat in the government dining facilities, receive basic allowance for subsistence, and are charged the discounted meal rate which is deducted from their pay. When certified by the commanding officer or designee, members are allowed to claim reimbursement for missed meals.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> Housing Allowances.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Housing allowances are based on member’s grade, dependency status, and duty location. The location determines whether the allowance is basic allowance for housing or overseas housing allowance. In some cases, members who are not able to take their families to the permanent duty station are eligible for payment of family separation housing allowance in addition to basic allowance for housing or overseas housing allowance.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.4.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Basic Allowance for Housing.</b> The intent of basic allowance for housing is to provide uniformed service members accurate and equitable housing compensation based on housing costs in local civilian housing markets. This allowance is payable when government quarters are not provided. Many Air Force installations have privatized their quarters, meaning that private contractors have taken over much of the previously Air Force-owned-and-operated family housing. Members in these privatized quarters are entitled to basic allowance for housing, and the rental agreement requires a rent amount not to exceed the basic allowance for housing entitlement paid via allotment. Members without dependents residing in government single-type quarters are entitled to partial basic allowance for housing unless the quarters (including government-leased quarters) exceed the minimum standards of single quarters for their grade. Members living in single-type government quarters who pay court-ordered child support may qualify for differential (basic allowance for housing-Differential). The leave and earning statement displays the basic allowance for housing rate below the heading ENTITLEMENTS, listed as basic allowance for housing. The PAY DATA portion of the leave and earning statement shows the basic allowance for housing type and basic allowance for housing dependents, as well as other housing-related data.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.4.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> Overseas Housing Allowance.</b> Overseas housing allowance is a cost reimbursement-based allowance to help defray housing costs incident to assignments to a permanent duty station outside the United States. Members are reimbursed actual rental costs not to exceed the maximum overseas housing allowance rate for each locality, grade, and dependency status. There are two types of allowances paid under overseas housing allowance: move-in housing allowance and monthly overseas housing allowance including a utility/recurring maintenance allowance. The location move-in housing allowance (for those who qualify) is based on the average “move-in” costs for members. The monthly overseas housing allowance is the rent, up to the rental allowance at a permanent duty station, plus the utility/recurring maintenance allowance.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.4.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Family Separation Housing.</b> The purpose of family separation housing is to pay a member for added housing expenses resulting from enforced separation from dependents. There are two types of family separation housing: family separation housing –basic allowance for housing and family separation housing-overseas housing allowance. Family separation housing –basic allowance for housing is payable in a monthly amount equal to the without-dependent basic allowance for housing rate applicable to the member’s grade and permanent duty station. Family separation housing-overseas housing allowance is payable in a monthly amount up to the without-dependent overseas housing allowance rate applicable to the member’s grade and permanent duty station. For additional guidance, consult the Joint Travel Regulation at <a href="http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/travelreg.cfm" class="text_">http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/travelreg.cfm</a>.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.4.3.<b class="calibre1"> Clothing Replacement Allowance.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Enlisted military members receive an annual allowance to help maintain, repair, and replace initial issue uniform items as necessary. There are two types of clothing replacement allowance: clothing replacement allowance Basic, a preliminary replacement allowance paid annually between the 6th and 36th month of active duty; and clothing replacement allowance Standard, an allowance that automatically replaces clothing replacement allowance Basic after 36 months of active duty. Entitlement to either allowance depends on the individual’s “entered on active duty date” in his or her master military pay account. This allowance is paid at the end of the member’s anniversary month and appears on the leave and earning statement opposite CLOTHING under the ENTITLEMENTS heading.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.4.4.<b class="calibre1"> Family Separation Allowance.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Family separation allowance is a type of allowance payable to members with dependents in addition to any other allowance or per diem to which a member may be entitled. Family separation allowance has three different categories: family separation allowance-restricted, family separation allowance-serving on ships, and family separation allowance-temporary. A member may not receive more than one payment of family separation allowance for the same period, even though qualified for family separation allowance-restricted and family separation allowance-serving on ships or family separation allowance-temporary. The purpose of family separation allowance is to compensate qualified members for added expenses incurred because of an enforced family separation. Members are eligible for family separation allowance-restricted if transportation of dependents, including dependents acquired after effective date of orders, is not authorized at government expense, and the dependents do not live in the vicinity of the member’s permanent duty station. Family separation allowance-serving on ships applies to members serving on ships away from the homeport continuously for more than 30 days. A member is eligible for family separation allowance-temporary if the member is on temporary duty away from the permanent station continuously for more than 30 days, and the member’s dependents are not residing at or near the temporary duty station. This includes members required to perform a period of the temporary duty before reporting to their initial station of assignment.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.4.5.<b class="calibre1"> Station Allowances outside the Continental United States.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The aim of overseas station allowances is to help defray the higher than normal cost of living or cost in procuring housing in overseas areas. Allowances the Department of Defense authorizes only at certain overseas locations include temporary lodging allowance and cost-of-living allowance. Members receive information regarding their specific entitlements during in-processing at the new location. Members may also receive information from their local finance office upon notification of a pending overseas assignment.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.4.6. <b class="calibre1">Continental United States Cost-of-Living Allowance.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Continental Unites States cost-of-living allowance is payable to members assigned to designated “high cost” areas within the continental Unites States. For additional information, see Joint Travel Regulation, chapter 8.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.5. Special and Incentive Pay.</p>
	<p class="block_4">A number of special and incentive pays recognize certain aspects of duty, including, but not limited to hazardous duty incentive pay, imminent danger pay, special duty assignment pay, enlisted flying duty incentive pay, and hardship duty pay-location. Also included are enlistment and reenlistment bonuses.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.6. Deductions.</p>
	<p class="block_4">The two general categories of payroll deductions are involuntary and voluntary deductions.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.6.1.<b class="calibre1"> Involuntary Deductions:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">16.6.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> Withholding Income Tax:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">16.6.1.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Department of Defense 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Chapter 44, outlines specific taxable and nontaxable items. All “pay” is considered income for federal and state income tax purposes (for example, basic pay, incentive pay, special pay, lump-sum payment of accrued leave, and separation pay). Allowances considered nontaxable on 9 September 1986 remain nontaxable. For example, basic allowance for subsistence remains nontaxable and continental United States cost-of-living allowance is taxable.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.6.1.1.2. The leave and earning statement reflects the current month and year-to-date income for social security, federal income tax, and state income tax purposes under the headings “FICA TAXES,” “FED TAXES,” and “STATE TAXES” in the middle of the form. Defense Finance and Accounting Service is responsible for ensuring the leave and earning statement provides the necessary pay and entitlement information.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.6.1.2.<b class="calibre1"> Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) Taxes. </b>The FICA requires federal agencies to withhold FICA (Social Security and Medicare) taxes from the basic pay of military members covered by the Social Security Act and to pay matching FICA taxes to the Social Security Administration.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.6.1.3.<b class="calibre1"> Federal Income Tax Withholding (FITW). </b>FITW is used to provide for national programs such as defense, community development, and law enforcement. The FITW complies with the Treasury Department Circular E as implemented in military service directives. A member may authorize an additional monthly amount of FITW.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.6.1.4.<b class="calibre1"> State Income Tax Withholding (SITW). </b>The tax laws of the state where the member is a legal resident determine whether the member must pay state taxes. The amount withheld depends upon the state tax rate. One-time payments may also be subject to state tax. The state for tax purposes is reflected in the first column on the leave and earning statement under STATE TAXES.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.6.1.5.<b class="calibre1"> Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH). </b>Monthly deductions from the pay of regular enlisted members, up to a maximum of $1, are set by the Secretary of Defense after consulting with the AFRH Board. The money helps support the United States Soldiers’, Airmen’s and Naval Homes.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.6.2.<b class="calibre1"> Voluntary Deductions:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">16.6.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Military members may establish voluntary deductions such as allotments to help administer their personal finances. Effective January 1, 2015, members are not authorized to start allotments for the purchase, lease, or rental of personal property. Personal property includes vehicles (e.g., automobiles, motorcycles, or boats), appliances or household goods (e.g., a washer, dryer, furniture), electronics (e.g., laptop, tablet, cellphone, or television), and other consumer items that are tangible and movable. Members may also have an allotment for a personal savings program, support of family members, and payment of insurance premiums. Members may control certain discretionary allotments through myPay however, there can be no more than one discretionary allotment to the same allottee. Nondiscretionary allotments have limited uses, such as charitable contributions, loan repayment to the Air Force Aid Society, garnishment for commercial debts, and delinquent travel charge card debt.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.6.2.2. To allow for sufficient processing time, allotments should be requested about 30 days before the desired month. Occasionally, an allotment transaction may occur after the cutoff date for the mid-month payday. This will result in the entire amount of the allotment being deducted from the end-of-month pay. Normally, if the member is paid twice a month, the allotment is deducted in equal amounts from the mid-month and end-of-month pay. If the individual receives pay once a month, the entire amount is deducted from the monthly paycheck. There are certain cutoff dates that affect when allotments can be processed. Contact your local finance office for assistance.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.6.2.3. The maximum amount of service members’ Group Life Insurance coverage is $400,000 and members are covered, by law, at the maximum rate unless they decline or reduce coverage. Service members’ Group Life Insurance automatically insures an eligible member against death when the member is performing active duty or active duty for training for an ordered period of more than 30 days. However, an individual may choose less coverage in amounts divisible by $50,000 or elect no coverage, but he or she must do so in writing. Additionally, family service members’ Group Life Insurance covers spouses and dependent children when the eligible member also participates in Service members’ Group Life Insurance coverage, including military spouses. There is a monthly deduction for spousal coverage: the amount of the deduction depends on the amount of coverage. Each child is covered in the amount of $10,000 at no cost to the member. The member may not elect to insure any child for less than $10,000. Service members’ Group Life Insurance and Family service members’ Group Life Insurance premiums are deducted from members’ military pay each month. The military personnel section is the office of primary responsibility for administering the program.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.7. Military Pay Schedules:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.7.1. <b class="calibre1">Regular Payments.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Military members are paid on a monthly basis with the option to receive payments once or twice per month. Members receive a statement (net pay advice) of the net amount pay and the financial organization to which statement was sent at mid-month (if receiving a payment) and a comprehensive statement of pay, the leave and earning statement, at the end of the month via myPay. These statements are created centrally by Defense Finance and Accounting Service. Military members must understand the pay system has processing cutoff dates that affect updates to their pay. The cutoff date is the day when Defense Finance and Accounting Service stops processing transactions against pay accounts for the current period so the regular payroll process can begin. The cutoff is necessary to compute, prepare, and transfer funds. While the cutoff dates fluctuate from month to month, they are generally around the 6th for the mid-month payday and the 20th for the end-of-month payday.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.7.2.<b class="calibre1"> Local, Partial, and Emergency Partial Payments.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Local cash payments are normally only authorized for overseas areas where on base military banking facilities are not readily available. Exceptions may be granted for members assigned to classified or contingency operations where the exigencies of their assignments may require local cash or partial payments. Under extenuating circumstances, a stateside member may receive an emergency partial payment if the payment is deemed time sensitive and required within 24 hours due to an unforeseen set of circumstances. The member’s commander may authorize immediate cash payments up to the amount of accrued entitlement to date when deemed appropriate to the mission. Non-cash partial payments may be made, via electronic funds transfer and deposited into the member’s financial institution, normally in 2 to 3 business days. Partial payments are limited to the amount of pay and allowances the member has accrued to the date of the payment. Partial payments are recouped in full on the next available payday.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.7.3.<b class="calibre1"> Permanent Change of Station Advance Payments.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Advance payments of pay and allowances provide members with funds to meet extraordinary expenses incident to a government-ordered relocation that are directly related to the permanent change of station and not covered by other entitlements. A permanent change of station advance payment is an advance of up to 3 months of basic pay, less the mandatory deductions of FICA, FITW, SITW, Air Force Retirement Home, and all known debts currently being deducted. Airman First Class and below must have the approval of their immediate commander for advance pay. If the desired repayment period is greater than 12 months or the amount requested is greater than 1 month’s basic pay, then all members must have the approval of their immediate commander. Repayment periods greater than 12 months are only approved in cases of financial hardship. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b> Individual billed account government travel charge card usage is authorized and highly encouraged for all permanent change of station related expenses.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.8. Permanent Change of Station Allowances:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.8.1.<b class="calibre1"> Transportation Allowance.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">When military members are ordered to perform a permanent change of station, they may receive a variety of travel allowances. Some of these allowances include:</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.8.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> Government-Procured Transportation. </b>Available United States-certificated air carriers must be used for all commercial air transportation of persons/property when the government funds the air travel. When the authorizing/order-issuing official determines United States-certificated air carriers are unavailable, commercial air transportation on a non-United States-certificated air carrier may be authorized/approved. Documentation explaining why United States-certificated air carrier service is not available must be provided to the traveler. Endorsements on the travel orders or government travel procurement document made in accordance with service guidance are acceptable. Travel time for travel by government conveyance (except government automobile) or common carriers obtained by government-procured transportation is allowed for the actual time needed to travel over the direct route including necessary delays for the transportation mode used.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.8.1.2.<b class="calibre1"> Use of Privately Owned Conveyance. </b>Uniformed service policy is to authorize/approve (as distinguished from permit) privately owned conveyance travel if acceptable to the member and advantageous to the government based on the facts in each case. Other allowable travel and transportation options include government conveyance or commercial carrier. Reimbursement of parking fees, ferry fares, road, bridge and tunnel tolls is authorized for privately owned conveyance over the most direct route between the stations involved. The member is also authorized a flat per diem at the standard continental United States rate for each permanent change of station travel day between authorized points, up to the allowable travel time.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.8.1.3.<b class="calibre1"> Personally Procured Transportation. </b>Department of Defense policy mandates the use of the commercial travel office for all official transportation requirements. A member who, despite the Department of Defense policy, procures common carrier transportation at personal expense for official travel is authorized reimbursement (except transoceanic travel in which no reimbursement is authorized) up to the amount authorized. However, reimbursement must not exceed the cost for the authorized transportation and accommodations over a usually traveled direct route according to a schedule necessary to meet the requirements of the order. Commands/units are expected to take appropriate disciplinary action when a member and (or) an authorizing/order-issuing official fail to follow the regulations concerning commercial travel office use. Consult the Joint Travel Regulation for additional information.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.8.1.4.<b class="calibre1"> Mixed Modes.</b> When both government-procured and personally procured modes of transportation are used, the Air Force uses a combination of rules governed by the Joint Travel Regulation. The local Financial Service Office can provide specific guidance.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.8.2.<b class="calibre1"> Dependent Travel.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">A military member receives monetary allowance in lieu of transportation and flat rate per diem for the official distance dependents travel with him or her by privately owned vehicle. If dependents purchase commercial common carrier transportation, the member may be reimbursed for the actual cost of the transportation, not to exceed the cost the government would have incurred for ordered travel, and the member receives a per diem allowance for dependents. When the Air Force restricts travel of dependents to a location overseas, dependents may move at government expense to any place (called the Designated Location, which must be approved and listed on the permanent change of station authorization) within the continental United States the member designates. With special approval, dependents may move outside the continental United States.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.8.3.<b class="calibre1"> Dislocation Allowance</b><span class="text_1">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_6">This allowance is paid at a rate determined by the Secretary of Defense and payable to all members with dependents when dependents relocate their household goods in conjunction with a permanent change of station. It is also payable to members without dependents if they are not assigned permanent government quarters upon arrival at the new permanent duty station.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.8.4.<b class="calibre1"> Temporary Lodging Expense and Temporary Lodging Allowance.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">A member arriving or departing permanent change of station at a location within the continental United States may receive temporary lodging expense<b class="calibre1"> </b>to help defray the added living expenses incurred while occupying temporary lodging. A member arriving or departing permanent change of station at a location outside the continental United States may receive temporary lodging allowance<b class="calibre1"> </b>to help defray the added living expenses incurred while occupying temporary lodging. Temporary lodging expense is paid on a travel voucher. Temporary lodging allowance is paid in military pay and is reflected on the leave and earning statement.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.8.5.<b class="calibre1"> Shipment of Household Goods.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">A member ordered on a permanent change of station move may ship household goods<b class="calibre1"> </b>within certain weight limitations at government expense. Authorized weight allowances normally depend on the grade of the member and whether he or she has dependents. A member may be reimbursed for personally arranging for the shipment of household goods. Claims should be prepared and submitted according to service instructions. The government’s cost limit is based on the member’s maximum household goods weight allowance (that is, if the member transports household goods in excess of the authorized weight allowance, all payments are based on the authorized weight allowance).</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.8.6.<b class="calibre1"> Shipment of Unaccompanied Baggage.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">This provision refers to the portion of the permanent change of station weight allowance ordinarily transported separately from the major or bulk of household goods and usually is transported by an expedited mode. When the expedited transportation mode is commercial air, a maximum of 1,000 pounds (net), may be transported.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.8.7.<b class="calibre1"> Shipment of Privately Owned Vehicle.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">When authorized, members may ship one privately owned vehicle at government expense when ordered to go on a permanent change of station to, from, or between locations overseas. Privately owned vehicle storage may be provided or authorized for personally arranging when shipment is prohibited or restricted.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.8.8.<b class="calibre1"> Mobile Home Shipment.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Members who own a mobile home should contact the traffic management office to arrange transportation. In certain circumstances, members may arrange or contract personally for the movement of the mobile home. Shipment of a mobile home is in lieu of household goods transportation.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.9. Temporary Duty Entitlements:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.9.1.<b class="calibre1"> Per Diem.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">This allowance helps defray the cost of quarters, meals, and certain incidentals, Per diem rates depend on the temporary duty location. Travelers are paid a prescribed amount for meals and incidental expenses plus the actual amount for lodging, not to exceed the maximum lodging rate for the specific location. The rates depend on the availability of government facilities, such as quarters and dining facilities.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.9.2.<b class="calibre1"> Transportation</b><span class="text_1">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_6">Policy mandates that uniformed service members use available commercial travel offices to arrange official travel. The mode of transportation used between the points designated in the travel order will determine the transportation entitlement. On the other hand, if the member receives authorization to travel at personal expense, he or she will receive a reimbursement limited to what cost the government would have incurred for the authorized mode of travel. Consult the transportation office or commercial travel office for assistance.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.9.3.<b class="calibre1"> Miscellaneous Reimbursable Expenses.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Reimbursable travel related expenses include travel from home or place of lodging to the servicing transportation terminal by taxi, limousine, bus, or privately owned vehicle; passports, and visas; and rental vehicles when authorized on travel orders.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.9.4.<b class="calibre1"> Temporary Duty Expenses:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">16.9.4.1. When the temporary duty is completed, the traveler is responsible for electronically filing a voucher (Defense Travel System) or preparing his or her DD Form 1351-2, <i class="calibre2">Travel Voucher or Subvoucher</i>,<i class="calibre2"> </i>to claim reimbursement for official travel within 5 business days upon return to permanent duty station. The traveler is responsible for the truth and accuracy of the information. When the traveler signs the form (and this signature authority must never be delegated), he or she attests that the statements are true and complete and that he or she is aware of the liability for filing a false claim. All claims and attached statements shall be completed using ink, typewriter, or computer-generated forms. The member is expected to pay the amount billed from the government travel charge card company upon receipt of the monthly statement.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.9.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Electronic funds transfer is the mandatory means by which a travel claim is settled. The split disbursement option in Defense Travel System, which permits direct payment via electronic funds transfer to the government travel charge card contractor for charges incurred on the individual billed account government travel charge card and to the cardholder for any residual amount will be utilized. Spilt disbursement enables travelers to elect the amount of money to be forwarded to the government travel charge card contractor. In cases where the traveler is temporary duty for 45 days or more, he or she shall file an interim voucher (or have scheduled partial payments setup in Defense Travel System) every 30 days and use split disbursement to pay the bill. An extended temporary duty trip is no excuse for late payment of the government travel charge card bill.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.10. The Government Travel Charge Card Program:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.10.1.<b class="calibre1"> Purpose.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The travel card program is intended to facilitate and standardize the use by Department of Defense travelers of a safe, effective, convenient, commercially available method to pay for expenses incident to official travel, including local travel. The travel card is used to improve Department of Defense cash management, reduce Department of Defense and traveler administrative workloads, and facilitate better service to Department of Defense travelers. In addition, because of the refund feature of the travel card program, the program results in cost savings for the Department.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.10.2.<b class="calibre1"> Agency Program Coordinators.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">An agency program coordinator is an individual (uniformed member, employee, contractor, or foreign national) designated in writing by a commander or director as responsible for the management of the travel card program. Agency program coordinators are responsible to manage the travel card program within their hierarchy in accordance with Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation, Volume 9, Chapter 3 and understand policies and procedures set forth in the Air Force government travel charge card guide, and the Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.10.3.<b class="calibre1"> Card Use.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Unless otherwise exempted, all Department of Defense personnel are required to use the government-sponsored, contractor-issued government travel charge card for all expenses arising from official government travel. These expenses include lodging, transportation expenses, local ground transportation, and rental car expenses authorized on travel orders. The cardholder, while in a travel status, may use the card for nonreimbursable incidental travel expenses such as rental movies, personal telephone calls, exercise fees, and beverages when these charges are not part of a separate room billing or meal and are reasonable.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.10.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Government travel charge cardholders obtain cash, as authorized, through automated teller machines, rather than obtaining cash advances from a Department of Defense disbursing officer.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.10.3.2. Travelers may use the government travel charge card at a specified network of automated teller machine to obtain cash needed to pay for “out-of-pocket” travel-related expenses. The travel card vendor assigns a personal identification number to each cardholder, together with card issuance to permit automated teller machine access. Automated teller machine advances will not be obtained earlier than 3 working days before scheduled travel and are limited to authorized expenses exempt from mandatory card usage (meals, incidentals, miscellaneous expenses, etc.). The travel card vendor will charge the cardholder a transaction fee for automated teller machine use. This includes international transaction fees made as a result of any foreign currency conversion. These charges, which appear on the cardholder’s billing statement, are typically part of the incidental expense portion of per diem and are therefore no longer separate reimbursable expenses. In addition, some banks charge a service fee for automated teller machine access. This fee is also part of the incidental expense portion of per diem and are no longer reimbursable.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.10.4.<b class="calibre1"> Card Abuse</b><span class="text_1">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_6">Commanders or supervisors will not tolerate the misuse of the Department of Defense government travel charge card. Cardholders who misuse their Department of Defense government travel charge card are subject to appropriate administrative or disciplinary action. The cardholder will only use the government travel charge card while in official travel status.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.10.5.<b class="calibre1"> How to Pay the Card Company</b><span class="text_1">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_6">The travel card vendor provides detailed monthly bills. Cardholders are responsible for payment in full of outstanding balances due in the monthly billing statement from the travel card vendor. Payments should be made promptly (within the current billing cycle). Military service members who travel temporary duty and use government credit cards must use the split disbursement feature within Defense Travel System, which automatically pays the credit card vendor for credit card charges while on official travel. Cardholders must designate the total outstanding balance incurred while traveling as split-disbursement when filing their vouchers. A late fee per billing cycle may be assessed for individually billed accounts that are 75 days past the closing date of the account statement on which the charges first appeared.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.10.6.<b class="calibre1"> Travel Card Considerations during a Permanent Change of Station.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Individuals are required to use the government travel charge card during a permanent change of station. Credit limit increases and deferred payment options are available to accommodate the extended travel times of a permanent change of station move. The individual is still responsible for keeping the bill current while in a permanent change of station status. The cardholder must notify the losing agency program coordinator before departing the old duty station and gaining agency program coordinator upon reporting to the new duty station. The losing agency program coordinator will update the travel card account to “mission critical” status and set a future date in the travel card company’s Electronic Access System to deactivate the cardholder’s account based on permanent change of station travel order report no later than date. The agency program coordinator will also submit a transfer request to the travel card vendor so the individual is removed from that unit’s reporting hierarchy level. The gaining agency program coordinator will ensure the transfer request is processed by the travel card vendor when the member arrives so the account information can be updated. The gaining agency program coordinator will also clear the deactivation date within the travel card vendor’s Electronic Access System. </p>
	<p class="block_4">16.10.7.<b class="calibre1"> Delinquencies:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">16.10.7.1. Cardholders are responsible for payment in full of the amount stated on the monthly billing statement. The travel card vendor will submit to Defense Finance and Accounting Service accounts that are 126 days past due for Salary-offset processing. The travel card vendor may also initiate pay garnishment proceedings through the judicial system against cardholder accounts over 126 days delinquent. Upon written request of the travel card vendor, Department of Defense may act on their behalf and collect by payroll deduction from the amount of pay owed to the cardholder any funds the cardholder owes to the travel charge card vendor as a result of delinquencies not disputed by the cardholder on the government travel charge card.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.10.7.2. If the travel card vendor cannot initiate pay garnishment proceedings and the cardholder account is over 210 days delinquent, the travel card vendor will charge off the account and report the delinquency to the credit bureau. The debt will then be collected through a third party collection agency assigned by the travel card vendor.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.10.8.<b class="calibre1"> Collection of Debts:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">16.10.8.1.<b class="calibre1"> Debts to the Federal Government. </b>An Air Force member who owes debts to the federal government or instrumentalities of the government does not have to give his or her consent for the Air Force to collect. Generally, for debts that exceed $100, the individual must be given due process (that is, the individual must receive notification of the pending collection of a debt and be given a chance to repay the debt before any withholding action occurs). However, due process need not be completed before the start of a collection action if an individual’s estimated date of separation is not sufficient to complete collection and the Air Force would be unlikely to collect the debt. Due process may not apply when the collection action can be completed within two monthly pay periods. The Air Force may also collect debts involving any federal agency, portions of a reenlistment bonus not served, delinquent hospital bills for family members, excess shipment of household goods, loss or damage to government property, and erroneous payments made to or on behalf of the member by the Air Force.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.10.8.2.<b class="calibre1"> Waiver and Remission Provisions. </b>Military members may request relief from valid debts by applying for waiver or remission of the debt. The local financial services office has specific guidance and can provide assistance regarding these programs.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.10.8.3.<b class="calibre1"> Waiver of Claims for Erroneous Payments of Pay and Allowances. </b>When a member receives erroneous pay or allowances, he or she may apply for a waiver of claims by the United States. A waiver may be granted when there is no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the member or any other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim. Defense Finance and Accounting Service will rule on all waivers. When filing for a waiver, the collection of the indebtedness must be started.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.10.8.4. <b class="calibre1">Remission.</b> A Regular Air Force or separated member, or his or her commander, may apply for remission of a member’s indebtedness to the United States. The Air Force may not remit or cancel any debt due to non-collection of court-martial forfeiture. In addition to the circumstances creating the debt and the issue of good faith on the part of the member, financial hardship may be a factor for consideration.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.11. The United States Air Force Uniformed Thrift Savings Plan:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.11.1.<b class="calibre1"> Purpose.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The Thrift Savings Plan is a retirement savings and investment plan established for federal employees as part of the Federal Employees’ Retirement Act of 1986. Participation in the plan for uniformed service members is authorized by law. The plan offers Traditional Thrift Saving Plan, tax-deferred advantages similar to those in an individual retirement account or 401(k) plan. Traditional Thrift Saving Plan contributions can be taken out of pay before taxes are computed; as a result, individual tax obligations are reduced. Roth contributions are taken out of your paycheck after your income is taxed. When you withdraw your funds at a future date, your contributions will be tax-free since you already paid taxes on the contributions.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.11.2.<b class="calibre1"> Participating in the Traditional and Roth Thrift Saving Plan.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6"><span class="text_2">A member is authorized to contribute from 1 to 92 percent of their basic pay. Members are not permitted to contribute more than 92 percent of their basic pay so that required deductions of Social Security and Medicare can be made. If a member is contributing to the Thrift Saving Plan from basic pay, the member is also authorized to contribute bonuses, incentive, or special pay.</span><span class="text_3"> </span><span class="text_2">As of January 2017, the maximum Thrift Savings Plan contribution amount for 2017 is $18,000 for deferred and Roth contributions and up to $54,000 total combined deferred/exempt Traditional and Roth contributions. The amounts contributed to the traditional and Roth Thrift Savings Plan must be stated as a whole percent. Members have the ability to manage their Thrift Savings Plan via myPay; those requiring customer assistance for Thrift Savings Plan pay-related questions, leave and earning statement interpretations, and financial issues may contact their financial service office.</span></p>
	<p class="block_4">16.11.3.<b class="calibre1"> Education and Awareness.</b></p>
	<p class="block_8">The Personal Financial Readiness is a core service of the Airman and Family Readiness Center and they offer information, education, and personal financial counseling to help individuals and families maintain financial stability and reach their financial goals.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 16D—Leave Management</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.12. Policy.</p>
	<p class="block_4">As stated in AFI 36-3003, <i class="calibre2">Military Leave Program</i>, lengthy respites from the work environment tend to have a beneficial effect on an individual’s psychological and physical status. Therefore, an effective leave program is an essential military requirement. According to Department of Defense Instruction 1327.6, <i class="calibre2">Leave and Liberty Policy and Procedures</i>, all officers in command, major headquarters, and the military departments shall ensure that secondary and nonessential efforts, though desirable in themselves, do no prevent an effective leave program.</p>
	<p class="block_9"> </p>
	<p class="block_9"> </p>
	<p class="block_3">16.13. Accruing Leave.</p>
	<p class="block_4">The Air Force can pay members for unused leave at certain points in their careers, such as reenlistment, retirement, separation under honorable conditions, or death. By law, members may receive accrued leave payment up to a maximum of 60 days during their military careers. However, the department of Defense policy expresses Congressional concern that members use leave to relax from the pressures of duties and not as a method of compensation. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b> Members do not earn leave when they are absent without official leave, in an unauthorized leave status, in confinement as a result of a court-martial sentence, in an excess leave status, or on appellate leave under Title 10, United States Code, Section 876a, <i class="calibre2">Leave Required to Be Taken Pending Review of Certain Court-Martial Convictions</i>.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.14. Special Leave Accrual.</p>
	<p class="block_4">Special leave accrual earned in combat zones may be kept for 4 fiscal years; special leave accrual earned in support of operations may now be kept for 2 fiscal years. An additional one-time special leave accrual sell-back is authorized for enlisted service members. Under this provision, an enlisted service member may sell back up to 30 days of special leave accrual. Such a sell back counts toward the service member’s cap of 60 days over a career. This provision has no termination date. Members lose any leave in excess of 60 days at the end of the fiscal year unless they are eligible for special leave accrual. Eligible members who lose leave on 1 October may have only that portion of leave restored that could not possibly have been used before the end of the fiscal year not to exceed 120 days. The wing or vice commander has final approval autho<span class="text_4">r</span>ity and may be delegated no lower than the first O-6 in the chain of command. Major command or field operating agency directors of personnel or equivalents (Colonel or above) will approve special leave accrual for their organizations. Any commander in the chain of command may deny a member’s request for special leave accrual without referring the member to a higher-level authority when the request does not meet the criteria for special leave accrual consideration. Members are eligible for special leave accrual if any of the following circumstances exist:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.14.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>A <span class="text_5">m</span><span class="text_6">e</span>mber who serves on active duty while entitled to hostile fire/imminent danger pay for<span class="text_5"> </span>a continuous period of at least 120 days are authorized to retain such<span class="text_4"> </span>leave (not to exceed 1<span class="text_5">2</span>0 days) until the end of the third fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the duty ass<span class="text_6">i</span>gn<span class="text_5">m</span>ent in terminated.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.14.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Members assigned to a non-hostile fire and/or non-imminent danger pay area<span class="text_5"> </span>for a continuous per<span class="text_4">i</span>od of at least 120 days are authorized to retain<span class="text_6"> </span>such leave up to 120 days but n<span class="text_5">o</span>t to ex<span class="text_4">c</span>eed the tot<span class="text_4">a</span>l number of continuous days assigned to the<span class="text_6"> </span>unit or qualifying duty until the end of the second fiscal year in which the <span class="text_4">d</span>uty assign<span class="text_5">m</span>ent is ter<span class="text_5">m</span>inated.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.15. Beginning and Ending Leave.</p>
	<p class="block_4">Leave must begin and end in the local area. The term “local area” means the place of residence from which the member commutes to the duty station on a daily basis. This also applies to leave en route to a permanent change of station or temporary duty assignment. In this case, the local area, as defined at the old and new permanent duty station, applies. The old permanent duty station is for beginning leave; the new permanent duty station is for ending leave. Making a false statement of leave taken may result in punitive action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Regardless of the amount of leave authorized, Finance calculates leave based on the actual date of departure and date of return. General rules on charging leave are as follows:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.15.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Use Air Force Form 988, <i class="calibre2">Leave Request/Authorization</i>, for all types of leave and permissive temporary duty when LeaveWeb cannot be used. (See AFMAN 65-116, Volume 2, <i class="calibre2">Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) Unit Procedures Excluding FSO</i>, Chapter 7, for information concerning LeaveWeb.) (<b class="calibre1">Exception:</b> When members take leave en route with permanent change of station or temporary duty travel, the financial service office uses the travel voucher to determine authorized travel and chargeable leave.) Nonduty days and holidays are chargeable leave days if they occur during an authorized period of leave. If leave includes a weekend, a member cannot end leave on a Friday and begin the leave again on Monday. Further, unit commanders will not approve successive Monday through Friday leaves (or periods of leave surrounding other nonduty days) except under emergency or unusual circumstances as determined by the unit commander.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.15.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>A member who is unable to report to duty upon expiration of leave because of illness or injury must advise the leave approving authority. The next of kin, attending physician, representative at the nearest medical treatment facility, or American Red Cross representative may act on the member’s behalf when the member is incapacitated and unable to provide notification. Upon returning from leave, the member must present a statement from the nearest medical treatment facility or attending physician regarding the member’s medical condition. (<b class="calibre1">Note:</b> The unit commander evaluates the statement before authenticating the leave document.) If a member on leave requires hospitalization or quarters status, leave is not charged while hospitalized or on quarters. Chargeable leave ends the day before and starts again the day following hospitalization or quarter’s status, regardless of the hour of admission or discharge or release from quarters. The unit commander issues an amended leave authorization, if required.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.15.3. The military personnel section and Air Force Personnel Center/DPFCM (Missing Persons Branch) change the member’s leave status to absent without official leave when the member fails to return to duty at the end of his or her leave period.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.16. Extension of Leave.</p>
	<p class="block_4">The member must ask, orally or in writing, for an extension of leave. The extension must be requested sufficiently in advance of expiration of leave authorized to permit the member to return to duty at the proper time if the approval authority disapproves the extension.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.17. Recall from Leave.</p>
	<p class="block_4">Unit commanders may recall members from leave for military necessity or in the best interest of the Air Force. Refer to the joint travel regulation to determine if travel and transportation allowances apply. If the unit commander authorizes the member to resume leave after the member completes the duty that resulted in recall, a new Air Force Form 988 or orders must be prepared.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.18. Types of Leave.</p>
	<p class="block_4">AFI 36-3003 outlines many types of leave, such as:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.18.1.<b class="calibre1"> Annual Leave.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Another name for “ordinary” leave is annual leave. Normally, members request leave, as accruing (earning), within mission requirements. Members use annual leave to take vacations, attend to parental family needs such as illnesses, celebrate traditional national holiday periods, attend spiritual events or other religious observances, or as terminal leave with retirement or separation from active duty.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.18.2.<b class="calibre1"> Advance</b> <b class="calibre1">Leave.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Advance leave is leave granted based on a reasonable expectation that a member will accrue at least that much leave during the remaining period of active military service. The purpose of advance leave is to enable members to resolve emergencies or urgent personal situations when they have limited or no accrued leave. When a member has taken all the advance leave that represents what he or she will be accruing during the remaining period of active service, unit commanders change member’s leave status from advance to excess leave. The financial service office stops or collects, if applicable, all pay and allowances paid after the member’s leave status changes from advance to excess leave.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.18.3.<b class="calibre1"> Convalescent Leave.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Convalescent leave is an authorized absence normally for the minimal time needed to meet the medical needs for recuperation. Convalescent leave is not chargeable leave. Unit commanders normally approve convalescent leave based on recommendations by either the medical treatment facility authority or physician most familiar with the member’s medical condition. When a member elects civilian medical care at personal expense and an Air Force physician determines the medical procedure as elective by military medical treatment facility authorities, such as cosmetic surgery, the member must use ordinary leave for all absences from duty, including convalescence. When medical authorities determine a medical procedure is necessary, such as childbirth, and the member elects civilian medical care, the commander, upon the recommendation by either the medical treatment facility authority or the attending physician most familiar with the member’s medical condition may grant convalescent leave.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.18.4.<b class="calibre1"> Emergency Leave.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Emergency leave is chargeable leave granted for personal or family emergencies involving the immediate family. Unit commanders approve emergency leave; however, commanders can delegate leave approval to no lower than the first sergeant for enlisted personnel. Normally, verification by the America Red Cross is not necessary. However, when the official granting leave has reason to doubt the validity of an emergency situation, he or she may request assistance from the military service activity nearest the location of the emergency or, when necessary, from the American Red Cross. The initial period of emergency leave is usually for no more than 30 days with possible extensions of an additional 30 days. If the individual needs an extension while on emergency leave, he or she must contact the unit commander or first sergeant for approval. Unit commanders should advise members to apply for a humanitarian or exceptional family member reassignment or hardship discharge if the leave period is more than 60 days. Air Force Personnel Center approves emergency leave if leave requested results in a member having a cumulative negative leave balance of over 30 days. The member may not request emergency leave for reasons such as attending court hearings or the resolution of marital or financial problems; the member may, however, request ordinary leave for these situations. Situations when emergency leave is normally authorized include but are not limited to:</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.18.4.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>To visit a terminally ill person in the immediate family of either the member or the member’s spouse.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.18.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>When there has been a verified death in the member’s immediate family or the spouse’s immediate family.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.18.4.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Because the member or someone in the member’s or spouse’s immediate family has a life-threatening condition due to an accident, illness, or major surgery or is admitted to an Intensive Care Unit due to a major illness or accident.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.18.4.4.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Because the member is affected by a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, tornado, flood, or earthquake, and a severe or unusual hardship would result if the member failed to return home.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.18.5.<b class="calibre1"> En Route Leave.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">En route leave is ordinary leave members use in connection with permanent change of station, including their first change of station upon completion of technical training. Members may request advance leave when they do not have enough accrued leave to use as en route leave. Normally, the losing unit commander approves up to 30 days en route leave with any change of station move if the leave does not interfere with the reporting date to either a port or new assignment. Members who complete basic or technical training may request at least 10 days of leave en route if their first duty station is in the continental United States. They may request at least 14 days if going to an overseas assignment.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.18.6.<b class="calibre1"> Terminal Leave.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Terminal leave is chargeable leave taken in conjunction with retirement or separation from active duty. The member’s last day of leave coincides with the last day of active duty. Normally, a member does not return to duty after terminal leave begins. The amount of leave taken cannot exceed the leave balance at the date of separation. See AFI 36-3003 for guidance.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.18.7.<b class="calibre1"> Excess Leave.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Excess leave is leave members normally use for personal or family emergency situations when members cannot request advance leave. Excess leave is a no-pay status; therefore, entitlement to pay and allowances and leave accrual stops on the member’s first day of excess leave. A member will not receive disability pay, if injured, for time spent on excess leave. The period of excess leave will not count toward the fulfillment of any active duty service commitment.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.18.8.<b class="calibre1"> Environmental and Morale Leave.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Environmental and morale leave is leave authorized at overseas installations where adverse environmental conditions require special arrangements for leave in desirable places at periodic intervals. The environmental and morale leave taken is ordinary leave. Funded environmental and morale leave is charged as ordinary leave, but members are authorized to use Department of Defense-owned or -controlled aircraft; plus, travel time to and from the environmental and morale leave destination is not charged as leave. Unfunded environmental and morale leave is also charged as ordinary leave, but members are authorized space-available air transportation from the duty locations, and travel time to and from the leave destination is charged as leave.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.19. Regular and Special Passes.</p>
	<p class="block_4">A pass period is an authorized absence from duty for a relatively short time and starts from the end of normal work hours on a duty day and ends at the beginning of normal work hours the next duty day. There are no mileage restrictions. However, approval authorities may require members to be able to return to duty within a reasonable time in the event of an operational mission requirement such as a recall, unit alert, or unit emergency.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.19.1.<b class="calibre1"> Regular Pass.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">A regular pass starts after normal work hours on a given day and stops at the beginning of normal work hours the next duty day. This includes nonduty days Saturday, Sunday, and a holiday for up to 3 days total if a member normally works Monday through Friday or up to 4 days for a member who works a nontraditional work schedule, such as a compressed workweek. The combination of nonduty days and a public holiday may not exceed 4 days. Department of Defense or higher management levels may determine that a Monday or Friday is compensatory (comp) time off when a holiday is observed on a Tuesday or Thursday, in which case a regular pass may consist of a weekend, a comp day off, and a public holiday.</p>
	<p class="block_7"> </p>
	<p class="block_7"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">16.19.2.<b class="calibre1"> Special Pass.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Unit commanders may award 3- or 4-day special passes for special occasions or circumstances, such as reenlistment or for some type of special recognition or compensatory time off. They may delegate approval to a level no lower than squadron section commander, deputies, or equivalents. Special passes start after normal work hours on a given day. They stop at the beginning of normal work hours on either the 4th day for a 3-day special pass or the 5<sup class="calibre3">th</sup> day for a 4-day special pass. A 3-day special pass can be Friday through Sunday, Saturday through Monday, or Tuesday through Thursday. A 4-day special pass can be Thursday through Sunday or Saturday through Tuesday or Friday through Monday. This applies to a normal Monday through Friday workweek. Passes may be taken in conjunction with leave without a duty day between the pass and leave period. The member must be physically present in the local area when departing and returning from leave. The pass can be taken before or after leave, but not both.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.20. Permissive Temporary Duty.</p>
	<p class="block_4">Permissive temporary duty is an administrative absence for which funded temporary duty is not appropriate. Commanders may not authorize permissive temporary duty in place of leave or a special pass or in conjunction with special passes. Normally, Air Force Form 988 is used for all types of permissive temporary duties. See AFI 36-3003 for complete information.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.20.1.<b class="calibre1"> Authorized PTDYs.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Types of authorized permissive temporary duties include, but are not limited to:</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.20.1.1. Traveling to or in the vicinity of a new permanent duty station to secure off-base housing before the member out-processes the old permanent duty station. (Generally, members request permissive temporary duty after signing in at the new permanent duty station.)</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.20.1.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Accompanying a dependent patient or military member patient to a designated medical treatment facility not in the local area when the medical authority deems permissive temporary duty essential.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.20.1.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>To attend a Department of Defense sponsored employment assistance seminar under the Transition Assistance Program when the member cannot schedule one locally and when the member will separate or retire within 180 days.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.20.1.4.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Attending national conventions or meetings hosted by service-connected organizations such as the Military Officer Association, Air Force Sergeants Association, or the Noncommissioned Officers Association.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.20.2.<b class="calibre1"> Permissive Temporary Duty Not Authorized.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Members are not authorized permissive temporary duties:</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.20.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>To search for a house in a close proximity permanent change of station move.</p>

	<p class="block_3">16.21. Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.21.1. Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence is in support of the Secretary of Defense utilization of the total force policy. The program applies to creditable deployments and mobilizations underway on, or commencing after, <span class="calibre4">      </span><span class="calibre4">      19 January 2007.</span></p>
	<p class="block_4">16.21.2. The Secretary of Defense has directed establishment of programs to recognize members who are required to mobilize or deploy with a frequency beyond established rotation goals and Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence as a new category of administrative absence.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.21.3. The concept of operations is to establish a yearly rotation goal of a deployment-to-dwell ratio of 1:2. That is, for every 1 year a service member of the active component is deployed, he or she must have 2 years at his or her home station. The yearly mobilization-to-dwell ratio goal for the Reserve Component is 1:5 years. Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence earned under these conditions is considered administrative absence.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.21.4. For the purpose of accruing Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence under this program, the Department of the Air Force defines criteria as creditable deployments/temporary to the land areas of Afghanistan or Iraq on or after 19 January 2007, but before 1 October 2011. Aircrew participating in missions into, out of, within or over the area of eligibility in support of military operations, count each day of operation as 1 day of eligibility. Deployment is defined as a member temporary duty under contingency, exercise, and deployment orders to these locations.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.21.5. Creditable time continues to accrue during periods of rest and relaxation, leave, and for temporary duties outside of Afghanistan or Iraq of 30 consecutive days or less.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.21.6. For qualifying deployments and mobilizations beginning on or after 1 October 2011, Active Component Airmen who, on the first day of their current deployment, had deployed in excess of 12 months out of the previous 36 months, and who meet the other eligibility criteria contained in AFI 36-3003, qualify for Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence. </p>
	<p class="block_3">16.22. Program Administration:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.22.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Commanders can only delegate ordinary leave approval to the lowest supervisory level to meet the needs of the unit. Supervisors should train personnel on the requirements of the leave program and ensure they know how to use, LeaveWeb and the Air Force Form 988 to request leave and permissive temporary duty.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.22.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Before approving leave, supervisors should ensure members requesting leave have a sufficient leave balance. Also, they must ensure members provide a valid address and emergency telephone number where they can be reached. Before signing the Air Force Form 988, follow the unit’s procedures to obtain a leave authorization number. Leave numbers normally will not be given earlier than 14 days prior to the leave effective date. Members on leave should use risk management principles to assess all hazards and control risks before excessive or hazardous travel, especially when traveling by automobiles. Also, supervisors should make sure the member has sufficient funds to return to duty on time. If the documentation is not processed digitally, the unit leave monitor sends Part I with authorization number to the servicing finance office and gives Part II to the member after obtaining a leave authorization number. The supervisor retains Part III for completion after the member returns from leave.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.22.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>When the member returns from leave, the supervisor determines how the member’s actual leave dates compared to the first and last days of chargeable leave reported on Air Force Form 988, Part I. The member signs Part III, and the supervisor certifies the dates of leave and sends Part III to the commander support staff for processing. If there is a change in the actual number of days the member took, supervisors will follow the instructions listed in Part III. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b> The Air Force adopted the current method of recording leave to prevent fraud in the leave reporting system.</p>
	<p class="block_5">16.22.4.<b class="calibre1"> </b>LeaveWeb is an Air Force system that automates the method of requesting and processing leave (in lieu of using the hard copy Air Force Form 988). Under LeaveWeb, the member requests ordinary leave which generates an e-mail to his or her supervisor. The supervisor approves or disapproves the leave and, if approved, sends the leave information to the unit leave monitor to validate. Once validated, the leave is sent electronically to finance. The member prints a copy of the approved leave form to hand-carry during leave. Upon returning from leave, the member completes the necessary updates in LeaveWeb and forwards the e-mail to his or her supervisor for endorsement. This electronic process reduces waste in materials as well as man-hours.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 16E—Equal Opportunity</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.23. Equal Opportunity Policy:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.23.1. The Air Force is a richly diverse community consisting of Airmen, military and civilian, with widely varied backgrounds, beliefs, multicultural influences, and many unique life experiences. Airmen are most effective when they are working in an environment that promotes teamwork, inclusion, and mutual respect. Therefore, we must train and prepare our Airmen to view human relation issues and circumstances more broadly. This will allow them to effectively understand, engage, and defeat any potential adversary or personal situation with intelligence and integrity.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.23.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>The Equal Opportunity Program proactively engages all Airmen in the pursuit of equal opportunity. The Air Force Equal Opportunity Program has been developed to foster and support equal opportunity, the Air Force Core Values and Airman’s Creed, and must be carried out in the day-to-day actions of all personnel. The Air Force will not tolerate unlawful discrimination and unlawful harassment or reprisal against individuals who engage in protected activity. Airmen must actively make workplace professionalism a top priority and take proactive steps to prevent, correct and eliminate unlawful discriminatory behavior. Air Force Equal Opportunity policy compliance is a function of leadership.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.24. Equal Opportunity Program Objectives:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.24.1. The primary objective of the program is to eradicate unlawful discrimination. The Equal Opportunity office will assist commanders at all levels in conducting a continuing campaign to eradicate every form of unlawful discrimination or harassment from the workplace. In order to promote a workplace free of unlawful discrimination, to include sexual harassment, the Equal Opportunity office will take proactive steps to ensure all available efforts are in place (for example, human relations education, commander’s calls, climate assessments).</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.24.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>The program also seeks to foster a positive human relations environment. The Equal Opportunity office will use the Human Relations Climate Assessment Subcommittee Installation Equal Opportunity Assessment Summary and Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute Organization Climate Survey tool to evaluate positive and negative factors in the local environment. Human relations education is also provided through proactive measures to ensure all employees and management personnel understand the need for a positive human relations environment.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.25. Unlawful Discrimination:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.25.1. Unlawful discrimination against military members includes any unlawful action that denies Equal Opportunity to persons or groups based on their race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation or sex (including sexual harassment). This type of discrimination can occur in a variety of forms to include: in writing, verbal, or in a combination. Unlawful discrimination can occur on or off base.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.25.2. Unlawful discrimination against Department of Defense civilian employees includes any unlawful employment practice that occurs when an employer fails or refuses to hire or promote, discharges, or otherwise discriminates against any individual with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or limits, segregates, or classifies employees or applicants for employment in any way that deprives or tends to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affects his/her status as an employee because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, (including sexual harassment, pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation age (40 or older), genetic information, physical or mental disability, or reprisal.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.25.3. Unlawful discrimination can also include the use of disparaging terms regarding an individual’s birthplace, ancestry, culture, or the linguistic characteristics common to a specific ethnic group. The use of terms that degrade or connote negative statements pertaining to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, genetic information, and mental or physical disability can constitute unlawful discrimination. These terms include insults, printed material, visual material, signs, symbols, posters, or insignia.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.25.4. The operational language of the Air Force is English. Air Force personnel must maintain sufficient proficiency in English to perform their official/military duties. All official communications must be understood by everyone who has a need to know their content. Commanders may require Air Force personnel to use English only when such use is clearly necessary and proper for the performance of military duties. Accordingly, commanders, supervisors, and managers at all levels must not require the use of English for personal communications unrelated to official duties.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.26. Sexual Harassment:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.26.1. Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that involves unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.26.1.1. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of a person’s job, pay, or career.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.26.1.2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by a person is used as a basis for career or employment decisions affecting this person.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.26.1.3. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.26.2. This definition emphasizes that workplace conduct, to be actionable as an “abusive work environment,” harassment need not result in concrete psychological harm to the victim, but rather need only be so severe or pervasive that a reasonable person would perceive, and the victim does perceive, the work environment as hostile or offensive. Workplace is an expansive term for military members and may include conduct on or off duty, 24 hours a day.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.26.3. Any person in a supervisory or command position who uses or condones any form of sexual behavior to control, influence, or affect the career, pay, or job of a military member or civilian employee is engaging in sexual harassment. Similarly, any military member or civilian employee who makes deliberate or repeated unwelcome verbal comments, gestures, or physical contact of a sexual nature in the workplace is also engaging in sexual harassment.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.27. Military Equal Opportunity Complaint Process:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.27.1. <b class="calibre1">Authorization.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Only military personnel, their family members, and retirees may file military Equal Opportunity complaints. To file a complaint, the individual must be the subject of the alleged unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment. Third parties, to include commanders, supervisors or co-workers, may not file a complaint on behalf of another individual. The Equal Opportunity office will refer all third party individuals who are aware of specific allegations of military Equal Opportunity policy violations to their respective chain of command. The Equal Opportunity office will not accept military complaints from military members, family members or retirees if their concern is related to their off-base or Department of Defense civilian employment.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.27.2. <b class="calibre1">Military Informal Complaint Procedures</b>.</p>
	<p class="block_6">The purpose of the military informal complaint process is to attempt resolution at the lowest possible level.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.27.2.1. To informally resolve unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment complaints, individuals may orally address or prepare written correspondence to the alleged offender, request intervention by a coworker, opt to use the alternate dispute resolution process, or use the chain of command (for example, request assistance from the supervisor, first sergeant, or commander).</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.27.2.2. There is no time limit for filing informal complaints and no requirement for commander approval before accepting informal complaints.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.27.2.3. Informal sexual harassment complaints must be processed in accordance with Title 10, United States Code, Section 1561, <i class="calibre2">Complaints of Sexual Harassment: Investigation by Commanding Officers</i> and complaint allegations must be forwarded to the applicable General Court-Martial Convening Authority. The commander must initiate a Commander Directed Investigation. The Equal Opportunity office will serve as Subject Matter Experts for commanders and organizations conducting sexual harassment investigations. The Commander Directed Investigation process for sexual harassment complaints must be complete within 14 calendar days.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.27.3. <b class="calibre1">Military Formal Complaint Procedures:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">16.27.3.1. The purpose of the military formal complaint process is to enable military members, retirees and their family members to formally present allegations of unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment to the Equal Opportunity office with the goal of attempting resolution through a complaint clarification process.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.27.3.1.1. Complaint clarification is the process of gathering information regarding a formal military complaint or hotline complaint to determine whether a "preponderance of evidence" exists to demonstrate that unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment occurred. The complaint clarification includes interviewing or taking statements from complainants, potential witnesses, alleged offenders and anyone else who may have information relevant to the case. The Equal Opportunity office may use information gathered from other investigations in conjunction with (but not in lieu of) their own clarification process to establish a preponderance of credible evidence.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.27.3.1.2. The clarification results are forwarded to the Staff Judge Advocate for a legal sufficiency review. Once the review is complete, the alleged offender’s commander receives the complaint for final action, if appropriate.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.27.3.1.3. The entire complaint clarification process for unlawful discrimination complaints must be completed within 20 duty days. This includes 9 duty days for the Equal Opportunity office to conduct a clarification, 6 duty days for legal review, and 5 duty days for commander action, if required.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.27.3.1.4. Formal sexual harassment complaints must be processed in accordance with Title 10, United States Code, Section 1561, <i class="calibre2">Complaints of Sexual Harassment: Investigation by Commanding Officers</i>. The complaint clarification process for sexual harassment complaints must be complete within 14 duty days.

	<p class="block_6">16.27.3.2. Military formal complaints must be filed within 60 calendar days of the alleged offense. The installation commander may waive the time limits for good cause based on a memorandum with sufficient justification provided by the complainant and submitted through the Equal Opportunity office.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.28. Civilian Complaint Process. </p>
	<p class="block_4">Only Air Force employees, former employees, and applicants for employment may file civilian Equal Opportunity complaints. An aggrieved person can file a complaint if discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation) national origin, age (40 and older), or disability, or if subjected to sexual harassment or retaliated against for opposing discrimination or for participating in the complaint process. Additionally, an employee can file a complaint under Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, which prohibits genetic information discrimination for any aspect of employment, including hiring, firing, pay, job assignments, promotion, layoff, training, fringe benefits, or any other term or condition of employment. To harass or retaliate against a person because of his or her genetic information is illegal under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.</p>

	<p class="block_9"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">16.28.1. <b class="calibre1">Civilian Informal Complaint Procedures:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">16.28.1.1. The purpose of the civilian informal complaint process is to provide for the prompt, fair and impartial processing and resolution of complaints, consistent with legal obligations under Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1614, <i class="calibre2">Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity</i>. The objective is to seek opportunities to resolve issues at the lowest organizational level at the earliest possible time.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.28.1.2. The Equal Opportunity office will work with management and the staff judge advocate in an attempt to resolve the complainant’s concerns. The Equal Opportunity office must complete the informal complaint process within 30 calendar days of the complaint being filed unless the complainant grants an extension not to exceed 60 additional calendar days.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.28.1.3. If the matter is not resolved to the complainant’s satisfaction before the end of the authorized period, including extensions, the complainant is issued a notice of right to file a formal complaint.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.28.2. <b class="calibre1">Civilian Formal Complaint Procedures: </b></p>
	<p class="block_6">16.28.2.1. A formal complaint must be filed at the installation where the alleged discrimination occurred. In order for the complaint to be processed at the formal stage, the initial contact must be within 45 calendar days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 calendar days of the effective date or when he or she becomes aware of the personnel action. The complaint must describe the actions or practices that form the basis of the complaint that was discussed with the Equal Opportunity office during the informal complaint process.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.28.2.2. The complaint must be filed with the Equal Opportunity director or designee within 15 calendar days of the complainant receiving the notice of right to file a formal complaint.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.28.2.3. The Air Force is required to process civilian formal Equal Opportunity complaints in accordance with Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1614 and Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive 110. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission requires federal agencies to discharge certain responsibilities once a civilian formal Equal Opportunity complaint has been filed.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.28.2.4. The Equal Opportunity office must process all formal complaints expeditiously and make a determination whether to accept, dismiss, or partially dismiss a complaint or portion of a complaint to allow an investigation to be completed within 180 calendar days from the date of filing.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.29. Equal Opportunity and Treatment Incident:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.29.1. An Equal Opportunity and Treatment Incident is an overt, adverse act, occurring on or off base, directed toward an individual, group, or institution which is motivated by or has overtones based on race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation or sex which has the potential to have a negative impact on the installation human relations climate. An Equal Opportunity and Treatment Incident may include subjects other than military members such as retirees and family members.</p>
	<p class="block_5">16.29.2. The Air Force classifies these incidents as minor, serious, or major based on: the number of participants, property damage, physical injury, assault, arson, and/or an act resulting in death. Vandalism (degrading graffiti), hate group activity, discriminatory epithets, signs, symbols, or the use of slurs based on race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation or sex may be classified as an Equal Opportunity and Treatment Incident.</p>

	<p class="block_10"><b class="calibre1">16.30</b><span class="text_1">. </span><b class="calibre1">Legal Office.</b></p>
	<p class="block_4">Legal offices provide legal assistance in connection with personal civil legal matters to support and sustain command effectiveness and readiness. Under Title 10, United States Code, Section 1044, the ability to offer legal assistance and legal services to the eligible categories of personnel is contingent upon the availability of legal staff resources and regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Air Force.</p>
	<p class="block_10"><b class="calibre1">16.31</b><span class="text_1">. </span><b class="calibre1">Personal Legal Readiness.</b></p>
	<p class="block_4">Legal readiness is the state of legal preparation in which Air Force members are ready to deploy, both in their personal and mission capacities. Legal readiness involves the member’s awareness of the personal legal issues that may arise in preparation for or during a deployment and the remedies available to avoid or lessen any adverse effects of those issues. This is usually provided through legal assistance available to Regular Air Force members, reservists, and guardsmen on federal active duty, their dependents, and civilian employees stationed overseas and their families. Personnel tasked for deployment at their bases are briefed on preparing their personal and family legal affairs for deployment. Subject areas include, but are not necessarily limited to, wills; service members Group Life Insurance designations; general and special powers of attorney; medical planning, including advance medical directives (living wills and medical or health care powers of attorney), and designation of anatomical gifts; guardians or in loco parentis powers of attorney to ensure care of minor children; landlord-tenant matters; income exclusions and/or tax return filing extensions applicable to potential deployment locations; property and financial affairs management; protections under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act; protections under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act for reserve personnel deploying; and ensuring important documents are maintained in safe, secure, and reasonably accessible locations.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.32. Complaints of Wrongs under Article 138, Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p>
	<p class="block_4">The Uniform Code of Military Justice, Article 138, is another provision for protecting individuals’ rights. Members of the Armed Forces who believe they have been wronged by their commanding officers may request redress under the provisions of Article 138. AFI 51-904, <i class="calibre2">Complaints of Wrongs under Article 38, Uniform Code of Military Justice</i> implements Article 138. Any member of the armed forces who believes himself wronged by his commanding officer, and who, upon due application to that commanding officer, is refused redress, may complain to any superior commissioned officer, who shall forward the complaint to the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the officer against whom the complaint is made. The officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction shall examine into the complaint and take proper measures for redressing the wrong complained of; and he shall as soon as possible, send to the Secretary concerned a true statement of that complaint, with the proceedings had thereon.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.32.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>A member may use Article 138 when a discretionary act or omission by his or her commander adversely affects the member personally. Examples include acts that violate law or regulation; those that exceed the legitimate authority of the commander; ones that are arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion; or those that clearly apply administrative standards unfairly. However, the Article 138 complaint system will not provide redress for:</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.32.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Submissions related to acts or omissions that were not initiated, carried out, or approved by the member’s commander;<span class="text_7"> </span></p>

Absent unusual circumstances, the member must apply for redress within 90 days of the member’s discovery of the wrong complained of and the complaint should contain all available supporting evidence.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.32.2.1. If the commander who allegedly wronged the member is no longer in command of the member, the member must still submit the initial application for redress to the commander who allegedly wronged the member, regardless of that commander’s current position or duty location, or the member’s current position or duty location.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.32.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>The commander complained of may consider other reliable evidence, in addition to matters submitted by the member.

	<p class="block_3">16.33. Mishap Prevention Program:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.33.1.<b class="calibre1"> Purpose.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The purpose of the Air Force Mishap Prevention Program is to minimize the loss of Air Force resources and protect Air Force people from death, injuries, or occupational illnesses by managing risks on- and off- duty. This program applies to all operations except where otherwise prescribed or specified in Status-of-Forces Agreements. Continuing to meet this goal is critical to our mission effectiveness. The challenge of deployments, technologically advanced combat systems, and changing duty requirements demands strong on-duty mishap prevention programs. Off-duty mishap prevention must also adapt to meet the challenges posed by motor vehicles, sports and recreation, and other off-duty activities. All Air Force personnel have responsibilities in the mishap prevention program as aligned within the Air Force Safety Management System and will utilize sound risk management principles, processes, tools, and techniques to assess and mitigate risk associated with both on- and off-duty activities. The Air Force Safety Management System is a mishap prevention framework mandated by AFI 91-202, <i class="calibre2">The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.</i> The Air Force Safety Management System<span class="calibre4"> conceptualizes the mishap prevention effort in four pillars.  These pillars are: Policy and Leadership, Risk Management, Assurance, and Promotion and Education.</span></p>
	<p class="block_15">Figure 16.1 Air Force Safety Management System</p>
	<p class="block_15">Figure 16.1 Air Force Safety Management System</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.33.1.1. The purpose of the Air Force Safety Management System is to utilize the four pillars, as depicted in Figure 16.1, as a framework for structuring the Air Force mishap prevention programs and activities used to minimize risk and reduce the occurrence and cost of injuries, illnesses, fatalities and property damage. Leadership implements the Air Force Safety Management System by providing guidance and goals, establishing safety responsibility and accountability, applying risk management to all activities, and promoting the Air Force Safety Management System throughout the organization. This implementation of the Air Force Safety Management System prevents mishaps and preserves combat capability. Managing mishap prevention activities requires goal setting, planning, executing, and measuring performance in a Plan Do Check Act continuous improvement process.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.33.1.2. Plan Do Check Act is an iterative four-step management method used for the control and continuous improvement of processes and products. Leaders from the squadron to the headquarters will use the Plan Do Check Act methodology to ensure that continuous improvement is being accomplished.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.34.1.3. The desired end result of the Air Force Safety Management System<span class="calibre4"> framework is mishap prevention.  Mishaps cost money, cost lives, and degrade mission and morale. All mishaps are preventable whether they occur off duty or on duty. Commanders, supervisors, and individuals must ensure a robust safety culture permeates through all activities.     </span></p>
	<p class="block_4">16.33.2.<b class="calibre1"> Mishap Defined.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">An Air Force mishap is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in occupational illnesses or death or injury to Air Force personnel, or damage to Department of Defense property.</p>
	<p class="block_6"><span class="text_11">16.33.2.1. </span><span class="text_12">Class A Mishap. </span><span class="text_11">Direct mishap cost totaling $2,000,000, destruction of a </span><span class="text_8">Department of Defense</span><span class="text_11"> aircraft, or a fatality or permanent total disability.</span></p>
	<p class="block_6">16.33.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Class B Mishap.</b> Direct mishap costs totaling $500,000 or more but less than $2,000,000, a permanent partial disability, or inpatient hospitalization of three or more personnel</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.33.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Class C Mishap.</b> Direct mishap cost totaling $50,000 or more but less than $500,000, or a nonfatal injury or illness that results in one or more days away from work.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.33.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Class D Mishap.</b> Direct mishap cost totaling $20,000 or more but less than $50,000, or a recordable injury or illness not otherwise classified as a Class A, B, or C mishap.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.33.3.<b class="calibre1"> Mishap Prevention Responsibilities.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and individuals will enforce established safety rules and carry out required Air Force Safety Management System responsibilities identified within AFI 91-202. They will enforce rules, criteria, procedures, and safety standards to help eliminate unsafe acts or conditions. An effective mishap prevention program depends on individuals integrating mishap prevention principles at every functional level, and taking personal and collective responsibility for complying with and enforcing applicable safety standards. </p>
	<p class="block_6">16.33.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Safety Office. </b>At the installation level, safety staffs, host and tenant unit, implement mishap prevention programs for all Air Force units as prescribed by AFI 91-202 and applicable host tenant support agreements. The occupational safety staff consists of career safety professionals who are first-term and career Airmen trained in the enlisted safety career field (Air Force Specialty Code 1S0X1), as well as Department of Air Force civilians. With the assistance of the commanders, supervisors, and individuals, the host safety office staff provides oversight of the safety program and provides support and guidance to help eliminate unsafe acts or conditions. When mishaps occur, the safety staff ensures all mishaps are investigated and reported. <b class="calibre1">Note</b>: Air Force safety investigations are for mishap prevention purposes only--not for punitive actions or pecuniary liability.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.33.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> Commanders. </b>Commanders at all levels are responsible for implementing the United States Air Force mishap prevention program in accordance with the framework of the Air Force Safety Management System.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.33.3.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Installation Commanders. </b>Installation<b class="calibre1"> </b>commanders provide safe and healthful workplaces for all installation employees; ensure leadership at all levels is held accountable for enforcing safety and occupational health standards, and chair the installation safety council and/or environment, safety, and occupational health council.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.33.3.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Commanders below installation level. </b>Commanders below installation level implement a safety and health program in their unit, or area of responsibility. Where commanders are not authorized fulltime safety personnel, they will appoint a primary and alternate unit safety representative to assist them in implementing their safety program. They also ensure a proactive mishap prevention program is implemented to include procurement and proper use of personal protective equipment, and worker/facility compliance with applicable standards.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.33.3.3.<b class="calibre1"> Supervisors. </b>Supervisors understand and enforce the safety and health standards that apply to their areas, operations, and operations involving their subordinates. They use risk management techniques to analyze work environments and job tasks for hazards; the job safety analysis will be used as part of this process. They review work processes annually, when new tasks or equipment are added, or when existing tasks change. They develop a work-center-specific Job Safety Training Outline on safety, fire prevention/protection, and health requirements. Supervisors will document and maintain completed training in the work area, and will conduct and document monthly spot inspections of the work areas. They report all mishaps that occur in work areas, off-duty mishaps involving assigned personnel, and related subsequent employee absences to the supporting safety office, and ensure the proper forms are completed if a mishap involves a civilian employee.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.33.3.4.<b class="calibre1"> Individuals. </b>Individuals hold a vital role in preventing mishaps. A failure to intervene when a potential unsafe act is identified is a failure to protect. Every Air Force member is accountable for considering their personal safety and the safety of others when participating in on and off-duty activities. Individuals are responsible for complying with all safety instructions, technical orders, job guides, and operating procedures. They identify and report hazardous conditions that place Air Force personnel or property at risk to supervision and/or using the Air Force Form 457, <i class="calibre2">USAF Hazard Report,</i> when necessary. Individuals will report personal injury, property damage, and any suspected exposure to biological, chemical, or nuclear hazardous materials to their supervisors as soon as practical, but not to exceed 24 hours. Individuals should immediately report to their supervisor a physical or mental condition that they feel could impact safe job performance. Individuals will use personal protection equipment for job tasks as identified by supervision. Apply risk management principles in both on- and off-duty activities to enhance the safety and wellbeing of themselves and other personnel.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.34. Human Factors:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.34.1. <b class="calibre1">Overview.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Human factors is about people in their living and working environments, and how features of individual’s tools, tasks, and working environment influence human performance. The Air Force leverages standardized Department of Defense Human Factors Analysis and Classification System codes to determine errors contributory or causal in Air Force mishaps. Through a systematic root cause(s) analysis, human factors deficiencies can be identified, mitigation strategies can be applied, organizational cultures can be improved, and processes can be established to interrupt chains of events and avoid mishaps. To improve human performance and use Human Factors Analysis and Classification System effectively, we must understand the different hazards that exist and how to properly mitigate risks along potential mishap pathways.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.34.2. <b class="calibre1">Root Cause(s) Analysis.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The Air Force uses four levels to determine the root cause(s) of a mishap when dealing with Human Factors Analysis and Classification System: Organizational Influences, Supervision, Preconditions, and Acts:</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.34.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Organizational Influences</b><span class="text_1"> </span>are factors in a mishap if the communications, actions, omissions, or policies of upper-level management directly or indirectly affect supervisory practices, conditions or actions of the operator(s) and result in a system failure, human error, or an unsafe situation. </p>
	<p class="block_6">16.34.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Supervision.</b> Unsafe supervision can stem from failure to correct known problems, inappropriately planned operations, inadequate supervision, and supervisory violations. </p>
	<p class="block_6">16.34.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Preconditions</b> are factors in a mishap if conditions of the operators/individuals, environmental factors, or personnel factors affect practices, conditions, or actions of individuals and result in human error or an unsafe situation. </p>
	<p class="block_6">16.34.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Acts</b><span class="text_1"> </span>are the active failures or actions committed by the operator which complete the mishap event sequence and fall into two categories: violations and errors. Violations factor into mishaps when <span class="text_8">personnel</span> disregard rules and instructions leading to unsafe acts. </p>
	<p class="block_6">16.34.2.5. Through the four levels of Human Factors Analysis and Classification System, we can not only determine mishap root cause(s) for mishaps that have taken place, but more importantly, we can leverage Human Factors Analysis and Classification System to identify hazards early, mitigate risks on our on- and off-duty activities, and proactively avoid mishaps altogether. </p>
	<p class="block_6">16.34.2.6. Figure 16.2 is a diagram describing the complex factors by which the holes in the “cheese” can align resulting in a mishap. Many mishaps have strong correlations to previous mishaps. If we know what the failures or “holes” are, we can develop controls to minimize the risk of similar mishaps happening in the future.</p>
	<p class="block_10"><b class="calibre1">16.35.</b> <b class="calibre1">Accountability.</b></p>

	<p class="block_16"><b class="calibre1">Figure 16.2. Complex Factors that can Lead to a Mishap.</b> (Adapted from Reason, J (1990). Human Error. Cambridge University Press)</p>
	<p class="block_15"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">We cannot tolerate reckless behavior or unwise decisions. All Airmen must take personal responsibility and be held accountable for their actions. Supervisors will ensure military and civilian personnel understand the implications of poor decisions and the importance of compliance. Commanders will ensure personnel are aware of Air Force instruction requirements and enforce compliance. Violations by military personnel are punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and may also be considered misconduct during line-of-duty determinations. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b> Safety investigations are for mishap prevention purposes only. Commanders may direct an additional investigation and use factual information (time, speed, position, weather, etc.) and information obtained elsewhere (non-privileged witness statements, police reports, etc.) for disciplinary purposes (Letter of Reprimand, Article 15, etc.).</p>
	<p class="block_17">16.35.1. <b class="calibre1">Potential Impact of</b> <b class="calibre1">Not in</b> <b class="calibre1">Line of Duty Determination.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">A member who is injured due to his or her own misconduct stands to lose substantial benefits. If a member dies due to his or her own misconduct, the family stands to lose benefits. Regular pay, disability retirement pay, disability severance pay, veterans’ benefits, and survivor benefit plan payments may be reduced or lost. The Servicemember who is permanently disabled due to injury or illness while not in the line-of-duty faces discharge without benefits or further medical care.</p>
	<p class="block_7"> </p>
	<p class="block_4">16.35.2. <b class="calibre1">How to Protect Yourself and Your Family.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Think before you act. Driving while under the influence is obvious misconduct. You do not have to be intoxicated to be found not in the line-of-duty. Speeding, recklessness, and failure to use personal protective equipment resulting in injury may lead to disciplinary action. Your career, your family’s well-being, and most importantly your life depend on you making wise decisions.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.36. Occupational Safety Program:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.36.1. Supervisors are responsible for training, establishing work methods and job instructions, assigning jobs, and supervising personnel. They are in the best position to identify hazards, assess risks associated with those hazards, and correct unsafe work practices or safety deficiencies that would impede mission success.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.36.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>One of the greatest influences on successful mission accomplishment is a highly trained workforce that recognizes the importance of safety precautions and procedures and adheres to standards incorporating the basic elements of risk management.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.36.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Safety training may be integrated into task performance training or conducted separately. Before any operation begins and any safety training can take place, the supervisor must determine where people may be injured or equipment damaged. A job safety analysis is used to evaluate each work task not governed by a technical order or other definitive guidance and when a new work task or process is introduced into the workplace. If unsafe and unhealthful working conditions exist, eliminate or control them through engineering, administrative controls, or personal protective equipment. Commanders and supervisors must provide personal protective equipment for Air Force military members and civilian employees. The use of personal protective equipment is appropriate only if other controls are not possible or practical.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.36.4.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Supervisors must document safety training.<b class="calibre1"> </b>The method of documentation may include, but is not limited to, the Air Force Form 55, <i class="calibre2">Employee Safety and Health Record</i>, electronic mediums such as Air Force forms/MAF LOG C2/CAS-B/G081 or locally developed products. If the Air Force Form 55 is mandated for use as the training documentation device, the entity that mandated the form usage will prescribe the requirement in writing to include entries that require signatures, e.g., hazard communication, respirator, low powered industrial, lockout/tagout, fall protection, confined spaces, radiation safety, laser safety, etc. <b class="calibre1">Note</b>: Signature of the supervisor or the person who conducted the training; other documents may require the initials of the individual and trainer/supervisor.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.37. Hazard Identification and Reporting:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.37.1. Mishap prevention begins with hazard identification. As a supervisor, a good way to know where to begin identifying hazards is to study historical workplace injury and fatality trends. The installation safety office can offer personalized workplace mishap trending. Injury and illness trends are also released annually by The Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration in conjunction with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2014, the six most common ways workers died on the job are:</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.37.1.1. Transportation mishaps (traffic mishaps), 1,976 fatalities. </p>
	<p class="block_6">16.37.1.2. Falls (one level to another; slips and trips), 819 fatalities.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.37.1.3. Workplace violence (homicides), 771 fatalities.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.37.1.4. Contact with objects (struck by, struck against), 723 fatalities.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.37.1.5. Exposure to harmful substances (chemicals), 385 fatalities.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.37.1.6. Fire (fires, smoke, explosions), 147 fatalities.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.37.2. On and off duty Airmen are not immune to injury, illness, and death. Off duty, the most common way Airmen are injured or die is from vehicle related mishaps. On duty, Airmen experience injuries and death similar to national workplace statistics: falls, vehicle mishaps, and struck by objects. Injuries, illnesses, and fatalities can be eliminated through hazard identification. Hazard identification not only includes understanding how injuries occur, but also understanding and enforcing safety standards. Although not all inclusive, to ensure the safety of all, commanders, supervisors, and Airmen at all levels will:</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.37.2.1. Keep areas around exit doors and passageways free of obstructions. Ensure the exit route leads to a public way.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.37.2.2. Remove from service ladders with broken or missing steps, rungs or cleats, broken side rails, or other defects.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.37.2.3. Frequently check the third and/or grounding prong is secure, especially on items unplugged frequently. Do not cut off the prong, or use an adapter to allow a three-prong plug to fit a two-prong receptacle, since this negates third-wire grounding protection.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.37.2.4. Only use multi-receptacle surge protectors to power computers and related equipment such as lights and or fans. Do not use surge protectors or extension cords with high current items such as coffee makers, refrigerators, microwave ovens, heaters, food preparation equipment, etc.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.37.2.5. Ensure Personal Protective Equipment is worn appropriately and where needed (fall protection gear, eye protection, etc.)</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.37.2.6. Ensure Technical Orders, Air Force Instructions, and other regulations are followed.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.37.2.7. Seek to identify and correct hazards such as missing guards, areas where falls are likely, missing and damaged safety equipment, confined space areas, and falling or loose objects/debris.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.37.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Report hazards to the responsible supervisor or local agency. If the hazard is eliminated on the spot, no further action is required; sharing information with other units or agencies may prevent duplicating hazards and deficiencies elsewhere and is recommended. If the hazard presents imminent danger, the supervisor or individual responsible for that area must take immediate action to correct the situation or apply interim control measures. Report hazards to the safety office that cannot be eliminated immediately using Air Force Form 457, <i class="calibre2">USAF Hazard Report</i>, by telephone, or in person. Reports can be submitted anonymously. The Chief of Safety will determine the appropriate safety, fire, or health discipline to investigate the hazard report. The investigator discusses the hazard report with the member who submitted the report (if known), the responsible supervisor or manager, and other parties involved to validate the hazard and determine the best interim controls and corrective action.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.37.4. Air Force Form 457, <i class="calibre2">USAF Hazard Report,</i> must be readily available to all unit personnel in the work center. The investigator must respond within 10 duty days in writing about the corrective action or plans, and conduct follow-up reviews until the corrective action is completed.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.38. Traffic Safety:</p>
	<p class="block_18">16.38.1. The Air Force Traffic Safety program is aimed at preventing and reducing traffic mishaps using a wide-range of mishap prevention program specifically focusing on driving behaviors and risk management. Off-duty traffic mishaps are the leading cause of Air Force fatalities, with motorcycle mishaps accounting for approximately half of all AF traffic fatalities. This is an alarming fact, considering Air Force motorcycle riders, account for only 9 percent of the Air Force population.</p>
	<p class="block_19"> </p>
	<p class="block_5">16.38.2. Reckless driving behaviors (i.e. driving under the influence, speeding, distracted driving, lack of training) are the leading cause in over 75 percent of all private motor vehicle mishaps. Distracted driving (primarily cell phone usage/text messaging) has increased in recent years and according to the National Safety Council was involved in 26 percent of all 2014 motor vehicle mishaps. Several tools are available to help supervisors in educating Airmen in safe driving practice, including Motorcycle training classes, Motorcycle Unit Safety Tracking Tool, Travel Risk Planning System and several online/classroom traffic safety courses. </p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 16H—Risk Management</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.39. Definition.</p>
	<p class="block_4">Risk management is a decision-making process to systematically evaluate possible courses of action, identify risks and benefits, and determine the best course of action for any given situation. Risk management enables commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and individuals to maximize capabilities while limiting risks through application of a simple, systematic process appropriate for all personnel and functions in both on- and off-duty situations. Appropriate use of risk management increases an organization’s and individual’s ability to safely and effectively accomplish their mission/activity while preserving lives and precious resources.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.39.1.<b class="calibre1"> Risk Management Principles.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">Four principles govern all actions associated with risk management. These principles are the cornerstone of effective risk management and are applicable 24-hours a day, 7-days a week, 365-days a year (24-7-365) by all personnel, for all on- and off-duty operations, tasks and activities.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> Accept No Unnecessary Risk. </b>Unnecessary risk comes without a commensurate return in terms of real benefits or available opportunities and will not contribute meaningfully to mission or activity accomplishment, and needlessly jeopardizes personnel or other assets. All Air Force missions and daily routines involve risk. The most logical choices for accomplishing a mission are those that meet all mission requirements while exposing personnel and resources to the lowest acceptable risk; take only those risks that are necessary to accomplish the mission or task. However, we cannot and should not be completely risk averse; even high risk endeavors may be undertaken when there is a well-founded basis to believe that the sum of the benefits exceeds the sum of the costs. Balancing benefits and costs is a subjective process and tied intimately with the factors affecting the mission or activity; therefore, personnel with prior knowledge and experience of the mission or activity must be engaged whenever possible in making risk decisions to ensure a proper balance is achieved.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.1.2.<b class="calibre1"> Make Risk Decisions at the Appropriate Level. </b>Although anyone can make a risk decision that impacts their personal well-being, some risk acceptance decisions must be made by an appropriate decision-making authority that can effectively allocate resources and implement controls to mitigate or eliminate risks associated with an operation/activity. Making risk decisions at the appropriate level also establishes clear accountability. Leaders and individuals must be aware of how much risk they can accept and when to elevate risk management decisions to a higher level. Those accountable for the success or failure of the mission or activity must be fully engaged in the risk decision process.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.1.3.<b class="calibre1"> Integrate Risk Management into Operations and Planning at All Levels. </b>Integrate risk management into planning at all levels and as early as possible. This provides the greatest opportunity to make well informed risk decisions and implement effective risk controls. To effectively apply risk management, commanders, supervisors, and personnel must dedicate time and resources to integrate risk management principles into planning, operational processes and day-to-day activities. Risk assessments of operations and activities are most successful when they are accomplished in the normal sequence of events (the pre-planning of a mission or activity) by individuals directly involved in the event, and not as a last minute or add-on process. Any amount of pre-planning that can be accomplished, even in a time constrained environment is better than no planning at all.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.1.4.<b class="calibre1"> Apply the process cyclically and continuously. </b>Risk management is a continuous process applied across the full spectrum of military training and operations, base operations functions, and day-to-day activities and events both on and off duty. This cyclic process is used to continuously identify and assess hazards, develop and implement controls, evaluate outcomes, and provide feedback to our Airmen to save lives and preserve combat resources.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.39.2. <b class="calibre1">Risk Management Levels.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">The principles, goals and fundamental concepts of risk management highlight the universal application of risk management concepts both on- and off-duty. There are two primary levels of risk management (<i class="calibre2">Deliberate </i>and<i class="calibre2"> Real-Time</i>) that dictate the level of effort and scope that should normally be undertaken when evaluating risk(s). Figure 16.3 depicts the basic relationship of these levels and how they relate across the strategic (long-term) to tactical (short-term) spectrums. The controls/resources and issues shown below the risk management levels are examples of resources and impacts that might apply across the planning and execution timelines. As the diagram shows, Deliberate and Real-Time risk management are interrelated when making risk management decisions; they are separated only at the point where the planning phase transitions to the execution phase of the mission/activity. A strong, effective risk management process involves careful and deliberative planning coupled with effective, real-time risk management. This full spectrum approach ensures comprehensive risk mitigation and the likelihood of mission/activity success.</p>
	<p class="block_20">16.39.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Deliberate Risk Management. </b>Deliberate risk management refers to pre-mission/activity planning and involves the full formal application of the complete 5-Step risk management process outlined in paragraph 16.39.3. This process can range from an in-depth planning process involving thorough hazard identification, detailed data research, diagram and analysis tools, formal testing, and long-term tracking of the risks associated with an operation, activity or system, down to normal day-to-day operations/activity planning that utilize the same 5-Step risk management process, but require less time and resources to complete. Generally associated with strategic-level planning, in-depth risk management planning is reserved for complex operations/systems, high priority/high visibility situations or circumstances in which hazards are not well understood. In-depth risk management is normally implemented well in advance of the planned system, mission, event, or activity and is normally reserved for more complex and risky efforts (such as large troop/unit movements, airshow planning, system development, tactics and training curricula development, scheduled vacations, organized camping/hiking activities, scheduled home repairs, etc.). As the situation, operation, or activity becomes less complex, familiar and/or closer to execution, deliberate risk management planning becomes simplified and the focus shifts to ensuring near-term hazards and mitigation strategies are considered. Across the spectrum of deliberate risk management, we must always include the experience, expertise, and knowledge of experienced personnel to identify known hazards/risks and strategies to effectively mitigate risks for the specific mission, activity, or task in both on- and off-duty situations. Although pre-planning is always desired for any situation, we must also consider how we deal with risk management once we begin the execution phase of an activity.</p>
	<p class="block_15">Figure 16.3. Relationship of Risk Management Levels</p>
	<p class="block_15">Figure 16.3. Relationship of Risk Management Levels</p>
	<p class="block_21">16.39.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> Real-Time. </b>This level of risk management is always associated with risk management decisions made in “Real-Time” during the “execution” or tactical phase of training, operations, emergency/crisis response situations, or off-duty activities where there is normally little or no time to conduct formal/deliberate risk management planning. Real-time is usually an informal, mental risk assessment that is done “on the fly” (i.e. short-notice taskings, weather/natural phenomena driven activities, emergency responses, spontaneous off-duty activities, etc.) using basic risk management process steps to identify and mitigate hazards in the new or changing situation. As time is normally constrained or limited in these situations, deliberate risk management planning is impractical. Imperative to the Real-Time situations, is that individuals are able to efficiently and effectively apply risk management concepts to mitigate risks. To enhance recall of critical risk management steps, the Air Force has adopted an easy to remember mnemonic (ABCD discussed in paragraph 16.39.4.) to assist personnel in making sound risk management decisions during “Real-Time” and to provide a description of the Air Force real-time risk management process that is appropriate during the “execution” of a mission or activity and/or time-constrained situations.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.39.3. <b class="calibre1">5-Step Risk Management Process.</b></p>
	<p class="block_6"><span class="text_3"></span><span class="text_2">Risk Management is a continuous, systematic decision informing process consisting of five primary steps (Figure 16.4) that define the formal risk management process primarily associated with deliberative risk management planning and forms the basis for real-time risk management process considerations. The following is a brief description of the 5-Step risk management process:</span></p>
	<p class="block_22">Figure 16.4. 5-Step Risk Management Process.</p>
	<p class="block_22">Figure 16.4. 5-Step Risk Management Process.</p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="text_13"> </span><span class="text_14">16.39.3.1. </span><span class="text_15">(Step 1) Identify the Hazards.</span><span class="text_14"> Step one of the risk management process involves application of appropriate hazard identification techniques in order to identify hazards associated with the operation or activity. Hazards can be defined as any real or potential condition that can cause mission degradation, injury, illness, death to personnel or damage to or loss of equipment/property. Key aspects of this step include:</span></p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.1.1. Mission/Task Analysis: Review current and planned operations and/or tasks associated with the mission or activity.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.1.2. List Hazards: Identify and list hazards and/or factors that may lead to dangers and risks associated with the operation or activity.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.1.3. List Causes: List the causes associated with each identified hazard, and try to identify the root cause(s) against which to apply risk management strategies.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.2. (<b class="calibre1">Step 2) Assess the Hazards. </b>The assessment step involves the application of quantitative and/or qualitative measures to determine the probability and severity of negative effects that may result from exposure to risks/hazards and directly affect mission or activity success. Assessing hazards can be a formalized or intuitive process. Key aspects of this step include:</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.2.1. Assess Hazard Exposure: Evaluate the time, proximity, volume or repetition involved to determine the level of exposure to hazards.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.2.2. Assess Hazard Severity: Determine severity of the hazard in terms of potential impact on personnel, equipment, or mission/activity.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.2.3. Assess Probability: Determine the probability that the hazard will cause a negative event of the severity assessed above. Probability may be determined through estimates or actual numbers (if available).</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.2.4. Assess Risk Levels: Determine the level of risk associated with the hazard as related to Severity and Probability. The level of risk will vary from “extremely high” as associated with frequent exposure and catastrophic effects to “low” as associated with unlikely exposure and negligible effects.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.2.5. Complete Risk Assessment: Combine severity and probability estimates to form a risk assessment for each hazard. By combining the probability of occurrence with severity, a matrix is created where intersecting rows and columns define a Risk Assessment Matrix. Figure 16.5 provides one example of a Risk Assessment Matrix; color coding, coupled with numeric values is one way to ensure the matrix is readable in both color and grayscale formats. Risk Assessment Matrices can take different forms and must be designed to fit the organization or situation as warranted. Note: A complete and in-depth description of the Risk Assessment Matrix can be found in<i class="calibre2"> </i>AFPAM 90-803, <i class="calibre2">Risk Management (RM) Guidelines and Tools</i>.</p>
	<p class="block_23">16.39.3.3. <b class="calibre1">(Step 3) Develop Controls and Make Decisions: </b>Step three involves the development and selection of specific strategies and controls that reduce or eliminate risk. Effective mitigation measures reduce one of the three components (Probability, Severity or Exposure) of risk. Risk mitigation decisions must be made at the appropriate level for the identified risk. The higher the risk, the higher the decision-level needs to be to ensure that an appropriate analysis of overall costs to benefits has been carefully weighed. Keep in mind there is no “cookie-cutter” approach or specific standard for establishing levels of risk management decision authority across the Air Force. Critical is that leadership/decision makers ensure the levels of decision authority are aligned appropriately for mission requirements and experience levels of the personnel conducting operations/activities under their responsibility. Decision levels may vary within a command for differing operations/activities if training requirements, mission sets or activities are divergent enough to warrant separate standards (for example, Air Education and Training Command, Air Force Special Operations Command, etc.). Decision makers must ultimately choose the most mission supportive risk controls, consistent with risk management principles that provide the best solution for the given hazards. Risk decisions must never be delegated to a lower level for convenience or when the situation dictates senior-level involvement; exceptions may be considered in time critical situations where delays might endanger lives, resources or equipment. Key aspects of this step include:</p>
	<p class="block_24">Figure 16.5. Sample Risk Assessment Matrix</p>
	<p class="block_24">Figure 16.5. Sample Risk Assessment Matrix</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.3.1. Identify Control Options: Starting with the highest-risk hazards as assessed in Step 2, identify as many risk control options as possible for all hazards. Each hazard should have one or more controls that can effectively eliminate, avoid, or reduce the risk to an acceptable level.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.3.2. Determine Control Effects: Determine the effect of each control on the risk(s) associated with the hazard. With controls identified, the hazard should be re-assessed taking into consideration the effect the control will have on the severity and or probability. This refined risk assessment determines the residual risk for the hazard (assuming the implementation of selected controls). At this point, consider the cost (personnel, equipment, money, time, etc.) of the control and the possible interaction between controls; do they work together?</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.3.3. Prioritize Risk Controls: For each hazard, prioritize those risk controls that will reduce the risk to an acceptable level. The best controls will be consistent with mission objectives and optimize use of available resources (manpower, material, equipment, funding, time).</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.3.4. Select Risk Controls: For each identified hazard, select those risk controls that will reduce the risk to an acceptable level. As in prioritizing controls, the best controls will be consistent with mission/activity objectives and optimum use of available resources (outlined above).</p>
	<p class="block_25">16.39.3.3.5. Make Risk Control Decision: Analyze the level of risk for the operation/activity with the proposed controls in place. Determine if the benefits of the operation/activity now exceed the level of risk the operation/activity presents. Be sure to consider the cumulative risk of all the identified hazards and the long term consequences of the decision. If the cost of the risk(s) outweighs the benefits, re-examine the control options to see if any new or modified controls are available. If no additional controls are identified, inform the next level in the chain of command that, based on the evaluation, the risk of the mission exceeds the benefits and should be modified. When notified of a situation in which risk outweighs the benefit, the next level in the chain of command must assist and implement required controls, modify/cancel the mission, or accept the identified risks based on a higher level of the risk-benefit equation. Keep in mind that as circumstances change for a given mission/activity, the benefit-to-risk comparison must also be made to ensure that previous “Go/No-Go” decisions are valid.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.4.<b class="calibre1"> (Step 4) Implement Controls. </b>Once control measures have been selected, an implementation strategy must be developed and carried out. The strategy must identify the: who, what, when, where and costs associated with the control measure. For mission-related controls, accountability must be emphasized across all levels of leadership and personnel associated with the action so that there is clear understanding of the risks and responsibilities of commanders and subordinates alike. There must always be accountability for acceptance of risk regardless of circumstances. Key aspects of this step include:</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.4.1. Make Implementation Clear: Provide a roadmap for implementation, a vision of the end state, and describe successful implementation. Deployed the control measure in a method the intended audience can understand.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.4.2. Establish Accountability: Accountability is a critically important area of risk management. The accountable person is the one who makes the decision (approves the control measures), and hence, the right person (appropriate level) must make the decision. Also, be clear on who is responsible at the unit or execution level for implementation of the risk control. Individuals involved in a specific risk management process must be aware of who is responsible and accountable at each stage of an operation/activity and when (if possible) decisions will be elevated to the next level.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.4.3. Provide Support: To be successful, command/leadership must be behind the control measure(s) put in place. Provide the personnel and resources necessary to implement the control measures. Incorporate sustainability from the beginning and be sure to deploy the control measure along with a feedback mechanism that will provide information on whether the control measure is achieving the intended purpose.</p>
	<p class="block_6"><span class="text_8">16.39.3.5.</span><span class="text_10"> (Step 5) Supervise and Evaluate. </span><span class="text_8">Risk management is a process that continues throughout the life cycle of a system, mission, or activity. Leaders and supervisors at every level must fulfill their respective roles to ensure controls are sustained over time</span><span class="text_11">. </span><span id="id_Toc305142018" class="text_11">Key aspects of this step include:</span></p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.5.1. Supervise: Monitor the operation/activity to ensure:</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.5.1.1. The controls are effective and remain in place. </p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.5.1.2. Changes which require further risk management are identified.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.5.1.3. Action is taken when necessary to correct ineffective risk controls and reinitiate the risk management steps in response to new hazards.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.5.1.4. Risk and controls are re-evaluated anytime the personnel, equipment, or mission/activity change or new actions are anticipated in an environment not covered in the initial risk management analysis. </p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.5.1.5. There is continuity of selected risk management controls during leadership changes. Ensuring outgoing leaders share knowledge, experiences, and lessons with incoming leaders provides positive transition of risk acceptance and less volatility to the operation or activity when these changes occur.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.5.2. Evaluate: The risk management process review/evaluation must be systematic. After assets are expended to control risks, a cost benefit review must be accomplished to see if risk and cost are in balance. Significant changes in the system are recognized and appropriate risk management controls are reapplied as necessary to control the risks. Effective review/evaluation will also identify whether actual costs are in line with expectations and how the controls have affected mission performance (good or bad). Other considerations:</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.5.2.1. Every risk analysis will unlikely be perfect the first time. When risk analyses contain errors of omission or commission, it is important that those errors be identified and corrected.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.5.2.2. Measurements are necessary to ensure accurate evaluations of how effectively controls eliminate hazards or reduce risks. When available, After-Action reports, surveys, and in-progress reviews are excellent tools for measurements. To be meaningful, measurements must quantitatively or qualitatively identify reductions of risk, improvements in mission success, or enhancement of capabilities.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.3.5.3. Feedback: A review by itself is not enough; a feedback system must be established to ensure that the corrective or preventative action taken was effective and that any newly discovered hazards identified during the mission/activity are analyzed and corrective action taken. Feedback informs all involved as to how the implementation process is working and whether or not the controls were effective. Feedback can be in the form of briefings, lessons learned, cross-tell reports, benchmarking, database reports, etc. Without this feedback loop, we lack the benefit of knowing if the previous forecasts were accurate, contained errors, or were completely incorrect. Commanders, supervisors and individuals must work with appropriate risk management process managers, Instructors/Advisors to ensure effective risk management feedback and cross tell is collected and distributed to enhance future operations, and activities.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.39.4.<b class="calibre1"> Real-Time Risk Management Process or ABCD</b><span class="text_1"> </span><b class="calibre1">Model.</b></p>
	<p class="block_20">The 5-Step risk management Process is the cornerstone of all risk management decisions and lays the framework for conducting formalized risk assessments normally associated with the deliberative level of risk management. Although real-time risk management is also founded on the 5-Step risk management process, streamlining the steps is essential in situations where risk decisions need to be made quickly and in Real-Time. The real-time risk management process or ABCD model provides individuals with an easy to remember mnemonic that walks them through the essential steps of the RM wheel to: “<span class="text_16">A</span>ssess the situation, <span class="text_16">B</span>alance controls, <span class="text_16">C</span>ommunicate, and <span class="text_16">D</span>ecide and <span class="text_16">D</span>ebrief the risk management decision: <b class="calibre1">ABCD</b>.” This simple and easy to remember memory jogger provides individuals with a means to evaluate risks and formulate mitigation strategies in a short time and can be easily applied in both on- and off-duty situations. Figure 16.6 provides a graphic example of the relationship between the 5-Step risk management Process and real-time risk management process using the ABCD model.</p>
	<p class="block_20"><span class="text_2">16.39.4.1.</span><span class="text_17"> Assess the Situation.</span><span class="text_18"> </span><span class="text_2">Assessing risk in a time-critical environment</span><span class="text_3"> </span><span class="text_2">typically occurs</span><span class="text_3"> </span><span class="text_2">when a planned activity is already underway or when the complexity or perception of overall risk is low. Effective assessment requires the key elements of hazard/risk identification and understanding the negative effects associated with those hazards/risks. Individuals must seriously consider the activity or action in which they are about to engage and choose appropriate mitigation strategies to meet the hazards they identify. In real-time risk management process, a complete assessment of the situation requires three stages of situational awareness in a relatively short time: (a) Perception of what is happening; (b) Integration of information and goals; and (c) Projection into the future. Unlike Deliberate risk management, where there is ample time to assess potential situations, an individual’s ability to discern the situation and apply available resources quickly and effectively that can mean the difference between success or failure. This first step of the real-time risk management process/ABCD model effectively combines the first two steps of the 5-Step risk management Process.</span></p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> Balance Controls. </b>The second step of the real-time risk management process/ABCD model is specifically tied to making risk control decisions (Step 3 of the 5-Step risk management process) to mitigate or eliminate the risks identified in assessing the hazards of the activity. After assessing the situation, personnel must consider all available controls (resources) to facilitate mission or activity success and how to manage them. Controls/resources can vary in scope and availability from situation to situation. The better-prepared individuals are prior to an activity, the more likely they will have more controls/resources available to create multiple redundancies or “blocks” to effectively eliminate or mitigate potential risks in real-time. As an example, this equates to having a good understanding of the situation, being properly trained, wearing correct personal protective equipment, knowing personal limitations, and having a “Wingman” to support their effort. Each of these controls/resources serves as a layer of protection and enhances a decision maker’s ability to balance risk versus reward through proper preparation and understanding of the situation and options. When making these considerations, Airmen must communicate with their team and leadership to ensure all options and resources are effectively utilized in making a sound, yet timely risk decision.</p>
	<p class="block_26">Figure 16.6. The 5-Step Risk Management Process as related to the Real-Time Risk Management Process/ ABCD Model.</p>
	<p class="block_26">Figure 16.6. The 5-Step Risk Management Process as related to the Real-Time Risk Management Process/ ABCD Model.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.4.3.<b class="calibre1"> Communicate. </b>The third step of the real-time risk management process/ABCD model is to communicate. This communication can take various forms such as Real-Time communication with leadership to discuss problems and/or intentions, internal team/crew communication to discuss Real-Time hazards and mitigation options, or an individual internalizing their current situation and taking time to evaluate if they are heading down the right path. This step assumes individuals and/or teams carefully consider options and controls available to them in Real-Time situations, and that they are aware of how perception and communication skills change in unanticipated and changing environments. Perception and communication skills are adversely affected as individuals become increasingly stressed and lose situational awareness. Feeling undo pressure to succeed or to continue with a plan when anticipated conditions require “mid-stream” changes can have similar effects on individuals and/or team members as they try to compensate. In these high stress situations, communication skills diminish as individuals channelize attention and lose awareness of the overall situation; they can experience tunnel vision and be unable to multitask effectively to deal with the changing circumstances. Understanding this, individuals and teams who are thrust into these situations can better prepare, anticipate, and identify if they or others are losing situational awareness and make corrections. This awareness enables individuals to communicate with teammates and leadership in Real-Time situations, and allows them to take a step back and reevaluate options. Asking questions such as: “Who needs to know about the situation?” “Who can help or assist?” “Who can provide back-up?” or “Can this be done differently?” are just a few examples of the considerations that must be made prior to implementing a mitigation strategy in real-time.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.4.4.<b class="calibre1"> Decide and Debrief:</b></p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.4.4.1. The final step of the real-time risk management process/ABCD model is to make the decision to continue, modify or abandon the mission/activity based upon Real-Time circumstances and conditions. Unlike step 4 of the 5-Step risk management process where an implementation strategy is carefully developed and carried out through identification of the who, what, when, where and cost associated with the control prior to an activity, real-time risk management process relies on the individual or small group taking immediate or near immediate action to mitigate risk(s) in real-time. This aspect alone can make real-time risk management process decisions riskier than deliberate risk management decisions. Individuals must realize this and make every effort to deliberately weigh risk decisions before taking action to ensure they are selecting the best course of action.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.39.4.4.2. Sometimes the original plan must be modified or changed to account for unforeseen issues in order to assure success. Although minor changes or modifications to a plan or strategy may be easily implemented, others may require higher authority (if available) to properly weigh the risk and determine the best course of action. Accountability under these circumstances rests solely with the individual(s) involved in the activity and their responsibility is to fully understand the scope and limits of their Go/No-Go decision and act accordingly. As such, the acceptance of risk and associated consequences needs to be taken seriously with the understanding that any adverse outcome from a selected course of action may not only affect the individual, but greatly impact loved ones, co-workers, and ultimately their valuable contribution to the Air Force mission. Although the goal for any mission or activity is to operate safely and achieve success, all Airmen must consider the possibility of abandoning the mission or activity if the situation appears too risky or too costly to continue and there are no reasonable options or strategies to change/alter the circumstances in the time remaining to conduct the mission/activity.</p>
	<p class="block_8">16.39.4.4.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>As with the formal 5-Step risk management process, both leadership and personnel involved in a mission/activity must ensure that the feedback loop or “debrief” aspect of the “D<i class="calibre2">” </i>is performed. This vital process step ensures individuals follow through and complete the ABCD<i class="calibre2"> </i>mnemonic loop by identifying what worked, what did not work, and ensures documented lessons learned are disseminated. Debriefs will improve performance, mitigate risks in future activities, and are essential in completing the ABCD<i class="calibre2"> </i>loop. Asking questions such as: “Was our assessment accurate?” “Were we lucky?” “How well did we use the controls/resources?” “Was the communication effective?” and “What can we do to improve the events in the future?” are a few examples of questions that leaders, crews/teams, and individuals can ask in debriefs to ensure future activities are improved and risks are reduced.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 16I—Sexual Assault</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.40. Air Force Policies and Procedures for Prevention of and Response to Sexual Assault:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.40.1. Sexual Assault Is a Crime.</p>
	<p class="block_6">The United States Air Force does not tolerate sexual assault. Sexual assault is criminal conduct that falls well short of the standards America expects of the men and women in uniform and violates Air Force Core Values. Inherent in the Air Force Core Values of Integrity First, Service Before Self and Excellence in All We Do, is respect: self-respect, mutual respect, and respect for the Air Force as an institution.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.40.2. Sexual Assault.</p>
	<p class="block_6">The following definition of sexual assault has been directed by the Department of Defense and is for education and training purposes only. This definition does not affect in any way the definition of any offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Commanders are encouraged to consult with their staff judge advocate for complete understanding of this definition in relation to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p>
	<p class="block_6"><i class="calibre2">Sexual assault is defined as intentional sexual contact, characterized by the use of force, threats, intimidation, or abuse of authority or when the victim does not or cannot consent. As used in this Instruction, the term includes a broad category of sexual offenses consisting of the following specific Uniform Code of Military Justice<span class="calibre4"> offenses:  rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual contact, abusive sexual contact, forcible sodomy (forced oral or anal sex), or attempts to commit these offenses</span></i><i class="calibre2">. </i></p>
	<p class="block_27">Consent is defined as words or overt acts indicating a freely given agreement to the sexual conduct at issue by a competent person. An expression of lack of consent through words or conduct means there is no consent. Lack of verbal or physical resistance or submission resulting from the accused’s use of force, threat of force, or placing another person in fear does not constitute consent. A current or previous dating relationship or the manner of dress of the person involved with the accused in the sexual conduct at issue shall not constitute consent. There is no consent where the person is sleeping or incapacitated, such as due to age, alcohol or drugs, or mental incapacity.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.41. Installation Sexual Assault Response Coordinator.</p>
	<p class="block_6">The Installation sexual assault response coordinator is an Air Force civilian employee or Air Force officer reporting to the installation Commander, who serves as the commander’s central point of contact at installation level or within a geographic area to ensure appropriate care is coordinated and provided to adult victims of sexual assault, perpetrated by someone other than the victim’s spouse, same sex domestic partner, and/or unmarried intimate partner, and tracks the services provided to a victim from the initial report through final disposition and resolution. The installation sexual assault response coordinator ensures the implementation of the sexual assault prevention and response program, to include sexual assault awareness, prevention and response training. Installation sexual assault response coordinators are trained and credentialed.</p>
	<p id="id_OLE_LINK8" class="block_3">16.42. Victim Advocate:</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.42.1. A victim advocate provides non-clinical crisis intervention, referral, and ongoing non-clinical support to adult sexual assault victims, perpetrated by someone other than the victim’s spouse, same sex domestic partner, and/or unmarried intimate partner. Support will include providing information on available options and resources to victims. The victim advocate, on behalf of the sexual assault victim, provides liaison assistance with other organizations and agencies on victim care matters and reports directly to the sexual assault response coordinator when performing victim advocacy duties. The Air Force has two types of victim advocates: sexual assault prevention and response victim advocates and Volunteer victim advocates. Both will be trained and credentialed.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.42.1.1. The sexual assault prevention and response victim advocate is a fulltime general service civilian employee selected and trained by the sexual assault response coordinator, who provides essential support, liaison services and care to victims.</p>
	<p class="block_6">16.42.1.2. Volunteer victim advocates are military and Department of Defense civilian employee volunteers selected and trained by the sexual assault response coordinator, who provide essential support, liaison services and care to victims. The victim advocate reports directly to the sexual assault response coordinator while carrying out sexual assault advocacy responsibilities.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.43 Reporting Options.</p>
	<p class="block_4">The Air Force is committed to ensuring adult victims are protected, treated with dignity and respect, and provided support, advocacy, and care. To achieve these objectives, the Air Force has two reporting options: Unrestricted and Restricted Reporting. Unrestricted Reporting of sexual assault allegations activate victim services and accountability responses, and are essential to eliminating the crime. However, in some cases Unrestricted Reporting may represent a barrier for victims to access services, when the victim desires no command or Air Force law enforcement involvement. Consequently, the Air Force recognizes a fundamental need to provide a confidential disclosure vehicle via the Restricted Reporting option. Airmen who make a Restricted Report have access to all victim care services, but no investigation will be opened and the chain-of-command will not be notified. Regardless of whether the victim elects restricted or unrestricted reporting, confidentiality of medical information will be maintained.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.44. Special Victims’ Counsel.</p>
	<p class="block_4">In 2013, the Air Force created the first program to provide adult and child victims of sexual assault with legal representation to assist them. Special Victims’ Counsel provide legal assistance services through experienced, licensed, and independent legal counsel from the reporting process, in the investigation, during the prosecution, and through the appellate process.  Sexual Assault Response Coordinators, military criminal investigators, trial counsel and victim witness liaison personnel must inform a sexual assault victim that they have the opportunity to be represented free of charge. A sexual assault victim may request Special Victims’ Legal Counsel representation at any time. Special Victims’ Counsel deliver victim-centered advice and advocacy through comprehensive, independent representation to sexual assault victims worldwide, assist them in obtaining support and recovery resources, and promote greater confidence in the military justice process and the United States Air Force. </p>
	<p class="block_3">16.45. Response to an Allegation of Sexual Assault:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.45.1. Any military member or civilian employee, other than those authorized to receive confidential communications or otherwise exempted by operation of law, regulation, or policy, who receives a report of a sexual assault incident about a subordinate in the individual’s supervisory chain will report the matter to the sexual assault response coordinator, Commander, and Air Force Office of Special Investigations. Failure to comply may result in administrative action or action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Military members or civilian employees who become aware of a sexual assault incident, not involving a subordinate in the supervisory chain, are strongly encouraged, but not required to report the incident to the installation sexual assault response coordinator or encourage the victim to do so.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.45.2. Upon notification, the sexual assault response coordinator will immediately respond or direct a trained and credentialed victim advocate to respond to the victim. When contacted by the sexual assault response coordinator and/or victim advocate, a sexual assault victim may decline any or all sexual assault prevention and response services or request a different advocate, to include gender specific, if one is available. Unless assistance is declined, the sexual assault response coordinator and/or victim advocate will provide the victim accurate information on the sexual assault response process, including the option of unrestricted or restricted reporting, as applicable. The sexual assault response coordinator and/or victim advocate will inform the victim of the availability of healthcare treatment, including the option of a sexual assault forensic examination, and a Special Victims Counsel.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.46. Reporting Option Eligibility:</p>
	<p class="block_12">16.46.1. The following individuals are eligible for both the Unrestricted and Restricted Reporting option within the SAPR Program.</p>
	<p class="block_13">16.46.1.1. Active duty members who were victims of sexual assault perpetrated by an acquaintance or stranger (non-intimate partner), victim’s spouse, same sex domestic partner, and/or unmarried intimate partner.</p>
	<p class="block_13">16.46.1.1.1. Military members, who are on active duty, but who were victims of sexual assault prior to enlistment or commissioning, are eligible to receive sexual assault prevention and response services under either reporting option. Support to an active duty service member is available regardless of when or where the sexual assault took place.</p>
	<p class="block_13">16.46.1.2. Active duty members’ dependents, 18 and older, who are eligible for treatment in the medical healthcare system, at installations in the continental United States and outside of the continental United States, by an acquaintance or stranger (non-intimate partner), victim’s spouse, same sex domestic partner, and/or unmarried intimate partner.</p>
	<p class="block_13">16.46.1.3. Air Force Reserve component members in Title 10 status who are sexually assaulted when performing active service and inactive duty training will be eligible to receive full sexual assault prevention and response support services from a sexual assault response coordinator and/or volunteer victim advocate.</p>
	<p class="block_13">16.46.1.3.1. If reporting a sexual assault that occurred prior to or while not performing active service or inactive training when not in Title 10 status, Air Force Reserve component members will be eligible to receive limited sexual assault prevention and response support services from a sexual assault response coordinator and/or victim advocate. Local laws and regulations apply when the member is in Title 32 status.</p>
	<p class="block_13">16.46.1.4. Air Force civilian employees who are victims of sexual assault regardless of their duty station location.</p>
	<p class="block_13">16.46.1.4.1. Air Force civilian employees who are victims of sexual assault are not eligible for non-emergency medical services or legal services unless the reporting individual is otherwise a beneficiary.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.47. Restricted Reports:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.47.1. The Department of Defense has directed the implementation of confidentiality in the form of a Restricted Reporting option. This enables eligible victims to report allegations of sexual assault to specified personnel, without triggering an investigation. This reporting option is intended to remove barriers to medical care and support while giving the victim additional time and increased control over the release and management of personal information.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.47.2. The Air Force makes every effort to treat victims of sexual assault with dignity and respect, to protect their privacy to the maximum extent of the law, and provide support, advocacy, and care.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.48. Receiving a Restricted Report:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.48.1. Only sexual assault response coordinators, sexual assault prevention and response victim advocates, volunteer victim advocates and Healthcare Personnel may receive restricted reports of sexual assault. While communications with chaplains or other individuals may be entitled to privileged status under the Military Rules of Evidence or other statues and regulations, such communications are not restricted reports. Chaplains and other individuals entitled to privileged communications are not authorized to accept a report of sexual assault; however communication related to the incident is protected. Before such communications can be considered a restricted report, the restricted report must be reported or forwarded to a sexual assault response coordinator for determination of eligibility.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.48.2. If a victim tells Healthcare Personnel that a sexual assault has occurred, the Healthcare Personnel will notify the sexual assault response coordinator in cases of acquaintance or stranger (non-intimate partner) sexual assault. The requirement of AFI 44-102, <i class="calibre2">Community Health Management</i>, to report incidents of sexual assault to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations or other authorities as appropriate is expressly waived for restricted reports.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.48.3. A victim advocate who is contacted by a victim wishing to make a restricted report but who has not been assigned by the sexual assault response coordinator to serve as the victim advocate for that individual will not enter into a discussion of the circumstances but will immediately refer the victim to the sexual assault response coordinator. The victim advocate is not required to report the initial contact to command or law enforcement.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.49. Notification to Command of a Restricted Report.</p>
	<p class="block_4">Within 24 hours of receipt of a restricted report of an alleged acquaintance or stranger (non-intimate partner) sexual assault, the sexual assault response coordinator will notify the installation or host wing commander that a restricted report of an alleged sexual assault has been made and provide only non-identifiable information. Non-identifying information under the restricted reporting option is intended to provide commanders with general environmental information about the number and types of sexual assaults on the installation and is to be used to provide a better understanding of incidents of sexual assault. Neither commanders nor law enforcement may initiate investigations based on information about restricted reports provided by sexual assault response coordinators.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.50. Unrestricted Reports.</p>
	<p class="block_4">Any report of a sexual assault made through normal reporting channels, including the victim’s chain of command, law enforcement, and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations or other criminal investigative service is considered an Unrestricted Report. Any report of sexual assault made through the sexual assault response coordinator, victim advocate, or Healthcare Personnel by an individual who elects an Unrestricted Report and designates so in writing on the Victim Reporting Preference Statement will be forwarded to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. The individual to whom the Unrestricted Report was made will notify the sexual assault response coordinator in cases of acquaintance or stranger (non-intimate partner) sexual assault.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.51. Use of Information:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.51.1. In cases of an unrestricted report of a sexual assault or information concerning a sexual assault is otherwise known, information concerning the victim and the offense will only be provided to governmental entities or persons with an established official need to know. Those who are deemed to have an official need to know in the Air Force routinely include: law enforcement; the commanders and first sergeants of the victim and the alleged assailant; legal personnel; the sexual assault response coordinator and victim advocate; and healthcare providers as required to perform their respective duties. The intent of this restriction is to protect the privacy of the victim.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.51.2. Commanders notified of a sexual assault through an Unrestricted Report must take immediate steps to ensure the victim’s physical safety, emotional security, and medical treatment needs are met and that the Air Force Office of Special Investigations or appropriate criminal investigative agency and sexual assault response coordinator are notified (in cases of spouse, same sex domestic partner, and/or unmarried intimate partner sexual assaults are referred to Air Force Family Advocacy Program). The appropriate commanders should determine whether temporary reassignment or relocation of the victim or alleged assailant is appropriate.</p>
	<p class="block_4"><span class="text_2">16.51.3. In cases where the victim consults the sexual assault response coordinator, prior to disclosure to the chain of command, law enforcement, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, or other criminal investigative service, and the victim does not elect a reporting option,</span><span class="text_3"> </span><span class="text_2">the sexual assault response coordinator is not under any obligation or duty to inform investigators or commanders about the report and will not produce the report or disclose the communications surrounding the report.</span></p>
	<p class="block_3">16.52. Addressing Victim Collateral Misconduct in Sexual Assault Cases:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.52.1. An investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding an alleged sexual assault may produce evidence that the victim engaged in misconduct like underage drinking or other related alcohol offenses, adultery, drug abuse, fraternization, or other violations of instructions, regulations, or orders. According to the Uniformed Code of Military Justice, the <i class="calibre2">Manual for Courts-Martial</i>, and Air Force instructions, commanders are responsible for addressing misconduct in a manner that is consistent and appropriate to the circumstances.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.52.2. Commanders have the authority to determine the appropriate disposition of alleged victim misconduct, to include deferring disciplinary action until after disposition of the sexual assault case. When considering what corrective actions may be appropriate, commanders must balance the objectives of holding members accountable for their own misconduct with the intent to avoid unnecessary additional trauma to sexual assault victims and the goal of encouraging reporting of sexual assaults. The gravity of any collateral misconduct by the victim, and the impact on good order and discipline, should be carefully considered in deciding what, if any, corrective action is appropriate. Commanders should consult with the servicing staff judge advocate prior to taking any action regarding collateral misconduct.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.53. Prevention and Response for the Deployed Environment:</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.53.1. The Air Force will identify trained military sexual assault response coordinators (and/or trained civilian sexual assault response coordinators who volunteer) for Air Expeditionary Force rotational support for global contingency operations consistent with requirements established by the commander of Air Force forces. Normally, each Air Expeditionary Wing will warrant at least one sexual assault response coordinator requirement. For deployments smaller than an Air Expeditionary Force, deployed commanders must provide a sexual assault response capability consistent with Air Force requirements.</p>
	<p class="block_4">16.53.2. Home station unit commanders must ensure Air Force members are trained on both annual sexual assault and response training requirements and pre-deployment prior to any deployment.</p>
	<p class="block_3">16.54. Conclusion.</p>
	<p class="block_4">This chapter discussed some of the aspects of wing support including the Air Force Portal, military pay and allowances, leave management, LeaveWeb, military equal opportunity, legal services, ground safety, risk management, and policies and procedures for prevention of and response to sexual assault. Supervisors need to ensure their Airmen understand the value of applying the knowledge outlined in this chapter.</p>

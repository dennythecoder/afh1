	<p class="block_1">STUDYING EFFECTIVELY</p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 24A—Overview</p>
	<p class="block_3">24.1. Introduction.</p>
	<p class="block_4"><span class="text_">Getting the most out of promotion studies is an individual affair. No method will produce the best results for every Airman. Lack of success may have more to do with poorly developed study skills than intellectual ability. This chapter suggests methods for effective studying, but each Airman must determine which methods and strategies work best for him or her. </span>This chapter covers effective study habits, study strategies, the military knowledge and testing system, and a learning style self-assessment instrument to help Airmen prepare for promotion exams. This information is not testable for promotion.</p>
	<p class="block_5">Section 24B—Effective Study Habits in Eight Easy Steps</p>
	<p class="block_6">24.2. General Information.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Airmen grapple with many issues that may make it difficult to concentrate on studying. To get promoted, you must study for your Promotion Fitness Exam or United States Air Force Supervisory Exam. The key to effective studying is to study smartly. You can begin with these effective study habits.</p>
	<p class="block_8">24.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Approach Studying with the Right Mindset:</b></p>
	<p class="block_9">24.2.1.1. Many people consider studying a necessary task, rather than an enjoyable opportunity to learn, but research indicates that how you approach a task is almost as important as the task itself. Having the right mindset may help you study more effectively.</p>
	<p class="block_9">24.2.1.2. Sometimes you can’t force yourself to have the right mindset. During such times, you should take a study break. If you are distracted by other issues, studying will be an exercise in futility. Come back to it when you’re not focused on something else.</p>
	<p class="block_9">24.2.1.3. How to improve your study mindset:</p>
	<p class="block_9">24.2.1.3.1. Decide to think positively while you study; remind yourself of your skills and abilities.</p>
	<p class="block_9">24.2.1.3.2. Avoid catastrophic thinking. Instead of thinking, “I’ll never have enough time to study for this exam,” think “It may be a little late to start studying, but if I do it now, I can still get most of it done.”</p>
	<p class="block_9">24.2.1.3.3. Avoid absolute thinking. Instead of thinking “I always mess up,” the more objective view is, “I didn’t do very well last time. What can I do to improve?”</p>
	<p class="block_9">24.2.1.3.4. Avoid comparing yourself negatively with others.</p>
	<p class="block_8">24.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> Bring Everything You Need; Nothing You Don’t:</b></p>
	<p class="block_9">24.2.2.1. When you find an ideal place to study, you may bring things you don’t need. For example, it may seem ideal to type notes into a computer to refer to later, but computers are a powerful distraction for many people. So ask yourself if you really need a computer to take notes, or can you make do with the old-fashioned paper and pencil.</p>
	<p class="block_9">24.2.2.2. Don’t forget the things you need to study for promotion (see the Enlisted Promotion Reference and Requirements catalog, <a href="https://www.omsq.af.mil/TE/EPRRC.pdf" class="text_1">https://www.omsq.af.mil/TE/EPRRC.pdf</a>) to ensure you are studying the correct information. Don’t waste time running back and forth to get an important book, paper, or other resource.</p>
	<p class="block_8">24.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Outline and Rewrite Your Notes.</b></p>
	<p class="block_9">Many people find a standard outline format helps them boil information down to its most basic components, and connecting similar concepts makes information easier to remember during an exam. An outline is most effective as a learning tool when you use your own words and structure because everyone connects similar information differently. Failing to outline in your own style and words may result in failure to remember important items.</p>
	<p class="block_8">24.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Use Memory Games (Mnemonic Devices):</b></p>
	<p class="block_9">20.2.4.1. Memory games, such as mnemonic devices, use simple word association to help remember pieces of information. Some people string together words to form an easy-to-remember nonsense sentence. The first letter of each word stands for a piece of the information you’re trying to remember. A common military mnemonic device example is “Be My Little General of the Air Force.” The first letters of the words help you remember the general officer ranks: Brigadier, Major, Lieutenant, and General.</p>
	<p class="block_9">24.2.4.2. The key to such memory devices is the new phrase or sentence you come up with has to be more memorable and easier to remember than the terms or information you’re trying to learn. These don’t work for everyone, so if mnemonics don’t work for you, don’t use them.</p>
	<p class="block_7">24.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Practice, Practice, Practice.</b></p>
	<p class="block_9">The age-old adage “practice makes perfect” is true. You can practice by yourself using practice exams or flash cards (depending on what’s available). If a practice exam isn’t available, you can make one yourself. However, interactive exercises available at <a href="http://pdg.af.mil/" class="text_2">http://pdg.af.mil/</a> may help you retain information from Air Force Handbook 1, <i class="calibre2">Airman</i>. Whatever tools you use, practice can enhance your retention of general military knowledge in the Air Force Handbook 1, <i class="calibre2">Airman</i>.</p>
	<p class="block_7">24.2.6. <b class="calibre1">Make and Stick to a Schedule:</b></p>
	<p class="block_9">20.2.6.1. Many people plan to study when they get around to it or have some spare time. If you schedule study time the same way your duty hours are scheduled, you’ll find studying is less hassle in the long run. Instead of last-minute cramming sessions, scheduling the same amount of study time every day for 3 to 6 months before your promotion test will be easier and enable you to learn more of the material.</p>
	<p class="block_9">20.2.6.2. Some people study every day, others once or twice a week. Frequency isn’t as important as actually studying routinely. Even if you study one day a week for 6 to 8 months, that is better than a massive cram session a few days before the exam.</p>
	<p class="block_7">24.2.7. <b class="calibre1">Build in Breaks and Rewards:</b></p>
	<p class="block_9">20.2.7.1. If you view studying as a chore, it will be natural to avoid it. If, however, you use rewards to help reinforce what you’re doing, you may be pleasantly surprised by an attitude change.</p>
	<p class="block_9">20.2.7.2. Start by breaking study time into manageable components. Studying for 4 hours at a time without a break is unrealistic for most people. Studying for an hour followed by a 5-minute break and a snack may be more sustainable and enjoyable for you. Divide study time into segments that make sense and work for you.</p>
	<p class="block_9">20.2.7.3. When establishing your goals, establish rewards as well. Tell yourself specifically what your reward will be if you reach your goal: Maybe “I will have a special dessert tonight if...,” or “I will buy a new song online if...,” or “I will spend an extra 30 minutes gaming if...” for reaching the established goal. The point is, find a reward that is small but real, and to stick to it. Setting limits on your behavior is a method to teach yourself discipline.</p>
	<p class="block_7">24.2.8. <b class="calibre1">Stay Healthy and Balanced:</b></p>
	<p class="block_9">20.2.8.1. It may seem hard to live a balanced life, but the more balanced your life, the easier every component becomes. If you spend all of your time focused on one thing, your life may become unbalanced. When that happens, everything becomes more difficult.</p>
	<p class="block_10">20.2.8.2. Maintaining a balanced life comes more easily over time, but you can work to improve health and balance by doing what you already know: exercise regularly, eat nutritious food, and get enough sleep. There are no shortcuts to good health.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 24C—Study Strategies</p>
	<p class="block_3">24.3. General Information.</p>
	<p class="block_11">Whether you are studying for a promotion test, specialty knowledge test, or any other test, the following study strategies may help you attain your goals:</p>
	<p class="block_11">24.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Stay Motivated. </b></p>
	<p class="block_12">Studying and learning can take you far in life, yet it can seem so hard to get around to it, and life’s constant distractions don’t help.</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.1.1. <b class="calibre1">Attention.</b> Distractions can affect your motivation to study. If you were totally isolated on a desert island, where there was absolutely nothing to do but study, you’d study every word of your subject until you were completely versed in it because there would be nothing to distract you. Having so many choices means—now more than ever—we need to exert willpower. </p>

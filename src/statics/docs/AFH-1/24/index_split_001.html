24.3.1.2. <b class="calibre1">What Do You Want Out of Life?</b> To stay motivated, you should think about why you are studying. Presumably, studying is connected to what you want out of life, so ask yourself what you will ultimately get out of those things you do to avoid studying. Your life will be what you make of it.</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.1.3. <b class="calibre1">Feed and Develop Your Mind. </b>We live in a world surrounded by entertainment options. However, your mind needs the nutrition of study as well as the relaxation of entertainment. When you study well, you find it has its own subtle pleasures and satisfactions apart from the positive results it can bring into your life.</p>
	<p class="block_11"><a href="https://eis.aetc.af.mil/hq/A6/CSS/Project%20Documents/AFPAM36-2241/References/MSU%20Learning%20Center.doc" class="calibre4"><span class="text_3">24.3.2.</span></a><b class="calibre1"> Use Time Wisely.</b></p>
	<p class="block_12">You might have all the time in the world, but if you don’t use it wisely, it won’t help you to meet your goals. Procrastination is a problem for many students. The following tips may help you deal with this issue:</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Clear Your Schedule. </b>Recognize that your obligations are as important as other people’s needs. Set limits to prevent or minimize interruptions. Give full concentration to your studies without feeling guilty for whatever you’re not doing.</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Get Motivated.</b> Create a distraction-free work area, and commit to staying there for until you meet the day’s study goal. If you get sidetracked, remind yourself how studying will help you achieve your goals.</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Prioritize. </b>Answers to these questions may help you establish a priority list: What must be done first? When is it due? What is worth more in terms of the score? What is worth more in terms of personal, educational or career goals?</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Use a Daily “To Do” List.</b> A “to do” list can help you reach your goals by helping you prioritize your daily tasks. As you complete tasks, check them off your list.</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Break Your Study into Chunks.</b> Estimate how much time you’ll need to complete a task, and don’t try to do it all at one time. Break it down so that it’s achievable without being overwhelming.</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.2.6.<b class="calibre1"> It Doesn’t Have to Be Perfect.</b> Some people are so afraid they won’t perform perfectly that they don’t do anything at all. Make sure you understand your goals. Then evaluate how important your study is and what level of performance is acceptable to you. Then, just do it.</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.2.7.<b class="calibre1"> When You Really Hate It, Do It First.</b> Work on a task you really hate first, while you have more energy. Reward yourself when you complete those items on <span id="id_environment">your daily list.</span></p>
	<p class="block_11">24.3.3.<b class="calibre1"> Study Environment.</b></p>
	<p class="block_12">Once you know when and for how long you will study, commit to a time and place that meets your needs. Make that decision based on whether the environment matches your learning style. See Section 20E of this chapter for information to help you understand your dominant learning style. When establishing a study environment, consider:</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Time of Day.</b> If possible, schedule your most challenging courses and most intense study sessions when you are most alert. Determine if you feel more alert and productive during the morning, midday, or evening, and schedule accordingly.</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> Posture and Mobility.</b> Some people prefer to sit at a table or desk (formal posture); others learn more easily sitting comfortably on a sofa or lying on the floor (informal); others need to move around when they study. Some people can sit and study for long periods of time (high persistence), while others need frequent breaks (low persistence). Recognize your posture and mobility needs when you to plan.</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.3.3.<b class="calibre1"> Sound.</b> Not everyone needs to study in a perfectly quiet environment; if you like sound when you study, try to make it an environment where the kinds of sounds won’t actually be distracters.</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.3.4.<b class="calibre1"> Lighting.</b> Reading ability can be affected by the amount and type of lighting in your study area, and contrast between text and paper color. Be aware that light does make a difference, and choose a study environment that best matches your learning preferences.</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.3.5. <b class="calibre1">Temperature.</b> You may not be able to control the room temperature, but you should be aware of your temperature preferences and dress accordingly.</p>

	<p class="block_12">24.3.4.1. <b class="calibre1">Be a Lifelong Learner.</b> Technological advances have occurred in exponential leaps over the past century, and the only certainty in life is change. Education is the key to preparing you for change. Your most valuable asset and skill is your ability to learn and apply knowledge gained through education.</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.4.2. <b class="calibre1">Setting Goals. </b>Setting goals is a good way to accomplish a particularly difficult task, such as developing study skills. Setting SMART goals will have you studying like a pro in no time. SMART goals are:</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.4.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Specific.</b> Once you identify what you want to work on, narrow that down to a single, specific thing. Working out one problem at a time may make it easier to reach your goal without spreading yourself too thin. “I want to be a better reader” is broad, so a more specific goal would be “I want to improve my reading speed.” Write your specific goal on a piece of paper.</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.4.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Measurable. </b>You won’t know if you met your goal if you cannot measure it in some way. For instance, instead of “I want to improve my reading speed,” a measurable goal would be “I want to improve my reading speed by 10 words per minute.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.4.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Action. </b>This is where you decide how to achieve your goal. Write this part as an explanatory activity. For example, your goal might now be “I want to improve my reading speed by 10 words a minute. I will do this by skimming over words like ‘the’ and ‘an’.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">24.3.4.2.4.<b class="calibre1"> Realistic. </b>Make sure your goals are achievable. “I will improve my reading speed by memorizing every word in the dictionary” is unrealistic for most people. Everyone has limits (time, resources, ability, etc.). Do not ignore limits or you may set unrealistic goals.</p>
	<p class="block_14">24.3.4.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Timeline. </b>Set a suspense date, and make sure it is both specific and realistic for you. “I will meet this goal sometime over the summer” is vague. “I will meet this goal by the first day of <a target="_top" href="http://www.howtodothings.com/education/a1837-how-to-set-goals-to-improve-study-skills.html" class="calibre4">school</a> next fall,” is specific and realistic. Your timeline may be days, months or years, but must be realistic for you and your lifestyle.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Section 24D—Military Knowledge and Testing System (MKTS)</p>
	<p class="block_3">24.4. General Information. </p>
	<p class="block_11">The MKTS chart is critical to the Air Force promotion system. The chart is used to help guide the development of enlisted study guides to support the enlisted promotion system. Enlisted members should use the chart as a study strategy for the preparation of their promotion fitness exam or United States Air Force supervisory exam.</p>
	<p class="block_11">24.4.1. Every 2 years, members from the enlisted board of director’s (CMSAF and major command chiefs) review the information contain within the study guides and rate the importance of the information and level of understanding for each promotion grade from Staff Sergeant to Chief Master Sergeant. The MKTS chart is provided to the subject-matter experts tasked to write the promotion fitness exam and United States Air Force supervisory exam.</p>
	<p class="block_4">24.4.2. The MKTS chart is located at attachment 1 of study guides. The MKTS chart also provides the opportunity to provide each enlisted grade a promotion study guide based on the information contained in the chart. These promotion study guides are available at <a href="http://www.studyguides.af.mil" class="text_2">www.studyguides.af.mil</a> for download to prepare for promotion testing.</p>

	<p class="block_15"><b class="calibre1">24.5.</b><span class="text_4"> </span><b class="calibre1">Adult Learning Style Profile.</b> </p>
	<p class="block_11">Adapted from Learning Style Form, developed by Dr. Ray Barsch; University of Northwestern Ohio Virtual College, Learning Styles Evaluation.</p>
	<p class="block_11">24.5.1. The statements in Figure 24.1 are designed to help an individual determine their learning style (visual, auditory, or tactile/kinesthetic). No learning style is better than any other. However, knowing your preferred learning style and tailoring your study sessions to that style will help you retain more of the material. Follow the directions in Figure 24.1 to begin discovering your preferred learning style.</p>

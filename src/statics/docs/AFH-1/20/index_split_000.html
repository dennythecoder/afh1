	<p class="block_4">Air Force knowledge is important because it provides the framework of information required to understand the basic infrastructure of the Air Force such as weapon systems, vocabulary, and some Air Force heritage. In these few pages, you will find a small sampling of the knowledge you will need to be a successful Airman. I encourage you to study the priceless information contained in these pages as well as other sources such as the Air University (<a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/awc-ldr.htm" class="text_">http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/awc-ldr.htm</a>). Understanding this Air Force knowledge will give you the power to unleash the Airman inside you, live a career of success, and leave a lasting legacy for future generations to follow.</p>

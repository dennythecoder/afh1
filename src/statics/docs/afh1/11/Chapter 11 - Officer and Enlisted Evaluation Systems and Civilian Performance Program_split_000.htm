<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre1">OFFICER AND ENLISTED EVALUATION SYSTEMS AND CIVILIAN
PERFORMANCE PROGRAM </b></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section
11A—Overview </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">11.1. Introduction: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">11.1.1. The officer and enlisted evaluations, and
civilian appraisals deal directly with the Air Force’s most precious
resource—people. Supervisors must help their subordinates understand their
strengths and weaknesses and how their efforts contribute to the mission.
Supervisors must employ the officer and enlisted evaluation systems, and
civilian performance program in everyday situations to help develop their
subordinates. This chapter addresses the importance of correctly using the
officer and enlisted evaluation systems, and civilian performance program, by
identifying responsibilities, outlining the performance feedback process, and
provides additional information as outlined in governing AFIs 36-2406, <i class="calibre2">Officer
and Enlisted Evaluation Systems</i> and 36-1001, <i class="calibre2">Managing the Civilian
Performance Program</i> respectively.<b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">11.1.2. The officer and enlisted evaluation systems, and
civilian performance program provides: </p>

<p class="msonormal6">11.1.2.1. Meaningful feedback to individuals pertaining to
what is expected of them, advice on how well they are meeting expectations, and
advice on how to better meet these expectations. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">11.1.2.2. A reliable, long-term, cumulative record of performance and
potential based on performance. <b class="calibre3"><i class="calibre4">Section 11B—General Considerations
(Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems) </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal8"><b class="calibre1">11.2. Purpose. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">The Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems have
varied purposes. The first is to establish performance standards and
expectations for ratees, meaningful feedback on how well the ratee is meeting
those expectations, and direction on how to better meet those established
standards and expectations. The second is to provide a reliable, long-term,
cumulative record of performance and promotion potential based on that
performance. The third is to provide officer Central Selection Boards, senior
NCO evaluation boards, the Weighted Airman Promotion System, and other
personnel managers’ with sound information to assist in identifying the best
qualified officers and enlisted personnel for promotion, as well as other
personnel management decisions. The fourth is to document in the permanent
record any substantiated allegation of a sex-related offense against an Airman,
regardless of grade, that results in conviction by courts-martial, non-judicial
punishment, or other punitive administrative action.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">11.2.1. To accomplish these purposes, the evaluation
system focuses on performance. How well the individual does his or her job, and
the qualities the individual brings to the job, are of paramount importance to
the Air Force. Performance is most important for successful mission
accomplishment and important for development of skills and leadership abilities
and in determining who will be selected for advancement through assignments,
promotions, and other personnel actions. The evaluation system emphasizes the
importance of performance in several ways--using periodic performance feedback,
as the basis for formal evaluations, and, for officers, through
performance-based promotion recommendations. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">11.2.2. Effective evaluators must have an adequate
understanding of Officer Evaluation System (OES), Enlisted Evaluation System
(EES), or both, depending on who they supervise. OES/EES training was
implemented in May 96 to help supervisors fulfill their evaluation
responsibilities. Unit commanders are responsible for ensuring all firsttime
supervisors receive mandatory OES/EES training (as appropriate for their
position) within 60 days of being appointed as a rater. Additionally, Air Force
members should receive annual recurring OES/EES training. How and when this
training is conducted is at the discretion of the unit commander. To assist
commanders, OES/EES Training Guides are located on the myPers Website. </p>

<p class="msonormal12"><b class="calibre1">11.3. Forms Used: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal13">11.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Performance Evaluation Forms Used (see AFI 36-2406

administrative action in order to reduce the likelihood of repeat offenses will
escape the notice of current, subsequent, or higher level commanders. This

by the Ratee prior to becoming a matter of record. This is the time to review
for typos, spelling, and inaccurate data and bring it to the attention of the
Rater. If the data is administratively accurate and it is just a matter of the
Ratee disagreeing with the content, the Rater is not required to change their
assessment. When the Ratee signs the evaluation, he or she is not concurring
with the content, but rather acknowledging receipt of the completed evaluation
and is certifying that the Ratee has reviewed the evaluation for administrative
errors. If the Ratee disagrees with the content, (comments and/or ratings) the
Ratee may file an appeal IAW AFI 36-2406, after the evaluation becomes a matter
of record. NOTE: An ACA form is not required upon completion of the OPR/EPR.

<p class="msonormal8"><b class="calibre1">11.7. Rater/Ratee Accountability.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal23">Raters ensure Airmen they supervise receive an ACA
to improve performance and contributions to mission accomplishment. To assist
raters in preparing evaluations, all commissioned officers and enlisted members
who are on active duty or in an active status in a Reserve Component, shall
report (in writing) to their rater within 72 hours, any conviction for a
violation of a criminal law of the United States or violations of a criminal
law of any other country— whether or not the member is on active duty or in an
active status at the time of the conduct that provides the basis for the
conviction—to the member’s rater (first-line military supervisor) or summary
courts-martial convening authority. In the case of a member of the individual
ready reserve, standby reserve, or ANG, all commissioned officers and enlisted
members shall report (in writing) to their wing commanders (or equivalent), in
accordance with the requirements below within 30 days. (Note: While the
National Defense Authorization Act provision only extended the mandatory
reporting to E-7s and above, the Secretary of the Air Force has determined that
any member within the United States Air Force must report covered convictions,
therefore, extends the mandate to all grades).  </p>

<p class="msonormal51">11.7.1. <b class="calibre1">When to Document.</b> In deciding whether
to document adverse information on the performance evaluation, evaluators must
consider the vast majority of Airmen serve their entire career with honor and
distinction; therefore, failure to document misconduct which reflects departure
from the core values of the Air Force is a disservice to all Airmen competing
for promotion. Additionally, evaluators must consider items listed below when
assessing performance and potential, and specifically mention them in
evaluations when appropriate.  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">11.7.1.1. Impact of the misconduct on the Air Force mission
(Did the mission suffer in any way? Was unit morale affected?). </p>

<p class="msonormal52">11.7.1.1.1. All commissioned officers, and enlisted
members above the pay grade of E-6 (E-7 and above), who are on active duty or
in an active status in a Reserve Component, shall report in writing any

States—whether or not the member is on active duty or in an active status at
the time of the conduct that provides the basis for the conviction—to the
member’s first-line military supervisor or summary court-martial convening
authority, or in the case of a member of the individual ready reserve, standby
reserve, or ANG to the Air Reserve Personnel Center or Air National Guard
Bureau, whichever is applicable, in accordance with the requirements below.  </p>

<p class="msonormal18">11.7.1.1.2. For purposes of this policy, the term
“conviction” includes a plea or finding of guilty, a plea of <i class="calibre2">nolo contendere

adjudication withheld, deferred prosecution, entry into adult or juvenile
pretrial intervention programs, and any similar disposition of charges.  </p>

municipality, or local subdivision of any such authority, other than motor vehicle
violations that do not involve a court appearance.  </p>

<p class="msonormal18">11.7.1.1.4. Regular Air Force members shall submit
reports within 15 days of the date the conviction is announced, even if
sentence has not been imposed or the member intends to appeal the conviction.
Air Reserve Component members not on active duty but in an active status shall
submit reports at the first drill period after the date the conviction is
announced, or within 30 days of the date the conviction is announced, whichever
is earlier, even if sentence has not been imposed or the member intends to
appeal the conviction. All members who must submit evidence of their
conviction, must maintain evidence of compliance with this requirement.  </p>

requirements above. Each Service shall also establish points of contact to which
Reserve Component members in the individual ready reserve or standby reserve
who may not know the identity or address of their first line military
supervisor or summary court-martial convening authority may provide information
of a conviction covered under this policy.  </p>

<p class="msonormal5">11.7.2. <b class="calibre1">What to Report.</b> Adverse Actions: For the
purpose of this policy, “adverse action” includes:  </p>

<p class="msonormal44">11.7.2.1. Reportable Civilian Offenses. A conviction
of a Federal criminal law; any State, district, commonwealth, or territorial or
equivalent criminal law or ordinance; or any criminal law or ordinance of any
county, parish, municipality, city, township, or local subdivision of any such
authority, and convictions of any foreign criminal law; other than convictions
for motor vehicle violations that do not require a court appearance.
Specifically, convictions required to be reported include the following: 1) any
finding of guilt; 2) any plea of guilty; 3) any plea of no contest or <i class="calibre2">nolo
contendere</i>; 4) any plea of guilty in exchange for a deferred prosecution or
diversion program, and/or; 5) any other similar disposition of civilian
criminal charges.  </p>

<p class="msonormal37">11.7.2.1.1. Any citation or violation of a motor
vehicle offense which ultimately results in a conviction of a lesser included
offense (resulting from the original citation) is not reportable if the lesser
included offense would not have required a court appearance. For example, a
member who is charged with reckless driving (an offense requiring a court
appearance), but is found guilty of speeding (an offense not requiring a court
appearance) has not been convicted of an offense requiring reporting. Commanders
and/or supervisors who have questions regarding whether a particular conviction
triggers the mandated comment should consult with their staff judge advocate.  </p>

<p class="msonormal18">11.7.2.1.2. In the event a commander or military
law-enforcement official receives information that a member of the Air Force,
under the jurisdiction of another military department, has become subject to a
conviction for which a report is required by this section, the commander or
military law-enforcement official receiving such information shall forward it
to the member’s immediate commander. If the member’s immediate commander cannot
be readily identified, the commander or military law-enforcement official
receiving the information shall forward it to the office designated by the
member’s military department identified as required below.  </p>

<p class="msonormal33">11.7.2.1.3. Procedures shall be instituted to ensure
members covered by the law comply with its requirements and the policy as
stated in this instruction. These procedures shall include points of contact
for other military departments to comply with the notification requirements
above. Points of contact shall also be established with the Reserve Component
members in the individual ready reserve or standby reserve who may not know the
identity or address of their first line military supervisor or summary
court-martial convening authority may provide information of a conviction
covered under this policy.  </p>

<p class="msonormal17">11.7.2.2. Complaints of sex-related offenses against
a member, regardless of grade, resulting in conviction by courtmartial,
non-judicial punishment, or punitive administrative action require a mandatory
notation on the member’s next EPR, OPR, or Training Report, and Promotion
Recommendation Form (if not already documented on an evaluation or
court-martial in the officer’s selection record). Sex-related offenses include
violations of Article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (rape, sexual
assault, aggravated sexual contact and abusive sexual contact), Article 125
(forcible sodomy, which is forced oral or anal sex, and bestiality), Article
120a (stalking), Article 120b (rape and sexual assault of a child), Article
120c (other sexual misconduct, which includes indecent viewing/recording/
broadcasting, forcible pandering, and indecent exposure) or attempts to commit
any of those offenses. The effective date of the requirement for notation is 26
Dec 13.  </p>

<p class="msonormal19">11.7.2.3. If a member has been convicted by a
court-martial or if the Senior Rater decides to file any adverse information in
an Airman’s Officer Selection Record or Senior Non-Commissioned Officer
Selection Record, comments relating to the ratee’s behavior are mandatory on
the ratee’s next OPR, EPR or Training Report, and Promotion Recommendation Form
(if not already documented on an evaluation or court-martial in the Officer
Selection Record or Senior Non-Commissioned Officer Selection Record). The
evaluation becomes a referral for the OPR, EPR, and Training Report. Comments
are also required on Airmen who have been convicted of a “reportable civilian
offense” that: 1) is a sexual offense that is the same as, or closely related
to, Uniform Code of Military Justice, Articles 120, 120a, 120b, 120c, 125, or
attempts to commit any of those offenses; 2) carries a possible sentence of
confinement for more than one year, or death; or 3) resulted in a sentence that
included unsuspended confinement. For guidance on interpreting this paragraph
and sub-paragraphs, supervisors and commanders should consult the servicing
staff judge advocate.  </p>

<p class="msonormal19">11.7.2.3.1. A rater is not required to comment on
the conviction in a current report if, during a previous rating period, the
rater already commented on the underlying misconduct that ultimately resulted
in the conviction. For example: In a case where a member is arrested and
charged with Driving Under the Influence by off-base officials who decline to
waive jurisdiction, the member’s commander issues the member an Letter of
Reprimand based on the evidence, and then comments on the Driving Under the
Influence Letter of Reprimand in the ratee’s next evaluation. Then, the
downtown prosecution results in a conviction during a future reporting period.
In such a case, the rater is not required to comment on the Driving Under the
Influence conviction because the underlying misconduct that led to the
conviction was already addressed in a previous evaluation.  </p>

<p class="msonormal54">11.7.3. <b class="calibre1">Extraordinary Cases</b>.
Raters may request a waiver of the mandatory requirement to document civilian
convictions for good cause. The waiver request will route from the rater,
through any required additional rater and the ratee’s commander, to the ratee’s
Senior Rater. The Senior Rater may either deny the waiver request or endorse
the request and forward to the Major Command Commander (or in the case of
reports within Air Force District of Washington, United States Air Force
Academy, or any Direct Reporting Unit or Field Operating Agency reporting to an
activity on the Air </p>

<p class="msonormal55">Staff, to the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, or in
the case of the ANG, to the Director, Air National Guard). The Director, Air
National Guard may delegate this authority to the respective state’s Adjutant
General, or equivalent for </p>

<p class="msonormal56">Territories and the District of Columbia, who will
make determinations after consultation with the Director, Air National Guard, or
the Deputy Director, Air National Guard. Both the nature and the outcome of the
offense for each approved waiver will remain on file with the Director, Air
National Guard. No further delegation is authorized.  </p>

<p class="msonormal15">11.7.3.1. If the Senior Rater denies the waiver
request, the decision regarding the waiver request is final and may not be
appealed or considered further. This does not prevent an individual from
challenging any completed report in any other appropriate forums, e.g.,
Evaluation Reports Appeal Board, Air Force Board for Correction of Military
Records.  </p>

<p class="msonormal15">11.7.3.1.1. When the Senior Rater endorses the
waiver request and forwards it to the final approval authority (Major Command
Commander, Vice Chief of Staff, or Director, Air National Guard), the final
approval authority can either approve the exception, allowing the exclusion of
any comments in the EPR, OPR, Training Report, and Promotion Recommendation
Form, or deny the request, resulting in the mandatory inclusion of comments
regarding the ratee’s criminal behavior.  </p>

<p class="msonormal33">11.7.3.1.2. The final approval authority is
delegable to the Major Command/CV or, in the case of the Air Force/CV, to the
Air Force/CVA; no further delegation beyond a The Adjutant General, or
equivalent, is authorized for the ANG. The decision of the approval authority
is the final decision for such waiver requests and may not be appealed or
considered further. This does not prevent an individual from challenging any
completed report in any other appropriate forums, e.g., Evaluation Reports
Appeal Board, Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records.  </p>

<p class="msonormal33"> 11.7.3.1.3. In order to approve any waiver
requests, the approval authority must issue a written finding that the
mandatory comments for the specific criminal conviction are not in the best
interests of the Air Force and that the inclusion of any such comments would
unduly harm the ratee. Upon final decision, the final approval authority will
forward the waiver documentation to Air Force Personnel Center/DP3SP via email
and Air Force Personnel Center/DP2SSM via email. Written waiver approvals will
be filed in the member’s Master Personnel Records Group for the sole purpose of
documenting the final approval.  </p>

<p class="msonormal23">11.7.4. <b class="calibre1">Comments.</b> In all cases, when comments
are included in performance evaluations, they must be specific, outlining the
event and any corrective action taken. Comments such as “conduct unbecoming…”
or “an error in judgment led to an off-duty incident…” are too vague. Examples
of valid comments are “Master Sergeant Smith drove while intoxicated, for which
he received an Article 15” and “Capt Jones made improper sexually suggestive
and harassing comments to a squadron member, for which he received a letter of
reprimand.”  </p>

<p class="msonormal22">11.7.5. <b class="calibre1">Organizational Climate.</b>
Organizational climate is defined as the way in which members in a unit
perceive and characterize their unit environment. All Airmen are responsible
for creating an organizational climate in which every member is treated with
dignity and respect, and one that does not tolerate unlawful discrimination,
sexual harassment, or sexual assault in any form. NCOs and officers are not
only responsible for creating this environment but are also accountable for it.
NCOs and officers can build a healthy organizational climate by: communicating
clear direction at all levels of supervision; adhering to and enforcing
standards; not tolerating and, when necessary, appropriately responding to any
form of sexual harassment, sexual assault, hazing, unlawful discrimination, or
any other conduct harmful to the good order and discipline of the unit; being
accountable for their actions; and cultivating an environment where teamwork,
unity and cohesiveness are the standard practice.  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">11.7.5.1. All NCO and officer evaluators will assess their
ratee(s) on what the member did to ensure a healthy organizational climate.  </p>

<p class="msonormal21">11.7.5.2. Commanders at every level have an even
greater responsibility to create a healthy climate in their command.
Additionally, they are responsible for ensuring adherence to Sexual Assault
Prevention Program directives. Command climate, just like organizational
climate, is the perception of a unit’s environment by its members. Commanders
are ultimately responsible for the good order and discipline in their unit and
have unique responsibility and authority to ensure good order and discipline.
Therefore, evaluators must take this special responsibility and authority into
consideration when evaluating a commander’s effectiveness in ensuring a healthy
command climate.  </p>

<p class="msonormal57">11.7.6. <b class="calibre1">Equal Opportunity and
Treatment.</b> The expectation is fair and equal treatment of all and
enforcement of the same behavior in subordinates. Evaluators must consider a
member’s commitment to Equal Opportunity and Treatment when evaluating
performance and making a promotion recommendation. The goal is to ensure fair,
accurate, and unbiased evaluations to help ensure the best qualified members
are identified for positions of higher responsibility. Evaluations must reflect
serious or repeated occurrences of discrimination, to include sexual
harassment, as prescribed in AFI 36-2706, <i class="calibre2">Military Equal Opportunity Program</i>.
<b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 11C—Performance Feedback </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal8"><b class="calibre1">11.8. Purpose. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal23">ACA is formal communication between a rater and
ratee to communicate responsibility, accountability, Air Force culture, an
Airman’s critical role in support of the mission, individual readiness, and
performance feedback on expectations regarding duty performance and how well
the ratee is meeting those expectations to include information to assist the
ratee in achieving success. It is intended to increase Airmen interaction and
support at all levels. If done correctly, mentorship will create and sustain a
culture of belonging. The ACA is also intended to provide Airmen an opportunity
to discuss their personal and professional goals. Raters document the session
on the ACA worksheet and use the Performance Feedback in Section VI to assess
or discuss the objectives, standards, behavior, and performance with the ratee.
Providing this information helps an individual contribute to positive
communication, improve performance, and grow professionally. The following
information applies to all military personnel. </p>

<p class="msonormal29"><b class="calibre1">11.9. Responsibilities: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">11.9.1. The ratee will:  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">11.9.1.1. Know when ACA sessions are due.  </p>

<p class="msonormal58">11.9.1.2. If a ratee requests a feedback session, the rater
will provide one within 30 days of receipt of the request, provided 60 days
have passed, since the last feedback session (i.e., Ratee Requested).  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">11.9.1.3. Notify the rater and, if necessary, the rater’s
rater, when required or requested ACA did not take place.  </p>

<p class="msonormal19">11.9.1.4. Complete Section III on their own and
review Section IX (<i class="calibre2">AB thru Technical Sergeant</i>) or VIII (<i class="calibre2">Master
Sergeant thru Chief Master Sergeant</i>) for joint communication. Sign the ACA
and rater’s copy of the ACA notice indicating the date the supervisor conducted
the ACA session.  </p>

<p class="msonormal5">11.9.2. The rater will:  </p>

<p class="msonormal45">11.9.2.1. Conduct ACA sessions as required by this
instruction. In addition, ACA sessions will be conducted at the ratee’s request
or when deemed necessary (provided 60 days have passed since the last ACA
session [i.e., Rater Directed]).  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">11.9.2.2. Prepare for, schedule, and conduct ACA sessions
(avoid conflicts with TDY, leave, etc., when possible), regardless of whether
the rater received an ACA notice.  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">11.9.2.3. Understand Air Force standards and expectations
and consider them when providing ACA to personnel.  </p>

<p class="msonormal50">11.9.2.4. Provide realistic assessments to help the
ratee improve performance and grow professionally and personally. Realistic
assessments include in-depth discussions with the ratee and written comments on
the ACA worksheet, not just marks on the form.  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">11.9.2.5. Provide the original completed and signed ACA
worksheet to the ratee. </p>

<p class="msonormal26">11.9.2.6. Retain a copy of the signed and dated ACA
notice and worksheet. The Midterm ACA is a required, mandatory supporting
document to be routed with the Performance Evaluation (EPR/OPR), however, will
not be made a matter of the official record. In addition, the Rater will retain
a copy of the initial and midterm ACA as this may be needed for any future
appeals.  </p>

<p class="msonormal18">11.9.2.7. The ACA is a communication tool and is not
to be used to discover or document behavior which may result in administrative
or judicial action. NOTE: It is important that behavior representing a
significant deviation from expected standards is recorded in other
administrative forms (i.e. Letter of Reprimand, Letter of Counseling, Letter of
Admonishment, Memorandum for Record, etc.).  </p>

<p class="msonormal59">11.9.2.8. Provide the ratee with the most current Air Force
Benefits Fact Sheet.  </p>

<p class="msonormal5">11.9.3. The rater’s rater will:  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">11.9.3.1. Monitor personnel to ensure raters properly
conduct ACA sessions.  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">11.9.3.2. Conduct ACA sessions when:  </p>

<p class="msonormal60">11.9.3.2.1. A lower-level rater is not available due to
unusual circumstances.  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">11.9.3.2.2. Officially assuming the subordinate rater’s
responsibilities.  </p>

<p class="msonormal5">11.9.4. The unit commander will:  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">11.9.4.1. Administer the ACA program.  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">11.9.4.2. Monitor raters and ratees to ensure ACA sessions
are conducted properly.  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">11.9.4.3. Consider disciplining and removing from
supervisory positions those raters who fail to conduct documented ACA
sessions.  </p>

<p class="msonormal5">11.9.5. The Military Personnel Section will:  </p>

<p class="msonormal15">11.9.5.1. Provide ACA notices to raters and ratees.
ANG does not currently have standardized automated process to create ACA
notices for raters and ratees. ANG Military Personnel Sections may utilize an
alternate form of communication to notify all raters and ratees of ACA
schedules.  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">11.9.5.2. Not be required to maintain repository for ACAs
for personnel assigned to wing.  </p>

<p class="msonormal61">11.9.6. Unit will:  11.9.6.1. At
the unit commander’s request, develop a tracking mechanism to ensure ACAs are
conducted. It is the responsibility of individual raters to maintain copies of
all completed ACAs and all signed ACA notices (or appropriate statements) on
their assigned ratees (Regular Air Force only).  </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><b class="calibre1">11.10. Who Requires an ACA.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">ACAs are mandatory for officers, second lieutenant
through colonel, and all Regular Air Force and Air Reserve Component personnel.
If an individual requests an ACA session, the rater will provide one within 30
days of receipt of the request, provided 60 days have passed since the last ACA
session. Do not prepare an ACA when a ratee is a captive, patient, prisoner,
absent without leave, etc. For student officers receiving AF Forms 475, ACA is
not required, but may be given at the discretion of the commander of the
school. For student enlisted personnel, in approved initial skills training or
advanced skills training courses an ACA is not required, but may be given at
the discretion of the commander of the school. For those performance
evaluations completed on non-rated initial skills training or advanced skills
training course students, academic progress reports, such as the AETC Form 156
Student Training Report, captured in the Technical Training Management System
or an equivalent document utilized by non-AETC institutions of instruction, will
serve in-lieu of the mandatory mid-term ACA. ACAs are <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">not </i></b>required
for Airmen who have Permanent Change of Station to prisoner status in a long
term military confinement facility owned by the Air Force Security Forces
Center.  </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><b class="calibre1">11.11. Guidance for Conducting ACA Sessions.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal23">ACA sessions will be conducted face-to-face.
EXCEPTION: Raters may conduct sessions by telephone only in unusual
circumstances where face-to-face sessions are impractical, such as when the
rater and ratee are geographically separated or the rater and/or ratee is on
extended TDY. When a telephonic session is conducted, the rater forwards the
ACA worksheet to the ratee to complete Section III and review for discussion
Section VII. The finalized form is forwarded to the ratee within 10 calendar
days after the session.  </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><b class="calibre1">11.12. When to Hold Documented ACA Sessions. </b>See Table
11.1. </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><b class="calibre1">11.13. The ACA Notice:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal62">11.13.1. The rater should receive a
computer-generated ACA notice 30 days after supervision begins (identifying
initial or follow-up ACA sessions as required) and again halfway between the
time supervision began and the projected performance report close-out date
(identifying mid-term ACA session requirement). This notice serves to remind
raters that an ACA session is due; however, failure to receive an ACA notice
does not justify failing to hold a required session.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">11.13.2. Since the ratee shares the responsibility
to ensure ACA sessions are conducted, an ACA notice is also sent to the ratee,
through his or her unit, 30 days after sending the notice to the rater (for
officers) or concurrently with the notice sent to the rater (for enlisted).  </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><b class="calibre1">11.14. Which ACA Form to Use:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">11.14.1. For Lieutenant through Colonel, use AF Form 724.  </p>

<p class="msonormal82">11.14.2. For a Master Sergeant thru Chief Master Sergeant,
use AF Form 932.  </p>

<p class="msonormal5">11.14.3. For Technical Sergeant and below, use AF Form
931.  </p>

<p class="msonormal83"><b class="calibre1">11.15. Preparing the ACA Worksheet. </b>The ACA
worksheet should, as thoroughly as possible, outline the issues discussed
during the ACA session; however, it is primarily a guide for conducting the
assessment session, not a transcript. Therefore, omission of an issue from the
form does not, by itself, constitute proof that the issue was not discussed.  </p>

<p class="msonormal5">11.15.1. The ACA worksheet may be handwritten or typed by
the rater providing the assessment<i class="calibre2">. </i> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">11.15.2. Section I, Personal Information, is
self-explanatory. Fill in all required data.  </p>

<p class="msonormal5">11.15.3. Section II, Types of Assessment. In the
appropriate box, indicate whether the assessment is initial, mid-term,
follow-up, ratee requested, or rater directed.  </p>

<p class="msonormal84">11.15.4. Section III, Self-Assessment is completed by the
ratee. This area provides information to the rater on where the ratee assesses
themselves, and assists the rater with information when accomplishing the
overall assessment.  </p>

<p class="msonormal5">11.15.5. Section IV, Airman’s Critical Role in Support of
the Mission. This section is used to convey to the ratee their critical role in
achieving mission success.  </p>

<p class="msonormal33">11.15.5.1. Organizational Climate Assessment. It is
mandatory for raters to include expectations for contributing to a healthy
organizational climate for Airmen up to the grade of Senior Airman. Raters must
also ensure that NCOs and Officers are accountable for creating a healthy
organizational climate. Raters must ensure that every commander knows he/she is
responsible for, and will be held accountable for, ensuring their unit has a
healthy command climate.  </p>

<p class="msonormal85">11.15.6. Section V, Individual Readiness Index.
Documents the Airmen’s readiness status and Air and Space Expeditionary Force
Indicator. Place an “E” in this block if member is an Enabler. Discuss
importance of meeting deployment requirements.  </p>

<p class="msonormal22">11.15.7. Section VI, Performance: Leadership/Primary
Duties/Followership/Training, covers those qualities and skills required of all
personnel. The Performance: Leadership/Primary Duties/Followership/Training has
five sub-sections for Technical Sergeant and below, and eight sub-sections for
Master Sergeant thru Chief Master Sergeant, to select from each performance
factor. The rater places a mark in the appropriate block which indicates the
ratee’s level of performance.  </p>

<p class="msonormal18">11.15.7.1. Since the primary purpose of the initial
ACA session is to establish expectations for the upcoming rating period, a
rater is not expected to have already developed a clear-cut opinion of an
individual’s performance by the time the session is conducted. Therefore,
raters will mark the “Initial” block in Section II, Type of Assessment, and
will leave blocks in Section VI, Performance: Leadership/Primary
Duties/Followership/Training blank, while discussing each area, and the
performance expectations for the rate in each area during the feedback
session.  </p>

<p class="msonormal50">11.15.7.2. For all other ACA types, the rater will
indicate how the ratee is meeting the established expectations by marking one
block under each main heading. These markings translate to an aggregate rating
on the performance evaluation, and provide an indication of how the ratee is
meeting the expectations set forth by the rater while providing the basis for
the ACA session discussion.  </p>

<p class="msonormal23">11.15.8. AF Form 931, Section VII<i class="calibre2">,
Followership/Leadership</i>, documents an Airman’s ability to lead and develop
subordinates and exercise effective followership in mission accomplishment. The
Followership/Leadership section has four sub-sections to select from for each
performance factor. The rater places a mark in the appropriate block which
indicates the ratee’s level of performance.  </p>

<p class="msonormal85">11.15.9. AF Form 931, Section VIII, and AF Form 932,
Section VII, <i class="calibre2">Whole Airman Concept</i>, consider the Airman’s interpersonal
relations that directly influence behavior and values, level of effort to
improve themselves personally and professionally, and their devotion and
enthusiasm. This section has three sub-sections for both Airman Basic thru
Technical Sergeant,<i class="calibre2"> </i>and Master Sergeant thru Chief Master Sergeant<i class="calibre2"> </i>to
select from for each performance factor. The rater places a mark in the

to facilitate open communication between the ratee/rater and may trigger areas
and/or specific items which need to be probed in more depth. These questions
are not intended to be all encompassing. The purpose is to help start the
conversation on the particular item, not make it an interrogation. AF Form 931
items 6 and 7 are designed to receive feedback from the ratee and to set
specific expectations for the ratee’s growth. </p>

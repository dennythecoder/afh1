<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre2">ENFORCING STANDARDS AND LEGAL ISSUES
Section 7A—Overview </b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">7.1. Introduction. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">Air Force commanders at all levels are required to
continuously<i class="calibre3"> </i>evaluate force readiness and organizational economy,
efficiency and effectiveness. The inspection system provides the commander with
a credible, independent assessment process to measure the capabilities of
assigned forces. Supervisors at all levels play an integral part in this
process through continual assessment of personnel, programs and the areas of
responsibilities they supervise. Furthermore, when systematic, programmatic or
procedural weaknesses are suspected, or to further ensure resources are used
effectively and efficiently, Airmen at all levels may visit the Inspector
General to report these areas as well as potential fraud, waste or abuse cases.
This chapter provides information on the Air Force Inspection System, the
Inspector General Complaints Program, and individual standards and punitive
actions. All four areas are necessary to enable the Air Force to fulfill our
national security obligations efficiently and effectively.<b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Section 7B—Air
Force Inspection System</i> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">7.2. Purpose. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">The Inspectors General mission is defined in headquarters
Air Force mission directive 1-20, <i class="calibre3">The Inspector General</i>, and AFPD 90-2, <i class="calibre3">Inspector
General – The Inspection System</i>. The overall purpose of the Air Force
inspection system is to enable and strengthen commanders’ effectiveness and
efficiency, motivate and promote military discipline, improve unit performance
and management excellence up and down the chain of command, in units and
staffs, as well as identify issues interfering with effectiveness, efficiency,
compliance, discipline, readiness, performance, surety and management
excellence. The Inspectors General reports on readiness, economy, efficiency,
and state of discipline of Air Force organizations to the Secretary of the Air
Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">7.3. Philosophy. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">Inspection is an inherent function of command exercised at
every level to evaluate readiness, economy, efficiency and state of discipline.
Inspection preparation, if not directly aligned with mission readiness, is
inherently wasteful. Units will be inspection ready when commander’s focus on
mission readiness and on building a culture of disciplined compliance in which
every Airmen does their job right the first time even when no one’s looking.
The intent of the Inspector General is to continuously improve the Air Force
inspection system so there is an ever-shrinking difference – both real and
perceived – between mission readiness and inspection readiness. Each major
command commander and Wing commander will appoint an Inspector General who will
establish an inspection program consistent with major command mission
requirements to inspect unit effectiveness, surety and other inspection program
elements. Major Command Inspectors General establish inspection programs
consistent with command mission requirements and in accordance with this
instruction to assess unit readiness, economy, efficiency, and state of
discipline. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">7.4. Inspection Types: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">7.4.1. <b class="calibre1">Commander’s Inspection Program.</b> A validated
and trusted commander’s inspection program is the cornerstone of the Air Force
inspection system. The Wing Inspector General is responsible to validate and
verify self-assessment programs and independently assess the performance of
organizations below the Wing level. The commander’s inspection program should
give the Wing Commander, subordinate commanders and wing Airmen the right
information at the right time to assess risk, identify areas of improvement,
determine root cause and precisely focus limited resources; all aligned with
the commander’s priorities and on the commander’s timeline. The commander’s
inspection program also facilitates requests for targeted assistance from the
major command commander and staff when and where needed. The commander’s
inspection program produces two key components: (1) the self-assessment
program; and (2) the Wing’s Inspection Program executed under the authority of
the Wing Inspector General to validate and verify commander self-assessments
are accurate and timely, and independently assess effectiveness of subordinate
units and programs. These components provide critical data to leadership about
the adequacy of policy, training, manpower, funds, equipment, and facilities. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">7.4.2. <b class="calibre1">Unit Effectiveness Inspection.</b> The unit
effectiveness inspection integrates elements of compliance and readiness using
specific Inspector General Inspection elements to assess the effectiveness of a
unit. Conducted by Major Command Inspectors General and the Air Force
Inspection Agency on Wings and Wing-equivalents, the unit effectiveness
inspection is a continual evaluation of performance throughout the inspection
period. This is a photo album versus a snapshot. The unit effectiveness
inspection inspects the following four Major Graded Areas: Managing Resources,
Leading People, Improving the Unit, and Executing the Mission. The unit
effectiveness inspection validates and verifies a wing commander’s inspection
program for accuracy and adequacy, and provides an independent assessment of the
Wing’s resource management, leadership, process improvement efforts and ability
to execute the mission. A unit effectiveness inspection is a multi-year,
continual inspection of the unit’s effectiveness, and is intended to help the
wing commander understand the areas of greatest risk from undetected
non-compliance. The next inspection period begins immediately following the
Unit Effectiveness Inspection Capstone event. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">7.4.3. <b class="calibre1">Nuclear Surety Inspection. </b>Nuclear Surety
Inspections are an integral part of the Air Force Inspection System and are
considered a snapshot within a wing’s Unit Effectiveness Inspection cycle.
Major Command Inspector General’s use performance and compliance-based
inspections to evaluate a unit’s ability to manage nuclear resources while
complying with all nuclear surety standards. Additionally, during a Nuclear
Surety Inspection a unit’s capability to safely and reliably receive, store,
secure, assemble, transport, maintain, load, mate, lock/unlock, test, render
safe and employ nuclear weapons is evaluated.  </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">7.5. Inspection Elements: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">7.5.1. <b class="calibre1">Self-Assessment Program.</b> Led by unit
commanders in accordance with Title 10, United States Code, Section 8583, the
self-assessment program provides commanders with a means for internal
assessment of a Wing’s overall health and complements external assessments. The
primary purpose of the self-assessment program for the commander is to
accurately identify and report issues to the command chain. Self-Assessment
programs may include a wide variety of internal assessments or evaluations. At
a minimum, Commanders must utilize Management Internal Control Toolset and
applicable self-assessment communicators. Commanders are encouraged to include
additional measures as directed by superior Commanders, functional directives,
or proven lessons and experience.  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">7.5.2. <b class="calibre1">Management Internal Control Toolset.</b>
Management Internal Control Toolset is an Air Force program of record used to
facilitate self-assessments and communicate compliance, risk and program
health. Management Internal Control Toolset provides the supervisor and command
chain, from Squadron Commander to Secretary of the Air Force, tiered visibility
into user-selected compliance reports and program status. Management Internal
Control Toolset also allows functional area managers the ability to virtually
monitor unit performance and status. Additionally, Management Internal Control
Toolset can assist Inspectors General by informing the risk-based sampling
strategy and formulating specific inspection methodology and Inspector General
Team composition for the commander’s inspection program and on-site unit
effectiveness inspection events.  </p>

<p class="msonormal8">7.5.3.<b class="calibre1"> Self-Assessment Communicator.</b> A
Self-Assessment Communicator is a two-way communication tool designed to
improve compliance with published guidance and communicate risk and program
health up and down the chain of command in near real-time. Compliance with a
self-assessment communicator does not relieve individual Airmen from complying
with all statutory and regulatory requirements in Air Force instructions and
directives at the local, state or federal level. As a self-assessment tool,
Self-Assessment Communicators ask Airmen at the shop-level to self-report
compliance or non-compliance. While the responses are assumed to be truthful
and timely, self-assessment communicators are frequently verified for accuracy
and currency by wing Inspectors General and major command Inspectors General. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">7.5.4.<b class="calibre1"> Inspector General’s Evaluation Management System.</b>
The Inspectors General Evaluation Management System is the official program of
record for the Air Force Inspection System. Inspectors General will use
Inspectors General Evaluation Management System to record the unit’s overall
rating, identify deficiencies, track corrective action plans, and post the
final inspection report. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">7.6. Gatekeeper Program.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">The Gatekeeper program is used to build schedules,
synchronize and align Air Force and non-Air Force inspection requirements.  </p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Section
7C—Inspector General Complaints Program </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">7.7. Program Policy and Mission Focus. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">The Air Force Inspector General Complaints program is a
leadership tool that indicates where command involvement is needed to correct
systematic, programmatic, or procedural weaknesses. The program also ensures
effective and efficient use of resources; resolves problems affecting the Air
Force mission promptly and objectively; creates an atmosphere of trust in which
issues can be objectively and fully resolved without retaliation or fear of
reprisal; and assists commanders in instilling confidence in Air Force
leadership. The primary charge of the Inspector General is to sustain a
credible Air Force Inspector General system by ensuring the existence of
responsive complaint investigations, and fraud, waste, and abuse programs
characterized by objectivity, integrity, and impartiality. Only the Inspector
General may investigate allegations of reprisal and restriction under the
Military Whistleblower’s Protection Act. The Inspector General ensures the
concerns of Regular Air Force, Reserve, and Guard members; civilian employees;
family members; retirees; and the best interests of the Air Force are addressed
through objective fact-finding. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><b class="calibre1">7.8. Installation Inspector General Program. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">The concept of separate, full-time installation Inspectors
General was implemented to remove any perceived conflict of interest, lack of
independence, or apprehension by Air Force personnel. This came as a result of
the previous practice of assigning a chain of command and Inspector General
roles to the same official. The installation Inspector General is organized as
a staff function reporting directly to the installation commander. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">7.8.1.<b class="calibre1"> Inspector General Role. </b>Inspectors
General are the “eyes and ears” of the commander. They execute the commander’s
inspection program, validating and verifying unit self-assessments and
providing the commander an independent assessment of unit effectiveness: (1)
they inform the commander of potential areas of concern as reflected by trends;
(2) function as the fact finder and honest broker in the resolution of
complaints; (3) educate and train commanders and members of the base population
on their rights and responsibilities in regard to the Air Force Inspector
General system; and (4) help commanders prevent, detect, and correct fraud,
waste and abuse; and mismanagement. Personal complaints and fraud, waste, and
abuse disclosures help commanders discover and correct problems that affect the
productivity and morale of assigned personnel. Resolving the underlying cause
of a complaint may prevent more severe symptoms or costly consequences, such as
reduced performance, accidents, poor quality work, poor morale, or loss of
resources. Even though allegations may not be substantiated, the evidence or
investigation findings may reveal systemic morale or other problems that impede
efficiency and mission effectiveness. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">7.8.2.<b class="calibre1"> Investigations Not Covered and Complaints Not
Appropriate.</b><span class="calibre4"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal14">The following are not covered under the Inspector General
Complaint Resolution program: </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.8.2.1. Administrative inquiries or investigations
governed by other policy directives and instructions. These inquiries and
investigations include: </p>

<p class="msonormal15">7.8.2.1.1. Commander-directed inquiries and investigations.
</p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.8.2.1.2. Air Force Office of Special Investigations or
security forces investigations. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.8.2.1.3. Investigations of civilian employees who have
specific appeal rights under law or labor union agreements. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.8.2.2. Investigations under the authority of the Uniform
Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) or the <i class="calibre3">Manual for Courts-Martial</i>, line
of duty or report of survey investigations, quality assurance in the Air Force
medical service boards, Air Force mishap or safety investigations, military
equal opportunity treatment or civilian equal employment opportunity programs,
and medical incident investigations. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.8.2.3. Matters normally addressed through other
established grievance or appeal channels unless there is evidence these
channels mishandled the matter or process. If a policy directive or instruction
provides a specific means of redress or appeal to a grievance, complainants
must exhaust these means before filing an Inspector General complaint.
Complainants must provide some relevant evidence that the process was
mishandled or handled prejudicially before an Inspector General channel will
process a complaint of mishandling. Dissatisfaction or disagreement with the
outcome or findings of an alternative grievance or appeal process is not a
sufficient basis to warrant an Inspector General investigation. <b class="calibre1">Note:<i class="calibre3"> </i></b>AFI
90-301, <i class="calibre3">Inspector General Complaints Resolution</i>, Table 3.6, assists
Inspectors General in determining if a complaint belongs in other channels. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.8.3.<b class="calibre1"> Filing an Inspector General Complaint. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Air Force military members and civilian employees have a
duty to promptly report fraud, waste and abuse or gross mismanagement; a
violation of law, policy, procedures, or regulations; an injustice; abuse of
authority, inappropriate conduct, or misconduct; and a deficiency or like
condition to an appropriate supervisor or commander, to an Inspector General or
other appropriate inspector, or through an established grievance channel.
Complainants should attempt to resolve the issues at the lowest possible level
using command channels before addressing them to a higher level or the
Inspector General. The immediate supervisory command chain can often resolve
complaints more quickly and effectively than a higher level not familiar with
the situation. Use the Inspector General system when referral to the chain of
command is futile, and there is fear of reprisal. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.8.4.<b class="calibre1"> Procedures for Filing a Complaint. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Table 7.1 outlines the procedures for filing an Inspector
General complaint. Complainants complete an Air Force Form 102,<i class="calibre3"> Inspector
General Personal and Fraud, Waste and Abuse Complaint Registration</i>,<b class="calibre1"> </b>briefly
outlining the facts and relevant background information related to the issue or
complaint. AFI 90-301<i class="calibre3"> </i>outlines the procedures. Complainants may also
file anonymously through an Air Force fraud, waste, and abuse hotline, the
Defense hotline, or directly with an Inspector General. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.8.5.<b class="calibre1"> Complainants’ Rights. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Complainants have the right to: </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.8.5.1. File an Inspector General complaint at any level
without notifying or following the chain of command. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.8.5.2. File a complaint with an Inspector General without
fear of reprisal. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.8.5.3. Request withdrawal of their complaint in writing;
however, Inspectors General may still look into the allegations at their
discretion. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.8.5.4. Request the next higher level Inspector General
review their case within 90 days of receiving a final Inspector General
response. Must give specific reasons as to why the complainant believes the
original investigation was not valid or adequate; simply disagreeing with the
findings is not sufficient for an additional Inspector General review. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.8.5.5. Submit complaints anonymously. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.8.5.6. Submit a complaint on behalf of another individual
or even when not the wronged party. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.8.5.7. Request whistleblower protection after making or
planning to make a protected communication. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.8.5.7.1. Reprisal occurs when a responsible management
official<i class="calibre3"> </i>takes (or threatens to take) an unfavorable personnel action;
or withholds (or threatens to withhold) a favorable personnel action, to
retaliate against a member of the armed forces who made, or prepared to make, a
protected communication. Any lawful communication, regardless of the subject,
to an Inspector General or Congress, is considered protected. Additionally,
this type of communication is protected when a member who reasonably believes
he/she has evidence of a violation of law or regulation<i class="calibre3"> </i>(regardless of
whether he/she is the victim), discloses this to an authorized recipient in the
form of a lawful communication. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">7.8.5.7.2. Title 10, United States
Code, Section 1034, <i class="calibre3">Protected Communications; Prohibition of Retaliatory
Personnel Actions</i>, also states that a military member may not be restricted<i class="calibre3">
</i>or prohibited from making a lawful communication to the Inspector General
or a member of Congress (for example, making a protected communication).
Restriction can result from either private or public statements that may
reasonably discourage Air </p>

<p class="msonormal16">Force members from contacting the Inspector General or a
member of Congress. For example, a first sergeant who </p>

<p class="msonormal24">directs a member to stay within his chain of command
because the member told his supervisor he was going to complain to his
Congressman about an upcoming deployment has probably restricted. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.8.5.7.3. The Department of Defense Inspector General
provides a quarterly report to Congress detailing the Services’ Inspector
General allegations of reprisal, and restricted (if substantiated, amounts to a
violation of Federal law). In the Air Force, most allegations in these areas
are against First Sergeants and senior enlisted personnel. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.8.6.<b class="calibre1"> Complainants’ Responsibilities. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal14">Complainants must file within one year of learning of the
alleged wrong. Inspector General complaints not reported within one year may
seriously impede the gathering of evidence and testimony. The Inspector General
may dismiss a complaint if, given the nature of the alleged wrong and the
passage of time, there is reasonable probability that insufficient information
can be gathered to make a determination, or no special Air Force interests
exist to justify investigating the matter. Complainants must cooperate with
investigators by providing factual and relevant information regarding the
issues. Complainants must understand that they are submitting official
statements; therefore, they remain subject to punitive action for knowingly
making false statements and submitting other unlawful communications. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.8.7.<b class="calibre1"> Confidentiality Policy. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal23">The Inspector General makes every
effort to protect the identity of complainants from anyone outside Inspector
General channels. Inspectors General may release the name of a complainant only
on an official need-to-know basis. </p>

<p class="msonormal25">Investigating officers do not divulge a complainant’s name
to a subject or witness or permit them to read the complaint without the
Inspectors General or appointing authority’s written permission. </p>

7D—Individual Standards </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal10"><b class="calibre1">7.9. Enforcing Individual Standards. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">Commanders, supervisors, and other persons in authority can
issue administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands. These actions are
intended to improve, correct, and instruct subordinates who depart from
standards of performance, conduct, bearing, and integrity, on or off duty, and
whose actions degrade the individual and unit’s mission. Written administrative
counseling, admonitions, and reprimands are subject to the rules of access,
protection, and disclosure outlined in the Privacy Act of 1974. The same rules
apply to copies kept by supervisors and commanders and those filed in an
individual’s unfavorable information file or the unit’s personnel information
file. Raters must consider making comments on performance reports when the
ratee receives any of these adverse actions. The following paragraphs discuss
actions a commander may take to correct an individual’s behavior without
resorting to punishment under the UCMJ. </p>

<p class="msonormal26"><b class="calibre1">7.10. Administrative Counseling, Admonitions, and
Reprimands.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal27">Administrative
counseling, admonitions, and reprimands are quality force management tools
available to supervisors, superiors, and commanders. These tools are corrective
in nature, not punitive. When properly used, they help maintain established Air
Force standards and enhance mission accomplishment. When a member departs from
standards, there are many factors to consider in determining what action, if
any, is appropriate. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.10.1. <b class="calibre1">AFI 36-2907, Unfavorable Information File (UIF)
Program.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.10.1.1. Chapter 4 contains guidance on administrative
counseling, admonitions, and reprimands. The decision to issue a letter of
counseling, admonition, or reprimand should be based primarily on two factors. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.10.1.1.1. First is the nature of the incident.
Administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands may be administered for
any departure from Air Force standards. Unlike nonjudicial punishment under
Article 15 of the UCMJ, they are NOT limited to offenses punishable by the
UCMJ. (These disciplinary measures may also be issued to Reserve members who
commit an offense while in civilian (non-Title 10) status.) The seriousness of
the departure should be considered before deciding what type of action is
appropriate to take. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.10.1.1.2. Second is the previous disciplinary record of
the member. Counseling, admonitions, and reprimands should be used as part of a
graduated pattern of discipline in response to repeated departures from
standards. In other words, each time a service member departs from standards,
the response should usually be more severe. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.10.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Standard of Proof</b>. While no specific
standard of proof applies to administrative action proceedings, commanders
should utilize the “preponderance of the evidence” standard when evaluating the
evidence and every element of the offenses committed. A preponderance of the
evidence means simply the greater weight of credible evidence. Whether such
proof is available should be considered before initiating the administrative
action. If such proof is lacking, administrative action is susceptible to being
found to be legally unsupportable and, as a result, could be set aside. There
is no requirement to prove any allegation beyond a reasonable doubt.” </p>

<p class="msonormal28">7.10.2. <b class="calibre1">Letter of Counseling and Air Force IMT 174, Record
of Individual Counseling. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">A letter of counseling is the lowest level of
administrative action. Counseling helps people develop good judgment, assume
responsibility, and face and solve their problems. Counselors help subordinates
develop skills, attitudes, and behaviors consistent with maintaining the Air
Force readiness. First-line supervisors, first sergeants, and commanders
routinely counsel individuals verbally or in writing, giving advice and
reassuring subordinates about specific situations. A verbal counseling may be
recorded on a record of individual counseling. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.10.3. <b class="calibre1">Letter of Admonishment.<i class="calibre3"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">An admonishment is more severe than a letter of counseling
or a record of individual counseling. Use an admonishment to document an
infraction serious enough to warrant a letter of admonishment. Do not use it
when a reprimand is more appropriate. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.10.4. <b class="calibre1">Letter of Reprimand.<i class="calibre3"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">A reprimand is more severe than a letter of counseling or
letter of admonishment and indicates a stronger degree of official censure.
Commanders may elect to file a letter of reprimand in a UIF for enlisted
personnel. </p>

<p class="msonormal29">7.10.5. <b class="calibre1">Issuing the Letter of Counseling, Record of
Individual Counseling, Letter of Admonishments, or Letter of Reprimands. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal30">Counseling,
admonitions, and reprimands may be either verbal or written. The counseling,
admonition, or reprimand should be in writing because the corrective action is
more meaningful to the member and the infraction is documented. Letter of
counseling, letter of admonishments and letter of reprimands should be typed on
letterhead and must comply with the requirements listed below. Failure to
follow the requirements for drafting and maintaining these documents could
limit the use of the documents in a subsequent proceeding. Failing to include
the second endorsement noting the consideration of a response, for example,
will likely render a letter of reprimand inadmissible in a later court-martial
or discharge proceeding. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">7.10.6. Written letter of counseling, letter of
admonishments and letter of reprimands must state the following: </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.10.6.1. What the member did or failed to do, citing
specific incidents and their dates. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.10.6.2. What improvement is expected. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.10.6.3. That further deviation may result in more severe
action. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">7.10.6.4. That the
individual has 3 duty days to respond and provide rebuttal matters (45 days for
non-extended Regular Air Force reservists). </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.10.6.5. That all supporting documents become part of the
record. </p>

<p class="msonormal31">7.10.6.6. That the
person who initiates the letter of counseling, letter of admonishments and

individual has 3 duty days to acknowledge the intended actions and provide
pertinent information before the commander makes the final decision on placing
optional documents in the UIF. The commander advises the individual of his or
her final decision; and, if the commander decides to file the information in a
UIF, the individual’s response is also filed. </p>

UIF: the member, commander, first sergeant, enlisted performance report
reporting and rating officials, force support squadron personnel, Inspector
General, inspection team, legal office personnel, military equal opportunity
personnel, law enforcement personnel and substance abuse counselors authorized
by the commander to review the document in the course of their official Air Force
duties. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.11.4.2. All UIFs require periodic review to ensure
continued maintenance of documents in the UIF is proper. The unit commander
must review all UIFs within 90 days of assuming or being appointed to command.
UIFs are also reviewed when individuals are considered for promotion,
reenlistment, permanent change of station, permanent change of assignment, and
voluntary or mandatory reclassification or retraining. UIFs are also reviewed
annually, with the assistance of the staff judge advocate. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.11.5. <b class="calibre1">Removing UIFs or Documents within UIFs.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal23">Commanders keep the UIF and documents

guidance on disposition dates. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">Commanders initiate removal action via Air Force IMT 1058,
and the individual acknowledges the action. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><b class="calibre1">7.12. Control Roster. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">The control roster is a rehabilitative tool commanders may
use to establish a 6-month observation period for individuals whose duty
performance is substandard or who fail to meet or maintain Air Force standards
of conduct, bearing, and integrity, on or off duty. A single incident of
substandard performance or an isolated breach of standards, not likely to be
repeated, should not ordinarily be a basis for a control roster action.
Commanders should consider prior incidents, acts, failures, counseling, and
rehabilitative efforts. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">7.12.1.<b class="calibre1"> Use.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">A commander may direct an enlisted performance report
before entering or removing an individual from the roster, or both. The
commander cannot place an individual on the roster as a substitute for more
appropriate administrative, judicial, or nonjudicial action. Being on the
roster does not shield an individual from other actions. An individual cannot
remain on the roster for more than 6 consecutive months. If a member is not
rehabilitated in this time, the commander initiates more severe action. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.12.2. <b class="calibre1">Initiating and Maintaining the Control Roster.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal16">Commanders place an individual on the control roster by
using Air Force IMT 1058, which puts the member on notice that his/her
performance and behavior must improve or he/she will face more severe
administrative action or punishment. The individual acknowledge receipt of the
action and has 3 duty days to respond and submit a statement on his or her
behalf before the Air Force IMT 1058 is finalized.<span class="calibre29"> </span>Placement on the control roster is a mandatory UIF
entry. The 6-month time period begins the day the Air Force IMT 1058 is
finalized and ends at 2400 hours 6 months later. For example, if placed on the
roster 1 January, this action expires at 2400 on 30 June. An individual’s time
does not stop and start for periods of temporary duty, ordinary leave, or a change
in immediate supervisor. The commander can remove an enlisted member early from
the control roster using Air Force IMT 1058. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.13.1. <b class="calibre1">Reasons for Demotion.<i class="calibre3"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal14">Common reasons for the administrative demotion of Airmen
include failure to: </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.13.1.1. Complete officer transitional training for
reasons of academic deficiency, self-elimination, or misconduct. Trainees will
be demoted to the grade they formerly held. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.13.1.2. Maintain or attain the appropriate grade and

<p class="msonormal30">7.13.1.5. Termination
of student status of members attending temporary duty Air Force schools. </p>

<p class="msonormal39">7.13.2.
<b class="calibre2">Demotion Procedure:<i class="calibre30"> </i></b>7.13.2.1. The immediate commander notifies
the member in writing of the intention to recommend demotion, citing the
paragraph, the demotion authority if other than the initiating commander, and
the recommended grade. The notification must also include the specific reasons
for the demotion and a complete summary of the supporting facts. 7.13.2.2. The
commander informs the member of their right to counsel and the right to respond
within 3 duty days. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">The commander must also
inform eligible members of their right to apply for retirement in lieu of
demotion. Following the member’s response, if the commander elects to continue
the proceedings, the case file is forwarded with a summary of the member’s
written and verbal statements to the force support squadron for processing
prior to forwarding to the demotion authority. The member must be notified in
writing of the decision to forward the action to the demotion authority. The
demotion authority obtains a written legal review before making a decision. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.13.3. <b class="calibre1">Appeal Policy.<i class="calibre3"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Airmen may appeal a demotion decision. The appellate
authority for Airmen in the grades of Airman through Master Sergeant is the
next level commander above the group commander. The appellate authority for
Airmen in the grades of Senior Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant is the
Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, unless the major command, field operating
agency, or direct reporting unit commander delegated demotion authority to a
subordinate level. If delegated, the major command, field operating agency, or
direct reporting unit commander then becomes the appellate authority for
demotion appeals of Senior Master Sergeants and Chief Master Sergeants. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">7.14. Administrative Separations.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal27">The suitability of
persons to serve in the Air Force is judged on the basis of their conduct and
their ability to meet required standards of duty performance and discipline.
Separating members failing to meet standards of performance, conduct, or
discipline, promotes Air Force readiness and strengthens our standards of
military service. Commanders and supervisors must identify enlisted members who
show likelihood for early separation and make reasonable efforts to help these
members meet Air Force standards. Members who do not show potential for further
service should be discharged. Commanders must consult the servicing staff judge
advocate and military personnel flight before initiating the involuntary
separation of a member. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.14.1. <b class="calibre1">Service Characterization.<i class="calibre3"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal40">Airmen who do not qualify for reenlistment receive a
discharge without regard to their remaining Military Service Obligation. The
character of the member’s service is honorable. The service of members
separating at their expiration of term of service, or voluntarily or
involuntarily separating for the convenience of the Government, is
characterized as honorable. The service of members administratively discharged
under AFI 36-3208, <i class="calibre3">Administrative Separation of Airmen,</i> may be
characterized as honorable, general (under honorable conditions), or under
other than honorable conditions. The service characterization depends upon the
reason for the discharge and the member’s military record in the current
enlistment or period of service. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">7.14.1.1. Honorable:
Appropriate when the quality of the member’s service generally has met Air
Force standards of acceptable conduct and performance of duty, or a member’s
service is otherwise so meritorious that any other characterization would be
inappropriate. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">7.14.1.2. General (under
honorable conditions): Appropriate if a member’s service has been honest and
faithful, but significant negative aspects of the member’s conduct or
performance outweigh positive aspects of military record. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">7.14.1.3. Under Other
Than Honorable Conditions: Appropriate if based on a pattern of behavior or one
or more acts or omissions constituting a significant departure from the conduct
expected of Airmen. This characterization can be given only if the member is
offered an administrative discharge board or if a discharge is unconditionally
requested in lieu of trial by court-martial. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">7.14.1.4. A commander
must initiate discharge processing or seek a waiver of the discharge if the
reason for discharge is for fraudulent or erroneous enlistment; civil court
conviction for an offense for which a punitive discharge and confinement for
one year or more would be authorized under the UCMJ; drug abuse; or sexual
assault. A commander must make a discharge or retention recommendation when a
member remains in a poor fitness category for a continuous 12-month period or
receives 4 poor fitness assessments in a 24-month period. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.14.2. <b class="calibre1">Reasons for Separation. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Airmen are entitled to separate at expiration of term of
service unless there is a specific authority for retention or they consent to
retention. Nevertheless, a separation is not automatic; members remain in the
service until separation action is initiated. Many different reasons for
separation exist. The following discussion cannot cover all of them; its purpose
is to briefly identify major reasons for separation and a concise discussion of
each: </p>

<p class="msonormal41">7.14.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Required Separation: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.14.2.1.1. Airmen who will continue to serve in another
military status must separate; for example, an Airman may separate to serve with
the Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard. An Airman may also separate to
accept an appointment as a commissioned officer of the Air Force or to accept
an appointment as a warrant or commissioned officer of another branch of
service. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.14.2.1.2. Airmen with insufficient retainability for
permanent change of station must separate. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.14.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Voluntary Separation. </b>Airmen may ask for
early separation for the convenience of the Government if they meet the
criteria. Entering an officer training program, pregnancy, conscientious
objection, hardship, and early release to attend school are some of the reasons
for which members may be allowed to separate. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.14.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Involuntary Separation. </b>Physical
conditions that interfere with duty performance or assignment availability,
inability to cope with parental responsibilities or military duty, or
insufficient retainability for required retraining are reasons for involuntary
discharge for the convenience of the Government. Defective enlistment
(fraudulent or erroneous) is also a basis for discharge. Airmen are subject to
discharge for cause based on such factors as unsatisfactory performance,
substance abuse, misconduct, or in the interest of national security. </p>

<p class="msonormal42">7.14.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Discharge Instead of Trial by Court-Martial. </b>If
charges have been preferred against an Airman and if the UCMJ authorizes
punitive discharge as punishment for the offense, the Airman may request an
administrative discharge instead of trial by court-martial. There is no
guarantee, however, that the Airman’s request will be granted. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Section

<p class="msonormal26"><b class="calibre1">7.15. Military Law, a</b> <b class="calibre1">Separate Judicial System. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">Effective leadership is the most desirable means of
maintaining standards. Military law provides commanders the tools, including
court-martial and nonjudicial punishment, to deal with criminal conduct. The
purpose of military law is <b class="calibre1">Figure 7.</b><span class="calibre31"> </span><b class="calibre1">1. The Military

the military establishment, and to thereby strengthen the national security of
the U.S. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.15.1. <b class="calibre1">The U.S. Constitution.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal44">The U.S. Constitution is the
primary source of our military law. The framers of the U.S. Constitution gave
Congress the authority to make rules for the military, and Congress and the
President have used their combined authority to create the military justice
system currently in place (Figure 7.1). The U.S. Constitution designates the
President as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces and vests </p>

<p class="msonormal16">the power to carry out the responsibilities of this
position. Congress has the power to raise an Army and Navy, control the
military budget, and make rules for the government of the Army and Navy. This
separation of power is an important element of our military justice system. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.15.2.<b class="calibre1"> UCMJ and the Manual for Courts-Martial:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.15.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> UCMJ. </b>In 1950, Congress enacted the UCMJ,
and President Harry S. Truman signed it into law. The UCMJ became effective 31
May 1951. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.15.2.2. <b class="calibre1">The Manual for Courts-Martial. </b>In 1951,
President Truman created the Manual for Courts-Martial by executive order. The
Manual for Courts-Martial sets out rules for evidence, procedure, maximum
punishments, and provides standardized forms. The Manual for Courts-Martial is
intended to provide military law guidance to commanders and judge advocates and
is revised annually. Furthermore, the manual contains a wide range of
materials, including the U.S. Constitution, the UCMJ (including text and
discussion of the punitive articles, as well as sample specifications), rules
for courts-martial, and military rules of evidence.  </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.15.3.<b class="calibre1"> Legal Rights. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Members of the Armed Forces retain virtually all the legal
rights they held as civilians before entering the military, including
protection against involuntary self-incrimination and the right to counsel. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">7.15.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Self-incrimination: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.15.3.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> Involuntary Self-incrimination</b><span class="calibre4">. </span>The Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution states that no person shall be compelled to be a witness against
him or herself. Article 31, UCMJ, and military rules of evidence 304 reflect
this right and prohibit involuntary statements from being used against an
accused. A statement is “involuntary” when obtained in violation of the Fifth
Amendment, Article 31, or through the use of coercion, unlawful influence, or
unlawful inducement. The UCMJ requires that prior to interrogation or any
requests for a statement from a person suspected of an offense, the person must
be first told of the nature of the accusation, advised that he or she does not
have to make any statement regarding the offense, and that any statement he or
she makes may be used as evidence against him or her in a trial by
court-martial. Prior to interrogation, the suspect is entitled to consult with
counsel and to have such counsel present at the interrogation. If counsel is
requested, questioning must cease until counsel is present. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.15.3.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Statements. </b>Once properly advised of his
or her rights, a person may waive these rights and choose to make a statement.
Assuming this waiver is made freely, knowingly, and intelligently, any subsequent
statement can be used as evidence in a court-martial or other judicial or
administrative proceedings. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">7.15.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> Right to Counsel: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal23">7.15.3.2.1. The UCMJ provides an
accused the right to be represented by a military attorney before summary,
special, and general courts-martial; Article 32 preliminary hearings; and in
the Article 15 process free of charge. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">The area defense
counsel program provides Air Force members independent legal representation.
Airmen suspected of an offense or facing adverse administrative actions receive
confidential legal advice from an experienced judge advocate general outside
the local chain of command, avoiding conflicts of interest or command
influence. </p>

<p class="msonormal46">7.15.3.2.2. The area defense counsel program, established
in 1974, made the Air Force the first service to create a totally independent
defense function. Area defense counsel are assigned to the Air Force Judiciary,
which falls under the Air Force Legal Operations Agency at Joint Base
Andrews-Naval Air Facility Washington. Although located at most major bases,
the area defense counsel works for a separate chain of command and reports only
to senior defense attorneys. The area defense counsel does not report to anyone
at base level, including the wing commander and the base staff judge advocate.
This separate chain of command ensures undivided loyalty to the client.  </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.15.3.2.3. Area defense counsel work to protect a client’s
individual interests and ensure the independent and zealous representation of a
client facing military justice action or other adverse actions, thereby
promoting discipline and strengthening confidence in justice. Most area defense
counsel are selected from the local base legal office, but to ensure further
independence, they are not rotated back to the base legal office when their
area defense counsel assignments are completed.  </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.15.3.2.4. Before selection as an area defense counsel, a
judge advocate will be carefully screened for the proper level of judgment,
advocacy skills, and courtroom experience. Additionally, other experienced
trial advocates (senior defense counsel) travel to assist in the defense of
particularly complex courts-martial. Area defense counsel are supported by
defense paralegals, who are enlisted personnel. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">7.16. Military Jurisdiction in Action: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.16.1.<b class="calibre1"> Apprehension and Pretrial Restraint:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.16.1.1. <b class="calibre1">Apprehension. </b>Apprehension is the act of
taking a person into custody and the equivalent of a civilian “arrest.”
Military law enforcement officers, military criminal investigators and persons
on guard or performing police duties are authorized to apprehend persons subject
to UCMJ jurisdiction, and arrest and temporarily detain persons subject to the
military extraterritorial jurisdiction act, when there is probable cause that
an offense has been committed and that the person committed it. Although all
commissioned, warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers on Regular Air Force
may apprehend persons subject to UCMJ jurisdiction, absent exigent
circumstances, the apprehension of civilians should be done by law enforcement
personnel. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.16.1.1.1. An apprehension is made by clearly notifying
the person orally or in writing that he or she is in custody. The simple
statement, “You are under apprehension,” is usually sufficient to provide
notice. During apprehension, such force and means as are reasonably necessary
under the circumstances to effect the apprehension are authorized. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.16.1.1.2. NCOs not otherwise performing law enforcement
duties may apprehend commissioned or warrant officers only on specific orders
from a commissioned officer or when such apprehension prevents disgrace to the
service or to prevent the commission of a serious offense or escape of someone
who has committed a serious offense. The immediate commander of an apprehended
person should be promptly notified.  </p>

<p class="msonormal47">7.16.1.2.<b class="calibre1"> Pretrial Restraint. </b>Pretrial restraint is
moral or physical restraint on a person’s liberty that is imposed before and
during the disposition of offenses. Pretrial restraint may include conditions
on liberty, restrictions, arrest, or confinement. Only an officer’s commander
can order pretrial restraint of an officer; this authority cannot be delegated.
Any commissioned officer may order pretrial restraint of any enlisted person.
An enlisted person’s commander may also delegate such restraint authority to an
NCO. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.16.1.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Conditions on Liberty. </b>Conditions on
liberty are imposed directing a person to do or refrain from doing specified
acts; examples include orders to report periodically to a specified official,
orders to stay away from a certain place (such as the scene of the alleged offense),
and orders not to associate with specified persons (such as the alleged victim
or potential witnesses). However, conditions on liberty must not hinder
pretrial preparation. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.16.1.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Restrictions in Lieu of Arrest. </b>Restriction
imposes restraint on a person to remain within specified limits, but is less
severe than arrest. The geographic limits are usually broader (for example,
restriction to the limits of the installation), and the offender will perform
full military duties unless otherwise directed. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.16.1.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Arrest. </b>In the Armed Forces, the term
“arrest” means the limiting of a person’s liberty. Arrest is not imposed as
punishment for an offense. The notification of arrest directs a person to
remain within specified limits. Arrest is a moral restraint; no physical
restraint is exercised to prevent a person from breaking arrest. A person in
arrest is not expected to perform full military duties. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.16.1.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Confinement. </b>Confinement is physical
restraint, such as imprisonment in a confinement facility. Individuals are put
in pretrial confinement only when lesser forms of pretrial restraint are
inadequate. When a person is ordered into confinement they have the right to
retain civilian counsel (at their own expense) or to request military counsel be
assigned (at no expense to the accused). They also have the right to a prompt
review of their status. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.16.1.3. <b class="calibre1">Use of Pretrial Restraint. </b>Pretrial
restraint may only be ordered if there is a reasonable belief that the person
committed an offense triable by court-martial and the circumstances require
restraint. Factors to consider in ordering pretrial restraint include whether
one can foresee that the person will not appear at trial or will engage in
serious criminal misconduct while awaiting court-martial. Pretrial restraint
should not be more rigorous than the circumstances require. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.16.2. <b class="calibre1">Search and Seizure:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.16.2.1. The fourth amendment to the U.S. Constitution
protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. The authorization to
search must be based on probable cause and particularly describe the place to
be searched and the persons or things to be seized. </p>

<p class="msonormal48">7.16.2.2. Probable cause to search exists when there is a
reasonable belief that the person, property, or evidence sought is located in
the place or on the person to be searched.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.16.2.3. “Authorization to search” is the military
equivalent of a civilian search warrant. A search authorization is an express
permission, written or oral, issued by a competent military authority to search
a person or an area for specified property or evidence or to search for a
specific person and to seize such property, evidence, or person. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">7.16.2.4. Commanders,
as well as military judges, installation commanders, and magistrates, are
authorized to direct inspections of persons and property under your command and
to authorize probable cause searches and seizures over anyone subject to
military law or at any place on the installation. However, a commander who
authorizes a search or seizure must be neutral and detached from the case and
facts. Therefore, the command functions of gathering facts and maintaining
overall military discipline must remain separate from the legal decision to
grant search authorization. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">7.16.2.5. The
installation commander has discretion to appoint, in writing, up to two
military magistrates who may also authorize search and seizure (including
apprehension) requests. Each magistrate must receive training provided by the
staff judge advocate on search and seizure issues. </p>

<p class="msonormal49">7.16.3. <b class="calibre1">Inspections.</b> An
inspection is of a person, property or premises for the primary purpose of
determining and ensuring the security, military fitness, or good order and
discipline of a unit, organization or installation. Commanders may conduct
inspections of their units. Inspections are not searches. The distinction
between a search and an inspection is that an inspection is not conducted for
the primary purpose of obtaining evidence for use in a trial or other
disciplinary proceedings and does not focus on a particular suspect or
individual. Contraband seized during an inspection (for example, vehicle entry
checks, and random drug testing) is admissible in court. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">7.17.</b> <b class="calibre1">Nonjudicial Punishment—Article 15. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">Nonjudicial punishment is authorized under Article 15, UCMJ.
Often referred to as an “Article 15,” nonjudicial punishment provides
commanders with an essential and prompt means of maintaining good order and
discipline without the stigma of a court-martial conviction. An Article 15 may
be imposed for minor offenses. Any Air Force member can be punished by Article
15. Commanders are encouraged to take nonpunitive disciplinary actions, such as
counseling and administrative reprimand, before resorting to Article 15.
However, such measures are not required before an Article 15 can be offered. An
Article 15 should not be offered unless the commander is prepared to proceed
with court-martial charges because an Article 15 cannot be imposed upon a
member who demands trial by court-martial. </p>

<p class="msonormal50">7.17.1. <b class="calibre1">Minor Offense. </b>Whether
an offense is minor depends on several factors and is a matter left to the
imposing commander’s discretion. Besides the nature of the offense, the
commander should also consider the offender’s age, grade, duty assignments,
record, experience, and the maximum sentence imposable for the offense if tried
by a general court-martial. Ordinarily, a minor offense is an offense in which
the maximum sentence imposable would not include a dishonorable discharge or
confinement for more than 1 year if tried by a general court-martial.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.17.2. <b class="calibre1">Punishments Under Article 15. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">The type and permissible extent of punishment are limited
by both the imposing commander’s grade and the offender’s grade as reflected in
Table 7.2. Punishments may include reduction in grade, forfeiture of pay,
restrictions, extra duties, and/or correctional custody. </p>

<p class="msonormal51">7.17.3.<b class="calibre1"> Procedures:
</b>7.17.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>While no specific standard of proof is applicable to
nonjudicial punishment proceedings, commanders should recognize that a member
is entitled to demand trial by court-martial, where proof beyond a reasonable
doubt by competent evidence is required for conviction. Commanders should
consider whether such proof is available before initiating action under Article
15. If not, nonjudicial punishment is usually not warranted. Commanders must
confer with the staff judge advocate, or a designee, before initiating
nonjudicial punishment proceedings and before imposing punishment. The staff
judge advocate advises and helps the commander evaluate the facts and determine
what offense was committed. However, the commander makes the decision to impose
punishment and the degree of punishment imposed. The military justice section
of the base legal office prepares the Air Force IMT 3070, <i class="calibre3">Record of
Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.17.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>After the commander determines that
nonjudicial punishment is appropriate, the staff judge advocate prepares an Air
Force Form 3070A, <i class="calibre3">Record of Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings (AB thru
SSgt)</i><b class="calibre1">; </b>Air Force Form 3070B,<b class="calibre1"> </b><i class="calibre3">Record of Nonjudicial
Punishment Proceedings (TSgt thru CMSgt)</i>;<b class="calibre1"> </b>or Air Force Form 3070C,<b class="calibre1">
</b><i class="calibre3">Record of Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings (Officer)</i>. The
commander notifies the member that he or she is considering punishment under
Article 15 by signing the Air Force Form 3070A/B/C and providing it to the
member. The Air Force Form 3070A/B/C includes a statement of the alleged
offenses, the member’s rights, and the maximum punishment allowable. After
receiving the Air Force Form 3070A/B/C, the member has a right to examine all
statements and evidence available to the commander. In practice, the member or
the area defense counsel is provided copies of the evidence used to support the
alleged offenses. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.17.3.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Once offered nonjudicial punishment, a
member must first decide whether to accept. The member has 3 duty days (72
hours) to make the decision. Before making the decision, the member may consult
with area defense counsel. A member’s decision to accept the Article 15 is not
an admission of guilt but is a choice of forum. The member may present matters
orally, in writing, or both and may present witnesses. The member is not
required to present any matters or make any statement and has the right to
remain silent under Article 31(b), UCMJ. </p>

by the member and consulting with the staff judge advocate, the commander will
indicate one of the following decisions and annotate the Air Force Form
3070A/B/C accordingly: </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.17.3.4.1. The member did not commit the offenses alleged,
or nonjudicial punishment is not appropriate, and the proceedings are
terminated. In light of matters in extenuation and mitigation, nonjudicial
punishment is not appropriate, and the proceedings are terminated. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.17.3.4.2. The member committed one or more of the
offenses alleged. (The commander must line out and initial any offenses he or
she determines were not committed.) </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.17.3.4.3. The member committed one or more
lesser-included offenses rather than the offenses listed. </p>

<p class="msonormal46">7.17.3.5. If the commander finds the member committed an
offense, he or she will determine the appropriate punishment and serve it on
the member, notifying the member of the right to appeal. </p>

<p class="msonormal69">7.17.3.6. Members are
entitled to appeal nonjudicial punishment to the next superior authority in the
commander’s chain of command. The member may appeal when he or she considers
the punishment to be unjust or disproportionate to the offense. A member may
assert the punishment was unjust because the offense was not committed. Thus,
the guilty finding, the punishment, or both may be appealed. The member has 5
calendar days to submit a written appeal—an oral statement is not acceptable.
Punishments are not stayed during the appeal process. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">However, if the
commander and/ or appellate authority fail to take action on an appeal within
five days after submission, and if the member so requests, any unexecuted
punishment involving restraint or extra duties will be delayed until after
appeal. The appellate authority may deny all relief, grant partial relief, or
grant all relief requested by the member. The appellate authority’s decision is
final. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.17.4. <b class="calibre1">Suspension, Remission, Mitigation, and Set-Aside
Actions.<i class="calibre3"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">A commander has the power to suspend, remit, or mitigate
punishment of an Article 15. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.17.4.1. <b class="calibre1">Suspension. </b>To suspend punishment is to
postpone application of all or part for a specific probationary period with the
understanding that the punishment will be automatically remitted (cancelled) at
the end of this period if the member does not engage in further misconduct. The
probationary period may not exceed 6 months. Suspension may occur when the
commander imposes the punishment or within 4 months of executing the
punishment. The Manual for Courts-Martial and Air Force policy encourage the
use of suspended sentences as a corrective tool for first-time offenders to
provide both an observation period and an incentive for good behavior.  </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.17.4.2. <b class="calibre1">Remission. </b>Remission is an action whereby
any portion of the unexecuted punishment is cancelled, normally used as a reward
for good behavior or when determined the punishment imposed was too severe for
the particular offense. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.17.4.3. <b class="calibre1">Mitigation. </b>Mitigation is a reduction in
either the quantity or quality of a punishment. Commanders may, at any time,
mitigate any part or amount of the unexecuted portion of the punishment by
changing to a less severe form or reduce the quantity. For example, a reduction
in grade can be mitigated to a forfeiture of pay. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.17.4.4. <b class="calibre1">Set Aside. </b>Setting aside is an action
whereby the punishment, whether executed or unexecuted, is set aside and any
property, privilege, or rights affected by the portion of the punishment set
aside are restored. Commanders use this action only when they believe that
under all the circumstances of the case the punishment has resulted in clear
injustice. </p>

<p class="msonormal26"><b class="calibre1">7.18. Types of Courts-Martial:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal70">7.18.1.<b class="calibre1"> Summary Court-Martial.<i class="calibre3"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">A Summary Court-Martial tries minor offenses. Instead of a
military judge, an Regular Air Force commissioned officer is appointed as the
Summary Court-Martial officer. The accused may have assistance from the area
defense counsel. The Summary Court-Martial considers the evidence, including
witness testimony, and then makes a finding. If the finding is guilty, the
Summary Court-Martial considers any additional evidence before deciding an
appropriate sentence. Only enlisted service members may be tried by Summary
Court-Martial and only if they consent to being tried in that forum. Sentences
are limited as set out in Table 7.3, Line 1, Column F. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.18.2. <b class="calibre1">Special Court-Martial. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Any service member may be tried by a Special Court-Martial.
A Special Court-Martial is the intermediate-level court in the military system.
The Special Court-Martial usually consists of a military judge and a panel
(similar to a civilian jury) of three or more members. Enlisted accused may
request at least one-third of the panel consist of enlisted members. The
accused may request trial by military judge alone. The proceedings include a
trial counsel (prosecutor), defense counsel, the accused, and a court reporter
to record the proceedings. A sentence in a Special Court-Martial may include
any punishment authorized by the Uniform Code of Military Justice except death,
dishonorable discharge, dismissal (in the case of an officer), or confinement
in excess of 1 year. </p>

<p class="msonormal71">7.18.3. <b class="calibre1">General Court-Martial.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">A General Court-Martial tries the most serious offenses.
Cases cannot be referred for trial by General Court-Martial without a
preliminary hearing under Article 32, Uniform of Military Justice. The General
Court-Martial is composed of a military judge and at least a five-member panel,
and may include at least one-third enlisted members, if so requested by an
enlisted accused. The accused may request trial by a military judge alone,
except in a capital case (when a sentence to death may be adjudged). The
maximum authorized punishment this court-martial may impose is the maximum
allowable under the UCMJ for the offenses charged. For some offenses, the
maximum allowable sentence may include death. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">7.19. Court-Martial Procedures: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">7.19.1. <b class="calibre1">Trial.<i class="calibre3"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">When a case is referred to trial, the convening authority,
generally the wing or numbered Air Force commander selects the court-martial
panel. Panel members must be senior in grade to the accused and be the best
qualified. Throughout the court-martial process, commanders and convening
authorities are expressly forbidden to exercise any improper influence on the
action of the court. </p>

<p class="msonormal72">7.19.2. <b class="calibre1">Findings and Sentence.<i class="calibre3"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">The verdict of a court-martial is called the “findings.” An
accused cannot be found guilty unless guilt is proved beyond a reasonable
doubt. A finding of guilty does not require a unanimous agreement, but requires
at least twothirds of the members to vote for a finding of guilty. Voting is by
secret written ballot. In the event of a not-guilty verdict (acquittal), the
trial ends. If there is a finding of guilty, a pre-sentencing procedure follows
immediately to help the court determine an appropriate sentence. A sentence of
death requires a unanimous vote by a panel of twelve members, while a sentence
of confinement in excess of 10 years requires the concurrence of three-fourths
of panel members. </p>

<p class="msonormal108">The military justice system is one tool used to correct
breaches of discipline. NCOs have a general responsibility to be familiar with
the UCMJ and correct marginal or substandard behavior or duty performance of
their subordinates. NCOs must: </p>

<p class="msonormal109">7.22.1. Support their commander in the application of the
military justice system for maintaining order and discipline. </p>

<p class="msonormal109">7.22.2. Become involved when breaches of discipline occur
in their presence and report all such violations to the proper authorities. </p>

<p class="msonormal109">7.22.3. Be prepared to investigate incidents when ordered
to do so. This means that NCOs should be familiar with both the right against
self-incrimination and resources available to assist in conducting the investigation
and should not hesitate to seek advice before acting. </p>

<p class="msonormal109">7.22.4. Be familiar with the rules in the UCMJ for
apprehending, arresting, and confining violators of the UCMJ. </p>

<p class="msonormal109">7.22.5. Be prepared to generally counsel Airmen on their
legal rights under the UCMJ and refer them to proper legal authorities for
guidance. </p>

maximum positive behavior change in the member receiving Article 15 punishment.

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Section 7F—Legal
Issues </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal111"><b class="calibre1">7.23. Evolution of the Military Justice System: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">7.23.1. The strength of the military depends on disciplined
service members ready to fight and win our Nation’s wars. Military justice
strengthens national security by providing commanders with an efficient and
effective means of maintaining good order and discipline. Furthermore, the
military justice system is a separate criminal justice system that does not
look to the civilian courts to dispose of disciplinary problems. As a separate
system, it allows the military to handle unique military crimes that civilian
courts would be unable to handle. </p>

<p class="msonormal112">7.23.2. In addition, a separate system enables the military
to address crimes committed by service members at worldwide locations in times
of war or peace. The military needs a justice system that goes wherever the
troops go to provide uniform treatment regardless of locale or circumstances.
No other judicial system in the U.S. provides such expansive coverage. As our
separate military justice system has evolved, this system has balanced two
basic interests: discipline (essential to warfighting capability) and justice
(a fair and impartial system essential to the morale of those serving their
country). </p>

<p class="msonormal11">7.23.3. While military justice can be traced to the time of
the Roman armies, the historical foundation for the U.S. military law and
criminal justice system is the British Articles of War. In fact, the first
codes predated the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence. These
codes were the Articles of War, applicable to the Army, and the Articles for
the Government of the Navy. Through World War I, these codes went through some
amendments and revisions but were substantially unchanged for more than 100
years. Throughout most of this time, the U.S. had a very small standing
military. Those who entered the military understood they were going to fall
under a different system of justice with unique procedures and punishments.
While some people had bad experiences with the military justice system during
this time, there was no overwhelming demand for change. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">7.23.4. This changed with World War II when the U.S. had
over 16 million men and women serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. Incredibly,
there were about 2 million courts-martial during hostilities. There were
approximately 80,000 general courts-martial during World War II. An average of
more than 60 general courts-martial convictions occurred per day for the
duration of the war. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">7.23.5. The soldiers and sailors of World War II were
regular citizens who volunteered or were drafted. Many of these citizens had
some very unpleasant experiences with the military justice system, which looked
quite different than today. The military justice system did not offer members
the protections afforded by the civilian court system, and many American
citizens disapproved of the way criminal laws were being applied in the
military. Following the war, many organizations studied and made proposals to
improve the military criminal legal system, and Congress conducted hearings on
the military justice system. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">7.23.6. After unification of the Armed Services under the
Department of Defense in 1947, Secretary James V. Forrestal, the first
Secretary of Defense, decided there should not be separate criminal law rules
for the different branches of Service. He desired a uniform code that would
apply to all services and address the abuses from World War II. His efforts set
the stage for a new uniform system of discipline. In 1950, Congress enacted the
UCMJ; this legislation is contained in Title10, United States Code, Sections
801 through 946. The UCMJ is the military’s criminal code applicable to all
branches of service. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">7.23.7. The UCMJ became effective in 1951 and provided
substantial procedural guarantees of an open and fair process that continues
today. The UCMJ required attorneys to represent the accused and the Government
in all general courtsmartial, prohibited improper command influence, and
created the appellate court system. Furthermore, the UCMJ established Air
Force, Army, Navy, and Coast Guard Boards of Review as the first level of
appeal in the military justice system and the U.S. Court of Military Appeals as
the second level of appeal. The Court of Military Appeals, composed of five
civilian judges, was perhaps the most revolutionary change that brought the
checks and balances of civilian control of the U.S. Armed Forces into the
military justice system. In October 1994, the Court of Military Appeals was
renamed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces to bring the name more
in line with our civilian counterparts. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">7.23.8. In addition to changing courts-martial processes and
procedures, the UCMJ provided a complete set of criminal laws. Moreover, the
UCMJ included many crimes punished under civilian law (for example, murder,
rape, drug use, larceny, drunk driving, etc.), and also punished other conduct
that affects good order and discipline. These unique military crimes include
such offenses as desertion, absence without leave, disrespect toward superiors,
failure to obey orders, dereliction of duty, wrongful disposition of military
property, drunk on duty, malingering, and conduct unbecoming an officer. The
UCMJ also included provisions punishing misbehavior before the enemy, improper
use of countersign, misbehavior of a sentinel, misconduct as a prisoner, aiding
the enemy, spying, and espionage. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">7.23.9. The UCMJ has been amended on a number of occasions.
For example, the Military Justice Act of 1968 created the position of military
judge, authorized trial by military judge alone, required an attorney to act as
defense counsel in all Special Court-Martials when the authorized punishment
included a bad conduct discharge, prohibited trial by Summary Court-Martial if
the accused objected, and changed service boards of review to courts of review.
</p>

<p class="msonormal6">7.23.10. The next significant change was the Military
Justice Act of 1983, which streamlined pretrial and post-trial procedures. The
act also provided for direct appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court from the Court
of Military Appeals in appropriate cases, without the need to first pursue an
appeal through the civilian appellate courts. The act also established a
separate punitive article (112a) for drug offenses. Today’s UCMJ reflects
centuries of experience in criminal law and military justice and guarantees
service members rights and privileges similar to and, in many cases, greater
than those enjoyed by civilians. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><b class="calibre1">7.24. Constitutional Underpinnings:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal6">Two provisions in the U.S. Constitution grant powers to the
legislative and executive branches providing the legal foundation for our
military justice system. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.24.1.<b class="calibre1"> Powers Granted to Congress. </b><i class="calibre3"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal23">The U.S. Constitution, Article I,
Section 8, provides that Congress is empowered to declare war; raise and
support armies; provide and maintain a navy; make rules for the government and
regulation of the land and naval forces; provide for calling forth the militia;
and organize, arm, and discipline the militias, and govern such part of them as
may be employed in the service of the U.S.. Congress is also responsible for
all laws deemed necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing
powers and all other powers vested by the U.S. Constitution in the U.S. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">Government. Congress has exercised their responsibilities
over military justice by enacting the UCMJ. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.24.2. <b class="calibre1">Authority Granted to the President.</b><i class="calibre3"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal16">The U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section 2, provides that
the President serves as commander in chief of the U.S. Armed Forces and of the
militia of the states (National Guard) when called to federal service. By
virtue of authority as commander in chief, the President has the power to issue
executive orders to govern the U.S. Armed Forces as long as these orders do not
conflict with any basic constitutional or statutory provisions. Article 36,
UCMJ, specifically authorizes the President to prescribe the procedures,
including rules of evidence, to be followed in courts-martial. In accordance
with Article 36, UCMJ, President Harry S. Truman established the Manual for
CourtsMartial in 1951 to implement the UCMJ. The Manual for Courts-Martial,
like the UCMJ, has undergone a number of revisions. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">7.25. Jurisdiction of Military Courts.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal6">Courts-martial jurisdiction is concerned with the question
of personal jurisdiction (Is the accused a person subject to the UCMJ?) and
subject-matter jurisdiction (Is the conduct prohibited by the UCMJ?). If the
answer is “yes” in both instances, then (and only then) does a court-martial
have jurisdiction to decide the case. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.25.1.<b class="calibre1"> Personal Jurisdiction: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.25.1.1. Personal jurisdiction involves status, that is,
the accused must possess the legal status of a service member or a person
otherwise subject to the UCMJ before personal jurisdiction can attach. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.25.1.2. Article 2, UCMJ, includes the following as
persons subject to court-martial jurisdiction: (1) members of a regular component
of the Armed Forces; including those awaiting discharge after expiration of
their terms of enlistment; (2) cadets, aviation cadets, and midshipmen; (3)
members of a Reserve component while on inactive duty training (but, in the
case of members of the Army National Guard and Air National Guard, only when in
Federal service); (4) retired members of a Regular component of the Armed
Forces who are entitled to pay; (5) persons in custody of the Armed Forces
serving a sentence imposed by court-martial; (6) prisoners of war in custody of
the Armed Forces; and (7) in time of declared war or a contingency operation,
persons serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.25.1.3. While the UCMJ previously provided for
jurisdiction over civilians serving with or accompanying an armed force in the
field in time of war, the U.S. court of appeals for the Armed Forces held that
the phrase “in time of war” meant a war formally declared by Congress. The U.S.
court of appeals for the Armed Forces decided this issue in reviewing a case (<i class="calibre3">U.S.
v. Averette</i>, 1970) in which a civilian had been tried during the Vietnam
Conflict for crimes committed within the combat zone. In the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007, Congress amended Article 2(a)(10) to
provide for UCMJ jurisdiction over civilians serving with or accompanying an
armed force in the field in time of declared war or a contingency operation. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.25.2.<b class="calibre1"> Subject-Matter Jurisdiction:  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.25.2.1. Courts-martial have the power to try any offense
under the code except when prohibited from doing so by the U.S. Constitution.
Courts-martial have exclusive jurisdiction when a purely military offense such
as desertion, failure to obey orders, or disrespect toward superiors is
involved. However, if the offense violates both the UCMJ and a civilian code,
concurrent jurisdiction may exist. For example, if an Regular Air Force
military member is caught shoplifting at an off-base merchant, the member can
be tried by court-martial for larceny in violation of Article 121, UCMJ, and
tried by a civilian court for a larceny offense recognized in the local
jurisdiction.  </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.25.2.2. The determination as to whether a military or a
civilian authority will try the member is normally made through consultation or
prior agreement between appropriate military authorities (ordinarily the staff
judge advocate) and appropriate civilian authorities. A member to be tried by
both a court-martial and a state court for the same act is constitutionally
permissible and a member who has been tried by a state court normally will not
be tried by court-martial for the same act. Only the Secretary of the Air Force
may approve such prosecutions, and only in the most unusual cases, when the
ends of justice and discipline can be met in no other way. </p>

<p class="msonormal113"> </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><b class="calibre1">7.26. Commander Involvement: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">7.26.1. Military commanders are responsible for maintaining
law and order in the communities over which they have authority and for
maintaining the discipline of the fighting force. Reports of crimes may come
from law enforcement or criminal investigative agencies, as well as reports
from supervisors or individual service members. One of the commander’s greatest
powers in the administration of military justice is the exercise of
discretion—to decide how misconduct committed by a member of his or her command
will be resolved. Each commander in the chain of command has independent, yet
overlapping, discretion to dispose of offenses within the limits of that
officer’s authority. A commander may dispose of the case by taking no action,
initiating administrative action against the member, offering the member
nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, or preferring court-martial
charges. Ordinarily, the immediate commander determines how to dispose of an
offense; however, a superior commander may withhold that authority. The staff
judge advocate is available to provide advice, but the commander ultimately
decides how to dispose of alleged misconduct. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">7.26.2. If a commander believes preferred charges should be
disposed by court-martial, the charges are forwarded to the convening
authority. Convening authorities are superior commanders or officials who
possess the authority to convene specific levels of courts-martial (wing and
numbered Air Force commanders in most cases). A convening authority convenes a
court-martial by issuing an order that charges previously preferred against an
accused will be tried by a specified court-martial. The convening authority
must personally make the decision to refer a case to trial; delegation of this
authority is not allowed. Charges may be referred to one of three types of
court-martial: summary, special, or general. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">7.27. Roles of the Parties in the Adversarial System.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal114">In courts-martial, both Government and the accused have legal
counsel. In addition, detailed defense counsel must include judge advocates,
graduates of an accredited law school, and members of the bar of a federal
court or the highest court of a state. Moreover, counsel must have
certification to perform duties by a service’s judge advocate general. The
trial counsel prosecutes in the name of the U.S. and presents evidence against
the accused. The defense counsel represents the accused and zealously seeks to
protect the accused’s rights. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.27.1.<b class="calibre1"> Trial Counsel: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.27.1.1. Trial counsel are similar to prosecutors in
civilian criminal trials. They represent the Government, and their objective is
justice, not merely securing a conviction. They zealously present evidence they
believe is admissible and seek to persuade the court that the accused committed
the alleged offenses. Trial counsel argues the inferences most strongly
supporting the charges. Highly experienced trial advocates (senior trial
counsel) are available to assist in the prosecution of particularly complex
courts-martial. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.27.1.2. Trial counsel also presents evidence and
arguments to address defenses raised on behalf of the accused. Trial counsel
may not ethically permit the continuance of the cause of action against the
accused knowing the charges are not supported by probable cause. Additionally,
trial counsel have an affirmative duty to disclose to the defense any evidence
that negates the accused’s guilt, mitigates the degree of guilt, or reasonably
tends to reduce the punishment of the accused. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.27.1.3. No person who has acted as accuser (one who prefers
charges), preliminary hearing officer, military judge, or court member in any
case may act later as trial counsel or assistant trial counsel in the same
case. No person who has acted for the prosecution may act later in the same
case for the defense, nor may any person who has acted for the defense act
later in the same case for the prosecution. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.27.2.<b class="calibre1"> Defense Counsel Representation. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">In a trial by court-martial, the accused is entitled to an
area defense counsel free of charge. The accused may also hire a civilian
lawyer at his or her own expense. An accused may request representation by a
particular military lawyer, and this officer will serve if he or she is
reasonably available. Defense counsel will zealously, within the bounds of the
law, guard the interests of the accused. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.27.3.<b class="calibre1"> Military Judge.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">A military trial judge presides over each open session of
the court-martial. Military trial judges are selected from highly qualified,
experienced judge advocates. Like defense counsel, military judges are assigned
to the Air Force Legal Operations Agency and do not report to anyone at base
level. No person is eligible to act as military judge in a case if he or she
was the accuser, is a witness for the prosecution, or has acted as preliminary
hearing officer or a counsel in the same case. The military judge of a
court-martial may not consult with the members of the court except in the presence
of the accused, trial counsel, and defense counsel, nor does he or she vote
with the members of the court. In noncapital cases, an accused may elect to be
tried by military judge alone. If such an election is made, the military judge
will make a finding of guilty or not guilty and, if guilty, determine the
sentence. </p>

<p class="msonormal38"> </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.27.4.<b class="calibre1"> Court Members: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.27.4.1. Members detailed to a court-martial are those
persons who, in the opinion of the convening authority, are best qualified for
the duty by reason of their age, education, training, experience, length of
service, and judicial temperament. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.27.4.2. Court panels are normally only composed of
officers senior to the accused. If the accused is enlisted and makes a timely
request that enlisted members be included on the court, the panel must consist
of at least one-third enlisted personnel. </p>

<p class="msonormal115">7.27.4.3. Court members determine whether
the accused has been proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and, if guilty,
adjudge (decide) a proper sentence based on the evidence and according to the
instructions of the military judge. No member may use grade or position to
influence another member. Voting is done by secret, written ballot. 7.27.5. <b class="calibre1">Ethical
Standards.</b><i class="calibre3"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Both trial and defense counsels are bound by the ethical
standards detailed in AFI 51-110, <i class="calibre3">Professional Responsibility Program</i>.
These standards cover a variety of matters. For example, counsel may not: </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.27.5.1. Present testimony known to be perjured or other
evidence known to be false. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.27.5.2. Intentionally misrepresent any piece of evidence
or matter of law. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.27.5.3. Unnecessarily delay or prolong the proceedings. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.27.5.4. Obstruct communications between prospective
witnesses and counsel for the other side. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.27.5.5. Use illegal means or condone the use of illegal
means to obtain evidence. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.27.5.6. Inject his or her own personal opinions or
beliefs into arguments to the court. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.27.5.7. Appeal to passion or prejudice. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.27.5.8. Attempt to influence court members by currying
favor or communicating privately with them.  </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">7.28. Post-trial Matters and Appellate Review: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.28.1. <b class="calibre1">Post-trial Matters.</b><i class="calibre3"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal14">The convening authority must act on every case. When taking
action on a case, the convening authority must consider the results of trial,
written recommendation of the staff judge advocate when required, and written
matters submitted by the accused and any victim named in a charge of which the
accused was convicted. Convening authorities may also consider the record of
trial, personnel records of the accused, and other matters they deem
appropriate. Pursuant to Article 60, UCMJ, the convening authority has limited
authority to disapprove the findings or sentence  </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.28.1.1. The convening authority may, but is not required
to, grant clemency on the findings. If the convening authority so chooses, some
clemency on findings may be given, subject to regulatory and statutory
limitations. The convening authority must provide a written explanation for
such action.  </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.28.1.2. Regardless of the offenses charged, the convening
authority may not disapprove, commute, or suspend in whole or in part an
adjudged sentence of confinement for more than 6 months or a punitive
discharge, unless exceptions apply. </p>

<p class="msonormal116">7.28.2.<b class="calibre1"> Appellate Review.</b>
Following the convening authority’s action is appellate review. The type of
appellate review depends upon the adjudged and approved sentence. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.28.2.1. The judge advocate general is the review
authority in general court-martial cases where the sentence does not include
death, dismissal, punitive discharge, or confinement for 1 year or more. The
judge advocate general may also elect to certify (refer) any case reviewed by
The Judge Advocate General’s office to the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals.
The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is an independent appellate judicial
body authorized by Congress and established by the judge advocate general
pursuant to direction of Title 10, United States Code, Section 866(a) (1994).
The court hears and decides appeals of Air Force court-martial convictions and
appeals during litigation. The Air Force court of criminal appeals appellate
judges are judge advocates appointed by the judge advocate general. </p>

<p class="msonormal117">7.28.2.2. Unless appellate review is waived by an
appellant, the Air Force court of criminal appeals automatically reviews all
cases involving a sentence that includes death, dismissal, a punitive discharge,
or confinement of 1 year or more. However, appellate review cannot be waived in
death penalty cases. In this forum, the appellant is provided a military
counsel (free of charge) who is an experienced trial advocate and a full-time
appellate counsel. Civilian appellate counsel may be retained at the
appellant’s own expense. The Government is represented by appellate Government
counsel. </p>

<p class="msonormal118">7.28.2.3. The Air Force court of criminal appeals must
consist of a panel of at least three military judges, reviews the case for
legal error, and determines if the record of trial supports both the findings
and sentence as approved by the convening authority. The Air Force court of
criminal appeals has the power to dismiss the case, change a finding of guilty
to one of not guilty or guilty to a lesser-included offense, reduce the
sentence, or order a rehearing. However, the appeal may not change a finding of
not guilty to one of guilty. The judge advocate general instructs convening
authorities to take action according to the court’s decisions. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.28.2.4. If the Air Force court of criminal appeals rules
against the appellant, he or she may request review by the U.S. court of
appeals for the Armed Forces. The U.S. court of appeals for the Armed Forces
must review all death penalty cases and any other case directed by The Judge
Advocate General of each service. Review in other cases is discretionary upon
petition of the appellant and upon good cause shown. Air Force appellate
defense counsel are appointed to represent the appellant before the U.S. court
of appeals for the Armed Forces. If an appellant’s case is reviewed and relief
is not granted by the U.S. court of appeals for the Armed Forces, the appellant
may petition the Supreme Court of the U.S. for further review. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.28.2.5. The Secretary of the Air Force automatically
reviews cases involving dismissal of an Air Force officer or cadet. Dismissal
is a punishment that punitively separates officers from the service. The
dismissal cannot be executed until the Secretary, or appointed designee,
approves the sentence. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.28.2.6. If the sentence extends to death, the individual
cannot be put to death until the President approves this part of the sentence.
The President has clemency powers over all courts-martial cases and may commute,
remit, or suspend any portion of the sentence. However, the President may not
suspend the part of the sentence that provides for death. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">7.29. Punitive Articles.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal6">This paragraph focuses on unique military offenses that do
not have a counterpart in civilian law. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.29.1. <b class="calibre1">Absence Offenses. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">For an armed force to be effective, they must have
sufficient members present to carry out the mission. One way this can be accomplished
is by deterring members from being absent without authority, whether the
absences are permanent or temporary. The circumstances under which the absence
occurs, as well as the intent of the accused, determines the severity of the
offense. Absence offenses include desertion and being absent without official
leave. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">7.29.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> Desertion: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.29.1.1.1. Article 85, UCMJ, may occur under the following
categories: (1) unauthorized absence with the intent to remain away
permanently; (2) quitting the unit or place of duty to avoid hazardous duty or
shirk important service; or (3) desertion by an officer before notice of
acceptance of resignation. More severe punishment is authorized if the
desertion is terminated by apprehension instead of a voluntary surrender or if
the desertion occurs in wartime. Desertion may be charged as a capital offense
(which authorizes the death penalty) during wartime. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.29.1.1.2. Absence with the specific intent to remain away
permanently is the most commonly charged type of desertion. The unauthorized
absence may be from the accused’s place of duty, unit, or organization. The
specific intent to remain away permanently may exist at the beginning of the
absence or may be formed at any time during the absence. Thus, when a member
leaves without permission, intending to return after a period of time, but
later decides never to return, the member has committed the offense of
desertion. However, proving intent is often difficult and may be shown by a
number of factors, including the length of the absence, use of an alias,
disposal of military identification and clothing items, concealment of military
status, distance from duty station, and the assumption of a permanent-type
civilian status or employment. The accused’s voluntary return to military
control is not a defense to desertion. The essential issue is whether the
accused, at any time, formed the intent to remain away permanently. </p>

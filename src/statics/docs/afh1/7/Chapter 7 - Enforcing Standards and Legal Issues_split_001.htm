<p class="msonormal119">.1.2.2. Proving a failure to go to an
appointed place of duty requires showing the accused actually knew he or she
was required to be at the appointed place of duty at the prescribed time. The
offense of going from the appointed place of duty<i class="calibre3"> </i>requires proof the
accused left his or her place of duty without proper authority, rather than
failing to report in the first place. The accused must have reported for and
begun the duty before leaving without proper authority. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.29.1.2.3. Absence from the unit, organization, or other
place of duty<i class="calibre3"> </i>is a common absent without official leave charge. The
authorized maximum punishment for this offense varies with the duration of the
absence.  </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.29.1.2.4. “Inability to return from leave” is a defense
if the accused encountered unforeseeable circumstances beyond his or her
control. For example, if Technical Sergeant Jane Doe’s authorized 10-day period
of leave expired on 1 December and she failed to report to her unit until 3
December, she would not be guilty of absent without official leave if she could
establish she was at a distant city and had purchased an airline ticket on a
flight that was cancelled due to a blizzard. Even though she has a defense, she
is not excused from calling her unit and requesting an extension of leave.
Inability would not be a defense where a military member took space-available
transportation to Europe while on leave and then claimed he or she was unable
to return on the date planned because he or she was unable to get
space-available transportation back when he or she had hoped. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.29.1.2.5. Other absences include abandoning watch or
guard and absence from the unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to
avoid maneuvers or field exercises. In addition, Article 87, UCMJ, provides
that missing a movement is an offense that applies when the member, through
neglect or design, misses the movement of a ship, aircraft, or unit. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.29.2. <b class="calibre1">False Official Statements.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal23">Article 107, UCMJ, covers both the
making and signing of false official statements and official documents. An
“official” statement or document is any statement or document made in the line
of duty. “In the line of duty” pertains to a matter within the jurisdiction of
any U.S. department or agency. Furthermore, you must be able prove that the
accused knew the statement or document was false and had a specific intent to
deceive. Examples include falsely identifying oneself to a base gate guard or
falsely listing a person as one’s dependent to gain base privileges. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">However, material gain is not an element of the offense. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.29.3. <b class="calibre1">General Article.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">The General Article (Article 134) is designed to address
unspecified offenses punishable because of their effect on the U.S. Armed
Forces. Article 134 generally provides for those offenses not specifically
mentioned elsewhere in the punitive articles of the UCMJ. A military member can
be punished under Article 134 for any and all disorders and neglects that are
prejudicial to good order and discipline in the Armed Forces, for conduct of a
nature to bring discredit upon the Armed Forces, and for crimes and offenses
not capital. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.29.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Disorders and Neglects Prejudicial to Good
Order and Discipline. </b>Article 134, UCMJ, seeks to protect the internal
operation of the U.S. Armed Forces. The issue is the effect of the accused’s
act on good order and discipline within the Armed Forces. The effect must be
reasonably direct and tangible. Disorders and neglects prejudicial to good
order and discipline include breach of customs of the service, fraternization,
impersonating an officer, disorderly conduct, gambling with a subordinate, and
incapacitating oneself for duty through prior indulgence in intoxicating
liquors. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">7.29.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Conduct of a Nature To Bring Discredit upon
the Armed Forces. </b>The concern here is the potential effect of the accused’s
act on the reputation of the U.S. Armed Forces (how the military is perceived
by the civilian sector). The conduct must tend to bring the Service into disrepute
or lower it in public esteem. Thus, violations of local civil law or foreign
law may be punished if they bring discredit upon the Armed Forces, such as
dishonorable failure to pay debts, indecent exposure, fleeing the scene of an
accident, bigamy, adultery, or pandering. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.29.3.3. <b class="calibre1">Crimes and Offenses Not Capital. </b>Acts or
omissions not chargeable under other articles of the UCMJ, but are crimes or
offenses under federal statutes, are charged under Article 134; for example,
counterfeiting. This crime is not specifically listed in the UCMJ but is still
a violation of federal law. Also, if a military member commits an act in an
area over which the military exercises exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction
with the state and no UCMJ article or federal law prohibits the act—only the
law of the state prohibits the act—then the Federal Assimilative Crimes Act
allows the member to be tried by a court-martial under Article 134. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.29.4. <b class="calibre1">Offenses Related to War.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">The UCMJ includes a number of offenses related to war.
These offenses include misbehaving before the enemy, aiding the enemy,
compelling surrender, improperly using countersigns, mishandling captured or
abandoned property, committing misconduct as a prisoner of war, and making
disloyal statements. Two especially egregious offenses related to war are
misbehavior before the enemy and misconduct as a prisoner of war. </p>

<p class="msonormal120">.4.1. <b class="calibre1">Misbehavior Before the Enemy. </b>Article
99, UCMJ, provides that running away before the enemy and cowardly conduct are
capital offenses punishable by death. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.29.4.1.1. The term “enemy” (as used in “running away
before the enemy”) includes both civilian and military organized forces of the
enemy in time of war and any opposing hostile bodies including rebellious mobs
or bands of renegades. The term is not restricted to the enemy Government or
their Armed Forces. If the misbehavior were caused by fear, the offense is
charged as “cowardly conduct,” rather than “running away.” Whether a person is
“before the enemy” is not a question of definite distance, but one of tactical
relation. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.29.4.1.2. The critical element in the offense of cowardly
conduct is fear that results in the abandonment or refusal to perform one’s
duty. Fear is a natural apprehension going into battle, and the mere display of
apprehension does not constitute this offense. Cowardice is misbehavior
motivated by fear. Genuine or extreme illness or other disability at the time
of the alleged misbehavior may be a defense. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.29.4.2. <b class="calibre1">Misconduct as a Prisoner of War. </b>Article
105, UCMJ, recognizes two types of offenses arising in prisoner of war
situations. One offense involves unauthorized conduct by an accused who secures
favorable treatment to the detriment of other prisoners. The other offense
prohibits maltreatment of a prisoner of war by a person in a position of
authority. The purpose of this article is to protect all persons held as
prisoners, whether military or civilian and regardless of their nationality. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.29.5.<b class="calibre1"> Insubordination:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.29.5.1. Insubordinate conduct may be expressed in many
different ways and toward many different persons in the military community.
Insubordination is judged both by the means used and the relative relationship
in the military hierarchy of the parties involved. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.29.5.2. Article 89, UCMJ, prohibits disrespectful acts or
language used toward a superior commissioned officer in his or her capacity as
an officer or as a private individual. Therefore, the superior commissioned
officer does not need to be in the execution of his or her office at the time
of the disrespectful behavior. However, it must be established that the accused
knew the person against whom the acts or words were directed was the accused’s
superior commissioned officer. Disrespect may include neglecting the customary
salute or showing a marked disdain, indifference, insolence, impertinence,
undue familiarity, or other rudeness toward the superior officer. Truth is no
defense. A superior commissioned officer is one who is superior in rank or
command. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.29.5.3. Article 91, UCMJ, similarly prohibits
insubordinate conduct toward a warrant officer, NCO, or petty officer. However,
unlike Article 89 violations, the insubordinate conduct must occur while the
individual being disrespected is in the execution of his or her duties. In
addition, Article 91 does not require a superior-subordinate relationship as an
element of the prescribed offense and can only be committed by enlisted members.
</p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.29.5.4. Another form of insubordination involves striking
or assaulting a superior officer. Article 90(1), UCMJ, prohibits assaults and
batteries against superior commissioned officers in the execution of their
duties. Article 91 prohibits similar conduct toward warrant officers, NCOs, and
petty officers. “In the execution of his office” includes any act or service
the officer is required or authorized to do by statute, regulation, orders, or
customs. An essential element is the accused’s knowledge that the person is a
superior officer or superior warrant officer, NCO, or petty officer. In time of
war, striking a superior commissioned officer can be a capital offense. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.29.6.<b class="calibre1"> Disobedience Offenses: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.29.6.1. <b class="calibre1">Disobeying a Superior Officer. </b>Article
90(2), UCMJ, prohibits the intentional or willful disobedience of the lawful
orders of a superior officer. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.29.6.2. <b class="calibre1">Failure to Obey Orders or Regulations. </b>Article
92, UCMJ, provides that members are subject to courtmartial if they: (1)
violate or fail to obey any lawful general order or regulation; (2) having
knowledge of a lawful order issued by a member of the Armed Forces, which is
their duty to obey, fail to obey the order; or (3) are derelict in the
performance of their duties. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.29.6.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Lawful General Order or Regulation. </b>This
term relates to general orders or regulations that are properly published by
the President, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of a military
department, an officer having General Court-Martial jurisdiction, a general
officer in command, or a commander superior to one of the former. (A squadron
commander does not have the authority to issue general orders.) Once issued, a
general order or regulation remains in effect even if a subsequent commander
assumes command. Knowledge of the order is not an element of the offense, and a
lack of knowledge is not a defense. Only those general orders or regulations
that are “punitive” are enforceable under Article 92(1). A punitive order or
regulation specifically states a member may be punished under the UCMJ if
violated. Regulations that only supply general guidelines or advice for
conducting military functions are not “punitive” and cannot be enforced under
Article 92(1). </p>

<p class="msonormal119">.6.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Other Lawful Orders or
Regulations. </b>This offense includes violations of written regulations that
are not general regulations. The key requirements are that the accused had a
duty to obey the order and had actual knowledge of the order. Such knowledge is
usually proven through circumstantial evidence. The accused cannot be convicted
of this offense merely because he or she should have known about the order.
Failure to obey a wing-level directive that prohibits overnight guests in the
dormitory is an example. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.29.6.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Dereliction of Duty. </b>Dereliction of duty
is comprised of three elements: (1) the accused had certain duties; (2) the
accused knew or reasonably should have known of the duties; and (3) the accused
was derelict in performing the duties, either by willfully failing to carry
them out or by carrying them out in a negligent or culpably inefficient manner.
“Willfully” means performing an act knowingly and purposely while specifically
intending the natural and probable consequences of the act. “Negligently” means
an act or omission of a person who is under a duty to use due care that
exhibits a lack of this degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would
have exercised under the same or similar circumstances. “Culpable inefficiency”
means an inefficiency for which there is no reasonable or just excuse. Merely
being inept in the performance of duty will not support a charge of dereliction
of duty, that is, officers or enlisted members cannot be punished for
inadequate performance if they make a good faith effort but fall short because
of a lack of aptitude or ability. Such performance may be grounds for
administrative demotion or administrative discharge, but is not a crime. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">7.29.7.<b class="calibre1"> Lawfulness of Orders: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.29.7.1. A lawful order must be: (1) reasonably in
furtherance of or connected to military needs; (2) specific as to time and
place and definite and certain in describing the thing or act to be done or
omitted; and (3) not otherwise contrary to established law or regulation. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">7.29.7.2. An order is in furtherance of, or connected to,
military needs when it involves activities reasonably necessary to accomplish a
military mission or to safeguard or promote the morale, discipline, and
usefulness of command. Such an order may interfere with private rights or
personal affairs, provided a valid military purpose exists. Furthermore, the
dictates of a person’s conscience, religion, or personal philosophy cannot
justify or excuse disobedience of an otherwise lawful order. An order requiring
the performance of a military duty or act may be inferred to be lawful and is
disobeyed at the peril of the subordinate. This inference does not apply to a
patently illegal order, such as one that directs the commission of a crime. An
accused cannot be punished for disobeying or failing to obey an unlawful order.
</p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">7.30. Conclusion:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal6">7.30.1. Air Force commanders must continuously evaluate
force readiness and organizational efficiency and effectiveness. The inspection
system provides the commander with a credible, independent assessment process
to measure the capability of assigned forces. Inspectors benchmark best
practices and exchange lessons learned and innovative methods.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">7.30.2. Criminal activity and intelligence operations
against the Air Force threaten national security. When Air Force personnel
commit criminal offenses, illegal activity occurs on an Air Force installation,
or Air Force security is breached or compromised, the Air Force must thoroughly
investigate criminal allegations and intelligence threats and refer them to
appropriate authorities for action.  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">7.30.3. The mission of the U.S. Air Force is to defend the
U.S. and protect its interests through air, space and cyberspace. Many aspects
of carrying out this job involve legal issues. This chapter provided
information on the Air Force Inspection System, the Inspector General
Complaints Program, individual standards, and punitive actions. All four areas
are necessary to enable the Air Force to fulfill our national security
obligations efficiently and effectively. </p>

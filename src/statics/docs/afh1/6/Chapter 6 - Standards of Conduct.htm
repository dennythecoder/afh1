<p class="msonormal"><b class="calibre1">Chapter 6 </b></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre1">STANDARDS OF CONDUCT </b></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 6A—Overview </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><!--[if !supportLists]--><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.1.<span class="calibre4">  </span></span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Introduction. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">In 1757, Lieutenant Colonel George Washington said
"discipline is the soul of an Army" and those words still hold true
in today's Air Force. Air Force standards must be uniformly known, consistently
applied and non-selectively enforced. Accountability is critically important to
good order and discipline of the force. To navigate the necessary course of
action and ensure mission accomplishment, a leader must be willing to use more
than one approach. Failure to ensure accountability will destroy the trust of the
American public, the very people living under the Constitution we swore to
support and defend, and who look to us, the members of their Nation's Air
Force, to embrace and live by the standards that are higher than those in the
society we serve. This chapter discusses the Law of Armed Conflict, Code of
Conduct, and general standards of conduct. Airmen must learn these standards
well enough not only to be able to follow them, but be able to articulate them
clearly to subordinates and enforce proper observation by other members. Used
in concert with information presented in Chapter 5 and Chapter 19, this chapter
covers issues vital to mission effectiveness, especially in light of the Air
Force global mission. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 6B—Law of Armed Conflict </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><!--[if !supportLists]--><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.2.<span class="calibre4">  </span></span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Law of Armed Conflict Defined. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">The Law of War, as defined by the Department of Defense
(DoD), is that part of international law that regulates the resort to armed
force; the conduct of hostilities and the protection of war victims in both
international and non-international armed conflict; belligerent occupation; and
the relationships between belligerent, neutral, and non-belligerent
States.<span class="calibre3">  </span>The law of war is often called
the Law of Armed Conflict.<span class="calibre3">  </span>While DoD
uses the term Law of War, most Air Force doctrine and publications continue to
use the term “Law of Armed Conflict”.<span class="calibre3"> 
</span>The Law of Armed Conflict arises from civilized nations’ humanitarian
desire to lessen the effects of conflicts. Law of Armed Conflict protects
combatants, noncombatants and civilians from unnecessary suffering, and
provides certain fundamental protections for persons who fall into the hands of
the enemy, particularly prisoners of war, civilians, and military wounded,
sick, and shipwrecked. The law also tries to keep conflicts from degenerating
into savagery and brutality, thereby helping to restore peace.<span class="calibre5"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><!--[if !supportLists]--><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.3.<span class="calibre4">  </span></span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Law of Armed Conflict Policy. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3">DoDD</span> 2311.01E, <i class="calibre2">Department of Defense Law of War Program</i>,
requires each military department to design a program that ensures Law of Armed
Conflict observance, prevents violations, ensures prompt reporting of alleged
violations, appropriately trains all forces, and completes a legal review of
new weapons. Law of Armed Conflict training is an obligation of the U.S. under
provisions of the 1949 Geneva Conventions other law of war treaties and
customary international law. AFI 51-401,<i class="calibre2">
Training and Reporting to Ensure Compliance with the Law of Armed Conflict</i>,
requires that all Air Force personnel receive instruction on the principles and
rules of the Law of Armed Conflict commensurate with each member’s duties and
responsibilities. The training is of a general nature; however, certain groups
such as aircrews, medical personnel, and security forces receive additional,
specialized training to address the unique situations they may encounter. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><!--[if !supportLists]--><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.4.<span class="calibre4">  </span></span></span></b><b class="calibre1">International and Domestic Law.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal6">The Law of Armed Conflict is embodied in both customary
international law and treaties. Customary international law, reflected in
practices nations have come to accept as legally binding, establishes many of
the oldest rules that govern the conduct of military operations in armed
conflict. Article VI of the U.S. Constitution states that treaty obligations of
the </p>

<p class="msonormal5">U.S. are the “supreme law of the land,” and the U.S. Supreme
Court has held that U.S. international legal obligations, to include custom, is
part of U.S. law. This means that treaties and international agreements with
the U.S. enjoy equal status to laws passed by Congress and signed by the
President. Therefore, all <span class="calibre3">persons</span> subject to U.S. law
must observe the U.S. Law of Armed Conflict obligations. Military personnel,
civilians, and contractors authorized to accompany the armed forces in combat
must consider the Law of Armed Conflict to plan and execute operations and must
obey Law of Armed Conflict in combat. Those who commit violations may be
criminally liable and court-martialed under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.5.</b> <b class="calibre1">Principles. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">Five important Law of Armed Conflict principles govern armed
conflict: military necessity, distinction, proportionality, humanity, and
honor. </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><span class="calibre3"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.5.1. <b class="calibre1">Military
Necessity: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.5.1.1.<span class="calibre4">    </span></span></span>Military
necessity is the principle that justifies the use of all measures needed to
defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible that are not prohibited
by the law of war.<span class="calibre3">   </span></p>

<p class="msonormal10"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.5.1.2.<span class="calibre4">    </span></span></span>Attacks
must be limited to military objectives. Certain classes of persons are military
objectives and may be made the object of attack. These classes of persons
include: combatants, or unprivileged belligerents; and civilians taking a
direct part in hostilities. Military objectives, insofar as objects are
concerned, include any objects which by its nature, location, purpose, or use
make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial
destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the
time, offer a definite military advantage. Examples include tanks, military
aircraft, bases, supplies, lines of communications, and headquarters. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.5.1.3.<span class="calibre4">    </span></span></span>Military
necessity does not authorize all military action and destruction. Under no
circumstances may military necessity authorize actions specifically prohibited
by the law of war, such as the murder of prisoners of war, ill treatment of
prisoners of war or internees, the taking of hostages, or execution or reprisal
against a person or object specifically protected from reprisal. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.5.2.<span class="calibre4">  </span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Humanity:<span class="calibre3"> 
</span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">Although military necessity justifies certain
actions necessary to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible,
military necessity cannot justify actions not necessary to achieve this
purpose, such as cruelty or wanton violence.<span class="calibre3"> 
</span>Moreover, once a military purpose has been achieved, inflicting more
suffering is unnecessary and should be avoided. For example, if an enemy
combatant has been placed hors de combat (e.g., incapacitated by being severely
wounded or captured), no military purpose is served by continuing to attack him
or her. Thus, the principle of humanity forbids making enemy combatants who
have been placed hors de combat the object of attack. Humanity animates certain
law of war rules, including prohibitions on weapons that are calculated to
cause superfluous injury; and prohibitions on weapons that are inherently
indiscriminate. For example, the 1907 Hague Convention prohibits the use of
poison or poisoned weapons in combat. Also, indiscriminate chemical,
biological, and bacterial weapons are banned by treaties because they cause
unnecessary suffering. However, using rifles to shoot prisoners of war,
strafing civilians, firing on shipwrecked mariners or downed aircrews are
lawful weapons that may be used unlawfully. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.5.3.<span class="calibre4">  </span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Distinction: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">6.5.3.1. This principle
imposes a requirement to distinguish (also termed "discriminate")
between the civilian population (or individual civilians not taking a direct
part in the hostilities) and combatant forces when engaged in military
operations. Military force may be directed only against military objects or
objectives, and not against civilian objects. </p>

<p class="msonormal13"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.5.3.1.1.<span class="calibre4">          
</span></span></span>Civilian objects are protected from attack and
include such objects as places of worship, schools, hospitals, and dwellings. </p>

<p class="msonormal14"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.5.3.1.2.<span class="calibre4">          
</span></span></span>Civilian objects can lose their protected status
if they are used to make an effective contribution to military action.<span class="calibre3">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal10">6.5.3.2. A defender has an obligation to
separate civilians and civilian objects (either in the defender’s country or in
an occupied area) from military targets. Employment of voluntary or involuntary
human shields to protect military objectives or individual military units or
personnel is a fundamental violation of the law of war principle of
distinction.<span class="calibre3">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.5.4. <b class="calibre1">Proportionality:</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal10"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.5.4.1.<span class="calibre4">    </span></span></span>Proportionality
may be defined as the principle that even where one is justified in acting, one
must not act in way that is unreasonable or excessive.<span class="calibre3">  </span>Proportionality generally weighs the
justification for acting against the expected harms to determine whether the
latter are disproportionate in comparison to the former. In war, incidental damage
to the civilian population and civilian objects is unfortunate and tragic, but
inevitable. Thus, applying the proportionality rule in conducting attacks does
not require that no incidental damage result from attacks. Rather, this rule
obliges persons to refrain from attacking where the expected harm incidental to
such attacks would be excessive in relation to the military advantage
anticipated to be gained. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.5.4.2.<span class="calibre4">    </span></span></span>Proportionality
most often refers to the standard applicable to persons conducting attacks.
Proportionality considerations, however, may also be understood to apply to the
party subject to attack, which must take feasible precautions to reduce the
risk of incidental harm. Proportionality also plays a role in assessing whether
weapons are prohibited because they are calculated to cause unnecessary
suffering. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.5.4.3.<span class="calibre4">    </span></span></span>Damages
and casualties must be consistent with mission accomplishment and allowable
risk to the attacking force (for example, the attacker need not expose its
forces to extraordinary risks simply to avoid or minimize civilian losses). </p>

<p class="msonormal5">6.5.5. <b class="calibre1">Honor: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.5.5.1.<span class="calibre4">    </span></span></span>Honor
requires a certain amount of fairness in offense and defense. In requiring a
certain amount of fairness in offense and defense, honor reflects the principle
that parties to a conflict must accept that certain limits exist on their ability
to conduct hostilities. Honor also forbids resort to means, expedients, or
conduct that would constitute a breach of trust with the enemy.<span class="calibre3">   </span></p>

<p class="msonormal10"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.5.5.2.<span class="calibre4">    </span></span></span>For
example, enemies must deal with one another in good faith in their non-hostile
relations. And even in the conduct of hostilities, good faith prohibits: (1)
killing or wounding enemy persons by resort to perfidy; (2) misusing certain
signs; (3) fighting in the enemy’s uniform; (4) feigning non-hostile relations
in order to seek a military advantage; and (5) compelling nationals of a
hostile party to take part in the operations of war directed against their own
country. Honor, however, does not forbid parties from using ruses and other
lawful deceptions against which the enemy ought to take measures to protect
itself. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.6. The Protection of
War Victims and Classes of Persons.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Some of the most important Law of Armed
Conflict rules come from the Geneva Conventions of 1949. The Geneva Conventions
consist of four separate international treaties that aim to protect all persons
taking no active part in hostilities, including members of armed forces who
have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds,
detention, or any other cause. These treaties also seek to protect civilians
and private property. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.6.1.<b class="calibre1"> Categories of
Personnel: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">6.6.1.1. <b class="calibre1">Geneva
Convention Distinctions. </b>The Geneva Conventions distinguish between
combatants, noncombatants, and civilians. </p>

<p class="msonormal13"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.6.1.1.1.<span class="calibre4">          
</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Combatants.</b>
Three classes of persons qualify as “lawful” or “privileged” combatants: (1)
members of the armed forces of a State that is a party to a conflict, aside
from certain categories of medical and religious personnel; (2) under certain
conditions, members of militia or volunteer corps that are not part of the
armed forces of a State, but belong to a State; and (3) inhabitants of an area
who participate in a kind of popular uprising to defend against foreign
invaders, known as a <span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre2">levée</i></span><i class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">en</span> masse</i>. A
combatant is commanded by a person responsible for subordinates; wears fixed
distinctive emblems recognizable at a distance, such as uniforms; carries arms
openly; and conducts his or her combat operations according to Law of Armed
Conflict. Lawful or privileged combatants are entitled to Prisoner of war
Status if captured and cannot be prosecuted for their lawful conduct in an
armed conflict. </p>

<p class="msonormal13"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.6.1.1.2.<span class="calibre4">          
</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Noncombatants.</b>
Noncombatants include certain military personnel who are members of the Armed
Forces not authorized to engage in combatant activities, such as permanent
medical personnel and chaplains. Noncombatants must be respected and protected
and may not be made the object of attack. </p>

<p class="msonormal17"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.6.1.1.3.<span class="calibre4">          
</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Civilians.</b>
Civilians are also protected persons and may not be made the object of direct
attack. They may, however, suffer injury or death incident to a direct attack
on a military objective without such an attack violating Law of Armed Conflict,
if such attack is on a lawful target by lawful means. With limited exceptions,
the Law of Armed Conflict does not authorize civilians to take an active or
direct part in hostilities. Civilians who take a direct part in hostilities
without authority to do so are unprivileged belligerent and can be made the
object of attacked when participating in hostiles. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">6.6.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Unprivileged
Belligerents: A</b><span class="calibre6"> </span><b class="calibre1">Distinction
Not Made by the Geneva Conventions.</b> The term unprivileged belligerent is
not used in the Geneva Conventions. The term “unprivileged belligerent”, as
defined in the DoD Manual on the Law of War, includes “lawful combatants who
have forfeited the privileges of combatant status by engaging in spying or
sabotage, and private persons who have forfeited one or more of the protections
of civilian status by engaging in hostilities.” An unprivileged belligerent is
an individual who is not authorized by a state that is party to a conflict to
take part in hostilities but does so anyway. For example, civilians who plant
improvised explosive devices are unprivileged belligerents.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">6.6.2. <b class="calibre1">Undetermined
Status.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal19">Should doubt exist as to whether a captured individual is a
lawful combatant, noncombatant, or an unprivileged belligerent, the individual
will receive the protections of the Geneva Prisoner of War Convention until
status is determined. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.7. Military
Objectives. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">The Law of Armed Conflict governs the conduct of aerial
warfare. The principle of military necessity authorizes aerial attacks on
combatants and other lawful military objectives. Military objectives are
limited to those objects or installations that by their own nature, location,
purpose, or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose
total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization in the circumstances
existing at the time offer a definite military advantage. </p>

<p class="msonormal18"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre3">6.7.1.<span class="calibre4">                    
</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Protection
of Civilians and Civilian Objects.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Law of Armed Conflict protects civilian
populations. Military attacks against cities, towns, or villages not justified
by military necessity are forbidden. Attacking civilians for the sole purpose
of terrorizing them is also prohibited. Although civilians may not be made the
object of a direct attack, Law of Armed Conflict recognizes that a military
objective need not be spared because its destruction may cause collateral
damage that results in the unintended death or injury to civilians or damage to
their property. Commanders and their planners must take into consideration the
extent of damage to civilian objects and casualties anticipated as a result of
an attack on a military objective and seek to avoid or minimize civilian casualties
and destruction. Anticipated damage to civilian objects and civilian casualties
must not be disproportionate to the military advantage sought. Judge advocate,
intelligence, and operations personnel play a critical role in determining the

<p class="msonormal35">6.14.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Explanation:</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal13">6.14.3.1.1. An Armed Forces member’s duty to
continue to resist enemy exploitation by all means available is not lessened by
the misfortune of capture. Contrary to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, enemies
U.S. forces have engaged since 1949 have treated the prisoner of war compound
as an extension of the battlefield. The prisoner of war must be prepared for
this. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">6.14.3.1.2. Enemies have used a variety of
tactics to exploit prisoners of war for propaganda purposes or to obtain
military information, in spite of Geneva Conventions prohibition. Physical and
mental harassment, general mistreatment, torture, medical neglect, and
political indoctrination have all been used, and the enemy has tried to tempt
prisoners of war to accept special favors or privileges in return for
statements or information, or for a pledge by the prisoner of war not to
attempt escape. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">6.14.3.1.3. A prisoner of war must not seek
special privileges or accept special favors at the expense of fellow prisoners
of war. Under the guidance and supervision of the senior military person, the
prisoner of war must be prepared to take advantage of escape opportunities. In
communal detention, the welfare of the prisoners of war who remain behind must
be considered. Additionally, prisoners of war should not sign or enter into a
parole agreement. Parole agreements are promises the prisoners of war make to
the captor to fulfill stated conditions, such as not to bear arms, in exchange
for special privileges, such as release or lessened restraint. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">6.14.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Training.</b> Members should understand that captivity involves
continuous control by a captor who may attempt to use the prisoner of war as a
source of information for political purposes or as a potential subject for
political indoctrination. Members must familiarize themselves with prisoner of
war and captor rights and obligations under the Geneva Conventions,
understanding that some captors have accused prisoners of war of being war
criminals simply because they waged war against them. Continued efforts to
escape are critical because a successful escape causes the enemy to divert
forces that may otherwise be fighting, provides the U.S. valuable information
about the enemy and other prisoners of war, and serves as a positive example to
all members of the Armed Forces. 6.14.4. <b class="calibre1">ARTICLE

<p class="msonormal36"><i class="calibre2">If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners.

<p class="msonormal13">6.14.4.1. <b class="calibre1">Explanation<i class="calibre2">.</i></b> Officers and
NCOs continue to carry out their responsibilities and exercise authority in

war, is despicable and expressly forbidden. Prisoners of war must avoid helping
the enemy identify fellow prisoners of war who may have valuable knowledge to
the enemy. Strong leadership is essential to discipline. Without discipline,
camp organization, resistance, and even survival may be impossible. Personal
hygiene, camp sanitation, and care of the sick and wounded are imperative.
Wherever located, prisoners of war must organize in a military manner under the
senior military prisoner of war, regardless of military service. If the senior
prisoner of war is incapacitated or otherwise unable to act, the next senior
prisoner of war assumes command. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">6.14.4.2. <b class="calibre1">Training.</b> Members must be trained to understand and accept
leadership from those in command and abide by the decisions of the senior
prisoner of war, regardless of military service. Failing to do so may result in
legal proceedings under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Additionally, a
prisoner of war who voluntarily informs or collaborates with the captor is a
traitor to the U.S. and fellow prisoners of war and, after repatriation, is
subject to punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Service
members must be familiar with the principles of hygiene, sanitation, health
maintenance, first aid, physical conditioning, and food utilization. </p>

give name, rank, service number, and date of birth. I will evade answering

<p class="msonormal35">6.14.5.1.<b class="calibre1"> Explanation:
</b></p>

<p class="msonormal13">6.14.5.1.1. When questioned, a prisoner of
war is required by the Geneva Conventions, and permitted by the Uniform Code of
Military Justice, to give name, rank, service number, and date of birth. Under
the Geneva Conventions, the enemy has no right to try to force a prisoner of
war to provide any additional information. However, it is unrealistic to expect
a prisoner of war to remain confined for years reciting only name, rank,
service number, and date of birth. Many prisoner of war camp situations exist
in which certain types of conversation with the enemy are permitted. For
example, a prisoner of war is allowed, but not required by the Code of Conduct,
the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or the Geneva Conventions, to fill out a
Geneva Conventions capture card, to write letters home, and to communicate with
captors on matters of health and welfare. The senior prisoner of war is
required to represent prisoners of war in matters of camp administration, health,
welfare, and grievances. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">6.14.5.1.2. A prisoner of war must resist,
avoid, or evade, even when physically and mentally coerced, all enemy efforts
to secure statements or actions that may further the enemy’s cause. Examples of
statements or actions prisoners of war should resist include giving oral or
written confessions, answering questionnaires, providing personal history
statements, and making propaganda recordings and broadcast appeals to other
prisoners of war to comply with improper captor demands. Additionally,
prisoners of war should resist appealing for U.S. surrender or parole, engaging
in self-criticism, or providing oral or written statements or communication
that are harmful to the U.S., its allies, the Armed Forces, or other prisoners
of war. Experience has shown that, although enemy interrogation sessions may be
harsh and cruel, a prisoner of war can usually resist if there is a will to
resist. The best way for a prisoner of war to keep faith with the U.S., fellow
prisoners of war, and him or herself is to provide the enemy with as little
information as possible. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">6.14.5.2.<b class="calibre1"> Training<i class="calibre2">.</i></b> Service
members familiarize themselves with the various aspects of interrogation,
including phases, procedures, and methods and techniques, as well as the
interrogator’s goals, strengths, and weaknesses. Members should avoid
disclosing information by such techniques as claiming inability to furnish
information because of previous orders, poor memory, ignorance, or lack of
comprehension. They should understand that, short of death, a prisoner of war
may prevent a skilled enemy interrogator, using all available psychological and
physical methods of coercion, from obtaining some degree of compliance by the
prisoner of war is unlikely. However, the prisoner of war must recover as
quickly as possible and resist successive efforts to the utmost.<span class="calibre3">  </span></p>

including prisoners of war family members. Military members must ensure their
personal affairs and family matters are up to date at all times. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.15. Detention of
U.S. Military Personnel in Operations Other than War: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal38">6.15.1. <b class="calibre1">Policy<i class="calibre2">.</i> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">U.S. military personnel isolated from U.S.
control are still required to do everything in their power to follow DoD and
Air Force policy and survive with honor. <span class="calibre3">DoDI</span>
1300.21, <i class="calibre2">Code of Conduct (<span class="calibre3">CoC</span>) Training and Education, </i>Enclosure 3, provides
guidance to military members who find themselves isolated during operations
other than war or in a situation not addressed specifically in the Code of
Conduct. All military departments establish procedures to ensure U.S. military
personnel are familiar with the guidance in this publication. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.15.2. <b class="calibre1">Rationale.</b><span class="calibre3">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal32">Because of their wide range of activities,
U.S. military personnel are subject to detention by unfriendly governments or
captivity by terrorist groups. When a hostile government or terrorist group
detains or captures U.S. military personnel, the captor is often attempting to
exploit both the individual and the U.S. Government for its own purposes. As
history has shown, exploitation can take many forms, such as hostage
confessions to crimes never committed, international news media exploitation,
and substantial ransom demands, all of which can lead to increased credibility
and support for the detainer. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.15.3.<b class="calibre1">
Responsibility: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">6.15.3.1.<i class="calibre2">
</i>U.S. military personnel detained by unfriendly governments or held hostage
by a terrorist group must do everything in their power to survive with honor.
Furthermore, whether U.S. military personnel are detained or held hostage, they
can be sure the U.S. Government will make every effort to obtain their release.
To best survive the situation, military personnel must maintain faith in their
country, in fellow detainees or captives and, most importantly, in themselves.
In any group captivity situation, military captives must organize, to the
fullest extent possible, under the senior military member present. If civilians
are part of the group, they should be encouraged to participate. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">6.15.3.2. U.S. military personnel must make
every reasonable effort to prevent captors from exploiting them and the U.S.
Government. If exploitation cannot be prevented, military members must attempt
to limit it. If detainees convince their captors of their low propaganda value,
the captors may seek a quick end to the situation. When a detention or hostage
situation ends, military members who can honestly say they did their utmost to
resist exploitation will have upheld DoD policy, the founding principles of the
U.S., and the highest traditions of military service. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.15.4. <b class="calibre1">Military
Bearing and Courtesy.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal33">U.S. military personnel shall maintain their
military bearing, regardless of the type of detention or captivity, or
harshness of treatment. They should make every effort to remain calm,
courteous, and project personal dignity. That is particularly important during
the process of capture and the early stages of internment when the captors may
be uncertain of their control over the captives. Discourteous, nonmilitary
behavior seldom serves the long-term interest of a detainee or hostage and
often results in unnecessary punishment that serves no useful purpose.<span class="calibre6"> </span>Such
behavior often results in punishment that serves no useful purpose. In some
situations, such behavior may jeopardize survival and severely complicate
efforts to gain release of the detainee or hostage. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.15.5.<b class="calibre1"> Guidance for
Detention by Governments: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">6.15.5.1. Detainees in the custody of a
hostile government, regardless of the circumstances that resulted in the
detention, are subject to the laws of that government. Detainees must maintain
military bearing and avoid aggressive, combative, or illegal behavior that may
complicate their situation, legal status, or efforts to negotiate a rapid
release. As American citizens, detainees should ask immediately and continually
to see U.S. embassy personnel or a representative of an allied or neutral
government. U.S. military personnel who become lost or isolated in a hostile
foreign country during operations other than war will not act as combatants
during evasion attempts. During operations other than war, there is no
protection afforded under the Geneva Convention. The civil laws of that country
apply. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">6.15.5.2. A detainer’s goal may be maximum
political exploitation. Therefore, detained U.S. military personnel must be
cautious in all they say and do. In addition to asking for a U.S. representative,
detainees should provide name, rank, service number, date of birth, and the
innocent circumstances leading to their detention. They should limit further
discussions to health and welfare matters, conditions of their fellow
detainees, and going home. </p>

<p class="msonormal39">6.15.5.3. Detainees
should avoid signing any document or making any statement, oral or otherwise.
If forced, they must provide as little information as possible and then
continue to resist. Detainees are not likely to earn their release by
cooperation. Rather, release may be gained by resisting, thereby reducing the
value of the detainee. U.S. military detainees should not refuse release,
unless doing so requires them to compromise their honor or cause damage to the
U.S. Government or its allies. Escape attempts must be made only after
carefully considering the risk of violence, chance of success, and detrimental
effects on detainees remaining behind. Jailbreak in most countries is a crime. Escape
attempts can provide the detainer further justification to hold the individual.
</p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.15.6.<b class="calibre1"> Terrorist
Hostage: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">6.15.6.1. Capture by terrorists is generally
the least predictable and structured form of operations, other than war
captivity. Capture can range from a spontaneous kidnapping to a carefully
planned hijacking. In either situation, hostages play an important role in
determining their own fate because terrorists rarely expect to receive rewards
for providing good treatment or releasing victims unharmed. U.S. military
members should assume their captors are genuine terrorists when unclear if they
are surrogates of a government.<span class="calibre3">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal40">6.15.6.2. A terrorist hostage situation is
more volatile than a government detention, so members must take steps to lessen
the chance of a terrorist indiscriminately killing hostages. In such a
situation, DoD policy accepts and promotes efforts to establish rapport between
U.S. hostages and the terrorists in order to establish themselves as people in
the terrorist’s mind, rather than a stereotypical symbol of a country the
terrorist may hate. DoD policy recommends U.S. personnel talk to terrorists
about <span class="calibre3">nonsubstantive</span> subjects such as family, sports,
and hobbies. They should stay away from topics that could inflame terrorist
sensibilities, such as their cause, politics, or religion. Listening can be
vitally important when survival is at stake. Members should take an active role
in the conversation, but should not argue, patronize, or debate issues with the
captors. They should try to reduce tension and make it as hard as possible for
terrorists to identify U.S. personnel as troublemakers, which may mark them for
murder. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 6D—Everyday Conduct </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.16. Overview. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">The importance of the Air Force mission and responsibility
to the nation requires members adhere to higher standards than nonmilitary
members. Every person is accountable for his or her own actions on duty and
off. Supervisors must hold subordinates accountable and take corrective action
if they do not fulfill their responsibilities. Members must remember and
reflect the Air Force Core Values—Integrity First, Service Before Self, and
Excellence in All We Do—in everything they do.<span class="calibre3"> 
</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.17.</b> <b class="calibre1">Policy.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3">DoDD</span> 5500.07, <i class="calibre2">Standards of Conduct,</i> DoD 5500.07-R, <i class="calibre2">The Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), and </i>AFI 1-1, <i class="calibre2">Air Force Standards</i> provide guidance to
Air Force personnel on standards of conduct. Military members who violate the
punitive provisions may be prosecuted under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice. Civilian violations may result in disciplinary action without regard
to the issue of criminal liability. Military members and civilian employees who
violate these standards, even if such violations do not constitute criminal
misconduct, are subject to administrative actions, such as reprimands. Contact
the base legal office for assistance. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.18. Ethical Values.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal5">Ethics are standards of conduct based on values. Values are
core beliefs, such as duty, honor, and integrity that motivate attitudes and
actions. Not all values are ethical values (integrity is; happiness is not).
Ethical values relate to what is right and wrong and thus take precedence over <span class="calibre3">nonethical</span> values when making ethical decisions. DoD
employees who make decisions as part of their official duties should carefully
consider ethical values. Primary ethical values include: </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.18.1. <b class="calibre1">Honesty.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Being truthful, straightforward, and candid
are aspects of honesty: </p>

<p class="msonormal10">6.18.1.1. Truthfulness is required.
Deceptions are usually easily uncovered. Lies erode credibility and undermine
public confidence. Untruths told for seemingly altruistic reasons (to prevent
hurt feelings, to promote good will, etc.) are nonetheless resented by the
recipients. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">6.18.1.2. Straightforwardness adds frankness
to truthfulness and is usually necessary to promote public confidence and to
ensure effective, efficient conduct of operations. Truths presented in such a
way as to lead recipients to confusion, misinterpretation, or inaccurate
conclusions are not productive. Such indirect deceptions can promote ill will
and erode openness, especially when there is an expectation of frankness. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">6.18.1.3. Candor is the forthright offering
of unrequested information. This ethical value is necessary according to the
gravity of the situation and the nature of the relationships. Candor is
required when a reasonable person would feel betrayed if the information was
withheld. In some circumstances, silence is dishonest; yet in other
circumstances, disclosing information would be wrong and perhaps unlawful. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.18.2. <b class="calibre1">Integrity.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal10">Being faithful to one’s convictions is part
of integrity. Following principles, acting with honor, maintaining independent
judgment, and performing duties with impartiality help to maintain integrity
and avoid conflicts of interest and hypocrisy. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.18.3. <b class="calibre1">Loyalty.</b><span class="calibre3">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal10">Fidelity, faithfulness, allegiance, and
devotion are all synonyms for loyalty. Loyalty is the bond that holds the
Nation and the U.S. Government together and the balm against dissension and
conflict. This ethical value is not blind obedience or unquestioning acceptance
of the status quo. Loyalty requires careful balance among various interests,
values, and institutions in the interest of harmony and cohesion. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.18.4. <b class="calibre1">Accountability<i class="calibre2">.</i> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">DoD employees are required to accept
responsibility for their decisions and the resulting consequences. This
includes avoiding even the appearance of impropriety. Accountability promotes
careful, well-thought-out decisions, and limits thoughtless action. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.18.5. <b class="calibre1">Fairness<i class="calibre2">.</i></b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Open mindedness and impartiality are
important aspects of fairness. DoD employees must be committed to justice in
the performance of their official duties. Decisions must not be arbitrary,
capricious, or biased. Individuals must be treated equally and with tolerance. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">6.18.6. <b class="calibre1">Caring<i class="calibre2">.</i></b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Compassion is an essential element of good
government. Courtesy and kindness, both to those we serve and to those with
whom we work, help to ensure individuals are not treated solely as a means to
an end. Caring for others is the counterbalance against the temptation to
pursue the mission at any cost. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">6.18.7. <b class="calibre1">Respect<i class="calibre2">.</i></b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">To treat people with dignity, to honor
privacy, and to allow self-determination are critical in a government of
diverse people. Lack of respect leads to a breakdown of loyalty and honesty
within a government and brings chaos to the international community. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.18.8. <b class="calibre1">Promise-Keeping<i class="calibre2">.</i></b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">No government can function for long if its
commitments are not kept. DoD employees are obligated to keep their promises in
order to promote trust and cooperation. Because of the importance of promise-keeping,
DoD employees must only make commitments within their authority. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.18.9. <b class="calibre1">Responsible
Citizenship<i class="calibre2">.</i></b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Responsible citizenship is the duty of every
citizen, especially DoD employees, to exercise discretion. Public servants are
expected to engage (employ) personal judgment in the performance of official
duties within the limits of their authority so that the will of the people is
respected according to democratic principles. Justice must be pursued and
injustice must be challenged through accepted means. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.18.10. <b class="calibre1">Pursuit of
Excellence<i class="calibre2">.</i></b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">In public service, competence is only the
starting point. DoD employees are expected to set an example of superior
diligence and commitment. They are expected to strive beyond mediocrity. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.19.</b> <b class="calibre1">Professional and Unprofessional
Relationships. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">Professional relationships are essential to the effective
operation of all organizations, military and civilian, but the nature of the
military mission requires absolute confidence in command and an unhesitating
adherence to orders that may result in inconvenience, hardships, injury, or
death. While personal relationships between Air Force members are normally
matters of individual choice and judgment, they become matters of official
concern when they adversely affect or have the reasonable potential to
adversely affect the Air Force by eroding morale, good order, discipline,
respect for authority, unit cohesion, or mission accomplishment. AFI 36-2909, <i class="calibre2">Professional and Unprofessional
Relationships,</i> establishes responsibilities for maintaining professional
relationships. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.19.1. <b class="calibre1">Professional
Relationships.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Professional relationships contribute to the
effective operation of the Air Force. The Air Force encourages personnel to
communicate freely with their superiors regarding their careers and
performance, duties, and missions. This type of communication enhances morale
and discipline and improves the operational environment while at the same time
preserving proper respect for authority and focus on the mission. Participation
by members of all grades in organizational activities, such as base intramural,
<span class="calibre3">interservice</span>, and <span class="calibre3">intraservice</span>
athletic competitions, unit-sponsored events, religious activities, community
welfare projects, and youth programs, enhances morale and contributes to unit
cohesion. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">6.19.2.<b class="calibre1"> Unprofessional Relationships. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">Unprofessional
relationships, whether pursued on or off-duty, are those relationships that
detract from the authority of superiors or result in, or reasonably create the
appearance of, favoritism, misuse of office or position, or the abandonment of
organizational goals for personal interests. Unprofessional relationships can
exist between officers, between enlisted members, between officers and enlisted
members, and between military personnel and civilian employees or contractor
personnel. Familiar relationships in which <span class="calibre3">one member</span>
exercises supervisory or command authority and relationships that involve
shared living accommodations, vacations, transportation, or off-duty interests
on a frequent or recurring basis in the absence of any official purpose or
organizational benefit present a high risk of becoming unprofessional.<span class="calibre7"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal42">6.19.3.<b class="calibre1">
Fraternization.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Fraternization is an aggravated form of
unprofessional relationship.<span class="calibre8"> </span>As defined by the manual for courts-martial<i class="calibre2">,</i> fraternization is a personal
relationship between an officer and an enlisted member that violates the
customary bounds of acceptable behavior in the Air Force and prejudices good
order and discipline, discredits the Armed Services, or operates to the
personal disgrace or dishonor of the officer involved. The custom recognizes
that officers will not form personal relationships with enlisted members on
terms of military equality, whether on or off duty. Although the custom originated
in an all-male military, fraternization is gender neutral. Fraternization can
occur between males, between females, and between males and females. Because of
the potential damage fraternization can do to morale, good order, discipline,
and unit cohesion, fraternization is specifically prohibited in the manual for
courts-martial and punishable under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military
Justice.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.20. General
Guidelines on Avoiding Unprofessional Relationships Including Fraternization. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">Military experience has shown that certain kinds of personal
relationships present a high risk for being (or developing into) unprofessional
relationships. Unprofessional relationships negatively impact morale and
discipline. While some personal relationships are not initially unprofessional,
they may become unprofessional when circumstances change. For example, factors
that can change an otherwise permissible relationship into an unprofessional
relationship include the members’ relative positions in the organization and
the members’ relative positions in the supervisory and command chains. Air
Force members, both officer and enlisted, must be sensitive to forming these
relationships and consider the probable impact of their actions on the Air
Force in making their decisions. The rules regarding these relationships must
be somewhat elastic to accommodate differing conditions. However, the
underlying standard is that Air Force members are expected to avoid
relationships that negatively affect morale and discipline. When economic
constraints or operational requirements place officers and enlisted members of
different grades in close proximity with one another (such as combined or joint
clubs, joint recreational facilities, or mixed officer and enlisted housing
areas), military members are expected to maintain professional relationships.
Although maintaining professional relationships is more difficult under certain
circumstances, it does not excuse a member’s responsibility to maintain
standards. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.20.1. <b class="calibre1">Relationships
within an Organization.<i class="calibre2"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">Unduly familiar relationships between members
in which <span class="calibre3">one member</span> exercises supervisory or command
authority over the other can easily be or become unprofessional. Similarly, as
differences in grades increase, even in the absence of a command or supervisory
relationship, there may be more risk that the relationship will become, or is
perceived to be, unprofessional because senior members in military
organizations normally exercise authority or have some direct or indirect
organizational influence over more junior members. The danger for abuse of
authority is always present. A senior member’s ability to directly or
indirectly influence assignments, promotion recommendations, duties, awards, or
other privileges and benefits places both the senior and junior members in a
vulnerable position. Once established, such relationships do not go unnoticed
by other members of the unit. Service members must also avoid unprofessional
relationships (including fraternization) between members of different services,
particularly in joint service operations, because such relationships may have
the same impact on morale and discipline as they would for members assigned to
the same service. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.20.2. <b class="calibre1">Relationships
with Civilian Employees. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">Civilian employees and contractor personnel
are an integral part of the Air Force. They contribute directly to readiness
and mission accomplishment. Consequently, military members of all grades must
maintain professional relationships with civilian employees, particularly those
whom they supervise or direct. They must avoid relationships that adversely
affect or reasonably might adversely affect morale, discipline, and respect for
authority, or that violate law or regulation. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.20.3. <b class="calibre1">Dating and
Close Friendships<i class="calibre2">. </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">Dating, intimate relationships, and close
friendships between men and women are subject to the same policy considerations
as are other relationships. Like any personal relationship, they become a
matter of official concern when they adversely affect morale, discipline, unit
cohesion, respect for authority, or mission accomplishment. Members must
recognize that these relationships can adversely affect morale and discipline,
even when the members are not in the same chain of command or unit. The
formation of such relationships between superiors and subordinates within the
same chain of command or supervision is prohibited because such relationships
invariably raise the perception of favoritism or misuse of position and erode
morale, discipline and unit cohesion. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.20.4. <b class="calibre1">Shared
Activities.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Sharing living accommodations, vacations,
transportation, and off-duty interests on a frequent or recurring basis can be
perceived as unprofessional. Often the frequency of these activities or the
absence of an official purpose or organizational benefit is what causes them to
become, or to be perceived as, unprofessional. While an occasional round of
golf, game of racquetball, or similar activity between a supervisor and
subordinate could remain professional, daily or weekly occurrences could result
in at least the perception of an unprofessional relationship. Similarly, while
it may be appropriate for a first sergeant to play golf with a different group
of officers from his or her organization each weekend in order to get to know
them better, playing with the same officers every weekend may be, or be
perceived as, unprofessional. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.20.5. <b class="calibre1">Training,
Schools, and Professional Military Education. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">Personal relationships
between recruiters and potential recruits during the recruiting process or
between students and faculty or staff in training schools or professional
military education settings are generally prohibited. These interpersonal
relationships are especially susceptible to abuse of position, partiality or
favoritism, or can easily create the appearance of such. This is particularly
true during the recruiting process and in basic military training, because the
potential recruit or junior military member is often unfamiliar with Air Force
standards and dependent on the senior member, and the senior member is in a
position to directly affect, positively or negatively, the career of the junior
member. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.20.6. <b class="calibre1">Other
Relationships. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">Other relationships not specifically
addressed, depending on the circumstances, can lead to actual or perceived
favoritism or preferential treatment, and must be avoided. Examples of
activities that may adversely impact morale, discipline, and respect for
authority include gambling, partying with subordinates, soliciting or making
solicited sales to subordinates, joint business ventures, or soliciting (or
making solicited sales) to members junior in rank, grade, or position. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.21. Consequences of
Unprofessional Conduct. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal23">Military members are subject to lawful
orders. When a military member has been lawfully ordered to cease an
unprofessional relationship or refrain from certain conduct, the military
member is subject to prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for
violating the order. Similarly, all military members are subject to prosecution
for criminal offenses committed incidental to an unprofessional relationship
(such as gambling, adultery, or assault). </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.22. Responsibilities
for Professional Relationships: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal43">6.22.1. <b class="calibre1">Individuals.</b><i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal10">All military members share the responsibility
for maintaining professional relationships. However, the senior member (officer
or enlisted) in a personal relationship bears primary responsibility for
maintaining professional relationships. Leadership requires personnel to
exercise maturity and judgment and avoid relationships that undermine respect
for authority or have a negative impact on morale, discipline, or the mission
of the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">This is especially true of officers and
noncommissioned officers who are expected to exhibit the highest standards of
professional conduct and to lead by example. The senior member in a
relationship is in the best position to appreciate the effect the relationship
could have on an organization and is in the best position to terminate or limit
the extent of the relationship. However, all members should expect to be, and
must be, held accountable for how their conduct impacts the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.22.2. <b class="calibre1">Commanders and
Supervisors.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Commanders and supervisors at all levels have
the authority and responsibility to maintain good order, discipline, and morale
within their units. They may be held accountable for failing to act in
appropriate cases. </p>

<p class="msonormal44"><b class="calibre1">6.23. Actions in
Response to Unprofessional Relationships. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal23">If a relationship is prohibited by AFI
36-2909 or is causing (or if good professional judgment and common sense
indicate that a relationship may reasonably result in) a degradation of morale,
good order, discipline or unit cohesion, a commander or supervisor should take
corrective action.<span class="calibre6"> </span>Actions should normally be the least severe necessary
to terminate the unprofessional aspects of a relationship, but a full spectrum
of administrative actions is available and should be considered. Administrative
actions include, but are not limited to; counseling, reprimand, creation of an
unfavorable information file, removal from position, reassignment, demotion,
delay of or removal from a promotion list, adverse or referral comments in
performance reports, and administrative separation. One or more complementary
actions can be taken. Experience has shown that counseling is often an
effective first step in curtailing unprofessional relationships. More serious
cases may warrant administrative action or nonjudicial punishment<span class="calibre7">. </span>An order to terminate a relationship, or the
offensive portion of a relationship, can and should be given whenever it is
apparent that lesser administrative action may not be effective. Officers or
enlisted members who violate such orders are subject to action under the
Uniform Code of Military Justice for violation of the order.<span class="calibre6"> </span>Instances
of actual favoritism, partiality, or misuse of grade or position may constitute
independent violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice or the punitive
provisions of the Joint Ethics Regulation. </p>

<p class="msonormal45"><b class="calibre1">6.24. Financial
Responsibility. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal46">AFI 36-2906, <i class="calibre2">Personal
Financial Responsibility</i>, establishes administrative and management
guidelines for alleged delinquent financial obligations and for processing
financial claims against Air Force members. The AFI also outlines basic rules
for garnishment. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.24.1.<b class="calibre1"> Responsibilities.
</b></p>

<p class="msonormal47">Military members will: </p>

<p class="msonormal32">6.24.1.1. Pay their just financial
obligations in a proper and timely manner. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">6.24.1.2. Provide adequate financial support
of a spouse, child or any other relative for which the member receives
additional support allowances. Members will also comply with the financial
support provisions of a court order or written support agreement. </p>

<p class="msonormal32">6.24.1.3. Respond to applications for
involuntary allotments of pay within the suspense dates established by the
Defense Finance and Accounting Service or the commander. </p>

<p class="msonormal48">6.24.2. <b class="calibre1">Handling
Complaints. </b>Complainants are often unfamiliar with Air Force organizational
addresses or do not know the member’s actual unit of assignment, and so
frequently address correspondence to the installation commander, staff judge
advocate, or force support squadron. The complaint is forwarded for action to
the individual’s commander, who attempts to respond within 15 days. If the
member has had a permanent change of station, the complaint is forwarded to the
new commander, and the complainant is notified of the referral. If the member
has separated with no further military service or has retired, the complainant
is notified and informed that the member is no longer under Air Force
jurisdiction and the Air Force is unable to assist. (<b class="calibre1">Exception:</b> Retired members’ retirement pay can be garnished for
child support or alimony obligations.) Commanders must actively monitor
complaints until they are resolved. Failure to pay debts or support dependents
can lead to administrative or disciplinary action. If the commander decides the
complaint reflects adversely on the member, this action should be included in
the unfavorable information file. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.24.3. <b class="calibre1">Personal
Financial Management Program. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal49">The personal financial management program is
an Airman and Family Readiness Center program that offers information,
education, and personal financial counseling to help individuals and families
maintain financial stability and reach their financial goals. Personal
financial management program provides education to all personnel upon arrival
at their first duty station. Personal financial management program education
includes, at minimum, facts about personal financial management program,
checkbook maintenance, budgeting, credit buying, state or country liability
laws, and local fraudulent business practices. The personal financial
management program also provides refresher education for all senior airmen and
below upon arrival at a new installation. Personal financial management program
services are free.<span class="calibre3">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.25. Overview. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">DoD policy requires a single, uniform source of standards on
ethical conduct and ethics guidance be maintained within DoD. Each DoD agency
will implement and administer a comprehensive ethics program to ensure
compliance. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.26. Bribery and
Graft.<i class="calibre2"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal23">DoD employees and military members are
directly or indirectly prohibited from giving, offering, promising, demanding,
seeking, receiving, accepting, or agreeing to receive anything of value to
influence any official act. They are prohibited from influencing the commission
of fraud on the U.S., inducing commitment or omission of any act in violation
of a lawful duty, or from influencing testimony given. They are prohibited from
accepting anything of value for, or because of, any official act performed or
to be performed. These prohibitions do not apply to the payment of witness fees
authorized by law or certain travel and subsistence expenses.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.27. Compensation
from Other Sources.</b><i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal23">DoD employees and military members are
prohibited from receiving pay or allowance or supplements of pay or benefits
from any source other than the U.S. for the performance of official service or
duties unless specifically authorized by law. A task or job performed outside
normal work hours does not necessarily allow employees to accept payment for
performing it. If the undertaking is part of one’s official duties, pay for its
performance may not be accepted from any source other than the U.S. regardless
of when it was performed. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.28. Additional Pay
or Allowance.<i class="calibre2"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal23">DoD employees and military members may not
receive additional pay or allowance for disbursement of public money or for the
performance of any other service or duty unless specifically authorized by law.
Subject to certain limitations, civilian DoD employees may hold two distinctly
different federal government positions and receive salaries for both if the
duties of each are performed. Absent specific authority, however, military
members may not do so because any arrangement by a military member for
rendering services to the federal government in another position is
incompatible with the military member’s actual or potential military duties.
The fact that a military member may have leisure hours during which no official
duty is performed does not alter the result. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.29. Commercial
Dealings Involving DoD Personnel.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal23">On or off duty, a DoD employee or military
member shall not knowingly solicit or make solicited sales to DoD personnel who
are junior in rank, grade, or position, or to the family members of such
personnel. In the absence of coercion or intimidation, this does not prohibit
the sale or lease of a DoD employee’s or military member’s noncommercial personal
or real property or commercial sales solicited and made in a retail
establishment during off-duty employment. This prohibition includes the
solicited sale of insurance, stocks, mutual funds, real estate, cosmetics,
household supplies, vitamins, and other goods or services. Solicited sales by
the spouse or other household member of a senior-ranking person to a junior
person are not specifically prohibited but may give the appearance that the DoD
employee or military member is using public office for personal gain. If in
doubt, consult an ethics counselor. Several related prohibitions in this area
include: </p>

<p class="msonormal23">6.29.1. Engaging in off-duty employment or
outside activities that detract from readiness or pose a security risk, as
determined by the employee’s or member’s commander or supervisor. </p>

<p class="msonormal50">6.29.2. Engaging in outside employment or
activities that conflict with official duties. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">6.29.3. Receiving honoraria for performing
official duties or for speaking, teaching, or writing that relates to one’s
official duties. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">6.29.4. Misusing an official position, such
as improper endorsements or improper use of nonpublic information. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">6.29.5. Certain post-government service
employment. See DoD 5500.07-R, Chapter 9, for specific guidance. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.30. Gifts from
Foreign Governments.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">AFI 51-901, <i class="calibre2">Gifts from
Foreign Governments,</i> requires all Air Force military and civilian
personnel, and their dependents, to report gifts from foreign governments if
the gift, or combination of gifts, at one presentation exceeds a U.S. retail
value of $375. Gifts in excess of this minimal value may be accepted on behalf
of the Air Force and a request for disposition instructions should be forwarded
to SAF/AA within 60 days of receiving the gift. This requirement includes gifts
that recipients want to keep for official use or display. The U.S. Attorney
General may bring a civil action in any court of the U.S. against any person
who knowingly solicits or accepts a gift from a foreign government that is not
approved by Congress, or who fails to deposit or report such a gift, as
required by AFI 51-901. Failure to report gifts valued in excess of $375 could
result in a penalty not to exceed the retail value of the gift plus $5,000. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b> The limit on gifts from foreign
governments is set by Congress and changes periodically. Be sure to confirm the
most current limit with your ethics counselor when considering foreign gift
issues. </p>

<p class="msonormal45"><b class="calibre1">6.31. Contributions or
Presents to Superiors: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal51">6.31.1. On an occasional basis, including
any occasion when gifts are traditionally given or exchanged, the following may
be given to an official supervisor by <span class="calibre3">a subordinate or other
employees</span> receiving less pay: </p>

<p class="msonormal32">6.31.1.1. Items, other than cash, with an
aggregate market value of $10 or less. </p>

<p class="msonormal47">6.31.1.2. Items such as food and refreshments
to be shared in the office among several employees. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">6.31.1.3. Personal hospitality provided at a
residence and items given in connection with personal hospitality, which is of
a type and value customarily provided by the employee to personal friends. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">6.31.2. A gift appropriate to the occasion
may be given to recognize special, infrequent occasions of personal
significance, such as marriage, illness, or the birth or adoption of a child.
Contributions or presents are also permissible upon occasions that terminate a
subordinate-official supervisor relationship, such as retirement, separation,
or reassignment. Regardless of the number of employees contributing, the market
value of the gift cannot exceed $300. Even though contributions are voluntary,
the maximum contribution one DoD employee may solicit from another cannot
exceed $10. </p>

<p class="msonormal45"><b class="calibre1">6.32. Federal
Government Resources. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">Federal government resources, including personnel,
equipment, and property, will be used by DoD employees and military members for
official purposes only. Agencies may, however, permit employees or military
members to make limited personal use of resources other than personnel, such as
a computer, calculators, libraries, etc., if the use: </p>

<p class="msonormal23">6.32.1. Does not adversely affect the
performance of official duties by the employee, military member, or other DoD
personnel. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">6.32.2. Is of reasonable duration and
frequency and is made during the employee’s or military member’s personal time,
such as after duty hours or during lunch periods. </p>

<p class="msonormal38">6.32.3. Serves a legitimate public interest,
such as supporting local charities or volunteer services to the community. </p>

<p class="msonormal51">6.32.4. Does not reflect adversely on the
DoD. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">6.32.5. Creates no significant additional
cost to the DoD or government agency. </p>

<p class="msonormal45"><b class="calibre1">6.33. Communication
Systems.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Federal Government communication systems and equipment
including telephones, fax machines, electronic mail, and Internet systems will
be used for official use and authorized purposes only. Official use includes
emergency communications and, when approved by commanders in the interest of
morale and welfare, may include communications by DoD personnel deployed for
extended periods on official DoD business. Authorized purposes include brief
communication while traveling on government business to notify family members
of official transportation or schedule changes. Also authorized are personal
communications from the DoD employee’s or military member’s usual workplace
that are most reasonably made while at the workplace, such as checking in with
spouse or minor children; scheduling doctor, auto, or home repair appointments;
brief Internet searches; and emailing directions to visiting relatives, when
the agency designee permits. However, many restrictions do apply. Consult DoD
5500.07-R<i class="calibre2"> </i>for additional guidance; then
consult the organizational point of contact. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.34. Gambling,
Betting, and Lotteries.</b><i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal5">While on federally owned or leased property or while on
duty, a DoD employee or military member will not participate in any gambling
activity except: </p>

<p class="msonormal23">6.34.1. Activities by organizations composed
primarily of DoD personnel or their dependents for the benefit of welfare funds
for their own members or for the benefit of other DoD personnel or their
dependents, subject to local law and DoD 5500.07-R. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">6.34.2. Private wagers among DoD personnel
if based on a personal relationship and transacted entirely within assigned
government living quarters and subject to local laws. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">6.34.3. Lotteries authorized by any state
from licensed vendors. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 6F—Political Activities</i></b><i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal52"><b class="calibre1">6.35. Overview.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">It is Air Force policy to encourage Regular Air Force
members to carry out their rights and responsibilities of U.S. citizenship.
While on Regular Air Force members are prohibited from engaging in certain
political activities in order to maintain good order and discipline and to
avoid conflicts of interest and the appearance of improper endorsement in
political matters. For more guidance, see <span class="calibre3">DoDD</span>
1344.10, <i class="calibre2">Political Activities by Members
of the Armed Forces</i>, and AFI 51-902, <i class="calibre2">Political
Activities by Members of the U.S. Air Force</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal45"><b class="calibre1">6.36. Rights.<i class="calibre2"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">In general, a member on Regular Air Force may register to
vote, vote, and express his or her personal opinion on political candidates and
issues, but not as a representative of the Armed Forces. Members may make
monetary contributions to a political party, organization or committee that
favors a political candidate or slate of candidates. They may attend partisan
and nonpartisan political meetings or rallies as spectators when not in
uniform. </p>

<p class="msonormal44"><b class="calibre1">6.37. Prohibitions.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal5">A member on Regular Air Force will not use his or her
official authority or influence to interfere with an election, affect the
course or outcome of an election, solicit votes for a particular candidate or
issue, or require or solicit political contributions from others. A member
cannot participate in partisan political management, campaigns, or conventions.
Members who engage in any of the prohibited activities listed in paragraph 4.1
of AFI 51-902, are subject to prosecution under Article 92, UCMJ, in addition
to any other applicable provision of the UCMJ or Federal law. A member may not
be a candidate for, or hold, civil office except as outlined in paragraph
6.37.1. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.37.1. <b class="calibre1">Candidacy for
Elected Office.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">A member may not campaign as a nominee or as
a candidate for nomination. However, enlisted members may seek and hold
nonpartisan civil office, such as a notary public or school board member,
neighborhood planning commission, or similar local agency, as long as such
office is held in a private capacity and does not interfere with the
performance of military duties. There are also specific exceptions to the
prohibition on holding elected office that permit reservists in certain elected
or appointed civil offices in federal, state, and local government to remain in
office when called to Regular Air Force for no more than 270 days. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.37.2.<b class="calibre1"> Additional
Specific Prohibitions. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal33">A member may not: </p>

<p class="msonormal32">6.37.2.1. Allow, or cause to be published,
partisan political articles signed or authorized by the member for soliciting
votes for or against a partisan political party or candidate. </p>

under the auspices of a partisan political group or distribute partisan
political literature. </p>

housing. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">6.37.2.10. For additional prohibitions refer
to AFI 51-902, paragraph 4.1. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.38. Voting. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal23">The DoD Federal Voting Assistance Program is
responsible for administering the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee
Voting Act. Specifically, the DoD Federal Voting Assistance Program mission is
to inform and educate U.S. citizens worldwide of their right to vote; foster
voting participation; and protect the integrity of and enhance the electoral
process at the Federal, state, and local levels. The Uniformed and Overseas
Citizens Absentee Voting Act requires that states and territories allow certain
groups of citizens, including military members on Regular Air Force and their
families, to register and vote absentee in elections for federal offices. In
many states, laws exist that allow military members and their families to vote
absentee in state and local elections. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens
Absentee Voting Act requires each federal department and agency with personnel
covered by the act to have a voting assistance program. Critical to the success
of this program are the voting assistance officers. These individuals, military
and civilian, are responsible for providing accurate nonpartisan voting
information and assistance to all of the citizens they are appointed to help.
They aid in ensuring citizens understand their voting rights, to include
providing procedures on how to vote absentee. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">6.38.1. The DoD Federal Voting Assistance
Program is responsible for administering the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens
Absentee Voting Act and the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act.
Enacted in 1986, Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act protects
the right of service members to vote in federal elections regardless of where
they are stationed. This law requires that states and territories allow members
of the U.S. Uniformed Services and merchant marine, their family members and
U.S. citizens residing outside the United States to register and vote absentee
in elections for federal offices.<span class="calibre3">  </span>In
many states, laws exist that allow military members and their families to vote
absentee in state and local elections. Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee
Voting Act was expanded significantly in 2009, when Congress passed the
Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act to provide greater protections for
service members, their families and other overseas citizens. Among other
provisions, the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act requires states to
transmit validly-requested absentee ballots to Uniformed and Overseas Citizens
Absentee Voting Act voters no later than 45 days before a federal election,
when the request has been received by that date, except where the state has
been granted an undue hardship waiver approved by the Department of Defense for
that election. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">6.38.2. The DoD Federal Voting Assistance
Program mission is to inform and educate U.S. citizens worldwide of their right
to vote; foster voting participation; and protect the integrity of and enhance
the electoral process at the Federal, state, and local levels. Uniformed and
Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act requires each federal department and
agency with personnel covered by the act to have a voting assistance program.
Critical to the success of this program are the voting assistance officers.
These individuals, military and civilian, are responsible for providing
accurate nonpartisan voting information and assistance to all of the citizens
they are appointed to help. They aid in ensuring citizens understand their
voting rights, to include providing procedures on how to vote absentee. More
information about the Air Force program can be found in AFI 36-3107, <i class="calibre2">Voting Assistance Program</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal53"><b class="calibre1">6.39. Dissident and
Protest Activities. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">Air Force commanders have the inherent authority and
responsibility to take action to ensure the mission is performed and to
maintain good order and discipline. This authority and responsibility includes
placing lawful restriction on dissident and protest activities. Air Force
commanders must preserve the service member’s right of expression to the
maximum extent possible, consistent with good order, discipline, and national
security. To properly balance these interests, commanders must exercise calm
and prudent judgment and should consult with the staff judge advocate. For more
detail, review AFI 51-903, <i class="calibre2">Dissident and Protest
Activities</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.39.1. <b class="calibre1">Possessing or
Distributing Printed Materials.<i class="calibre2"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal19">Air Force members may not distribute or post any printed or
written material other than publications of an official government agency or
base-related activity within any Air Force installation without permission of
the installation commander or that commander’s designee. Members who violate
this prohibition are subject to disciplinary action under Article 92 of the
Uniform Code of Military Justice. </p>

<p class="msonormal54">6.39.2. <b class="calibre1">Writing for
Publications. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal55">Air Force members may not write for
unofficial publications, including blogs and other electronic social media
journalistic forums during duty hours. While unofficial publication, such as an
“underground newspaper,” are not prohibited, they may not be produced using
government or non-appropriated fund property or supplies on or <span class="calibre3">offduty</span>. Any publication that contains language, the
utterance of which is punishable by the Uniform Code of Military Justice or
other federal laws, may subject a person involved in its printing, publishing,
or distribution to prosecution or other disciplinary action. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.39.3. <b class="calibre1">Off-Limits
Action.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Action may be initiated under AFJI 31-213, <i class="calibre2">Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Boards and
Off-Installation Liaison and Operations,</i> to make certain establishments off
limits. An establishment runs the risk of being off limits if its activities
include counseling service members to refuse to perform their duties or to
desert, or when involved in acts with a significant adverse effect on health,
welfare, or morale of military members. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.39.4. <b class="calibre1">Prohibited
Activities.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Military personnel must reject participation
in organizations that espouse supremacist causes; attempt to create illegal
discrimination based on race, color, gender, religion, national origin, or
ethnic group; advocate the use of force or violence; otherwise engage in the
effort to deprive individuals of their civil rights; or knowingly wear gang
colors, clothes, tattoos, or body markings. Active participation, such as
publicly demonstrating or rallying, fundraising, recruiting and training
members, organizing or leading such organizations, or otherwise engaging in
activities the commander finds to be detrimental to good order, discipline, or
mission accomplishment, is incompatible with military service and prohibited.
Members who violate this prohibition are subject to disciplinary action under
Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">6.39.5. <b class="calibre1">Demonstrations
and Similar Activities. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">Demonstrations or other activities within an
Air Force installation that could result in interfering with or preventing the
orderly accomplishment of a mission of the installation or which present a
clear danger to loyalty, discipline, or morale of members of the Armed Forces
are prohibited and are punishable under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of
Military Justice. Air Force members are prohibited from participating in
demonstrations when they are on duty, in a foreign country, in uniform,
involved in activities that constitute a breach of law and order, or when
violence is likely to result.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.40. Public
Statements.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">When making public statements, AFI 35-101, <i class="calibre2">Public Affairs Responsibilities and
Management,</i> governs members<i class="calibre2">.</i> Each
Air Force member has a personal responsibility for the success of the Air Force
Public Affairs Program. As representatives of the service in both official and
unofficial contact with the public, members have many opportunities to
contribute to positive public opinions toward the Air Force. Therefore, each
person must strive to make contacts show the highest standards of conduct and
reflect the Air Force core values. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">6.40.1. <b class="calibre1">Do.</b><i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal10">Specifically, each Air Force member is
responsible for obtaining the necessary review and clearance, starting with
public affairs, before releasing any proposed statement, text, or imagery to
the public. This includes digital products being loaded on an unrestricted Web
site. Members must ensure the information revealed, whether official or
unofficial, is appropriate for release according to classification requirements
in <span class="calibre3">DoDI</span> 5200.01, <i class="calibre2">Department
of Defense Information Security Program and Protection of Sensitive
Compartmented Information</i>,<i class="calibre2"> </i>and
AFPD 31-4, <i class="calibre2">Information Security</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">6.40.2. <b class="calibre1">Don’t.</b><i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal10">Air Force members must not use their Air
Force association, official title, or position to promote, endorse, or benefit
any profit-making agency. This does not prohibit members from assuming
character or modeling roles in commercial advertisement during their nonduty
hours; however, they cannot wear their uniform or allow their Air Force title
or position to be affixed to the advertisement in any manner or imply Air Force
endorsement of the product or service being promoted. Additionally, they must
not make any commitment to provide official Air Force information to any
non-DoD member or agency, including news media, before obtaining approval
through command or public affairs channels. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">6.41. Conclusion. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">This chapter explained Air Force standards of conduct.
Airmen must learn these standards well enough to be able to clearly explain
them to subordinates, observe these standards, and always enforce their
observation by other members. Used in concert with information presented in
Chapters 5 and 19, this information covered essential issues vital to good
order and discipline and mission effectiveness. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3">3.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Introduction.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal4">The Armed
Forces of the United States are not separate and independent parts of the
government; rather, they compose one of the instruments of national policy.
Since the birth of the Nation, policies and directives have been made by
civilians assigned to the military and to the executive and legislative
branches of the government. Military leaders do not make national military
policy decisions. Civilian leadership is a key concept in the military
organization, beginning with the President’s role as Commander in Chief. This
chapter begins with a discussion of the President’s role. The chapter
highlights the structure of the Department of Defense and defines the roles of
the military departments, Joint Chiefs of Staff, unified combatant commands,
and combined commands. Finally, this chapter emphasizes the key elements of the
Department of the Air Force, focuses on force structure and major commands, and
includes a discussion about the structure and functions of the various lower
levels of command and Air Reserve Components. <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 3B—Command
Authority and Department of Defense </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3">3.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Commander in Chief. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">The United States Constitution establishes the basic
principle of civilian control of the Armed Forces. As Commander in Chief, the
President has final command authority. However, as head of the executive
branch, he is subject to the checks and balances system of the legislative and
judicial branches. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3">3.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Department of Defense. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7">Established by the National Security Act of 1947, the
Department of Defense’s function is to maintain and employ Armed Forces. The
Department of Defense includes the Office of the Secretary of Defense; the
Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Joint Staff; and the Departments of the Army, Navy
(including the United States Marine Corps), and Air Force. Furthermore, the
Department of Defense includes the unified combatant commands and forces
dedicated to combined commands, defense agencies, and Department of Defense
field activities. As the civilian head of the Department of Defense, the
Secretary of Defense reports directly to the President.  </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3">3.4.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Secretary of Defense.</b><i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal8">The President appoints the Secretary of Defense with
the advice and consent of the Senate. The Secretary of Defense serves as
principal defense policy advisor to the President and is responsible for the
formulation of general defense policy, policy related to all matters of direct
and primary concern to the Department of Defense, and for the execution of
approved policy. The operational chain of command runs from the President to
the Secretary of Defense to the combatant commanders. A specific responsibility
of the Secretary of Defense is providing written policy guidance for Department
of Defense component chief’s use to prepare and review program recommendations
and budget proposals. The Secretary’s guidance includes national security
objectives and policies, military mission priorities, and the projected levels
for available resources. The Secretary of Defense also provides the Chairman,
Joint Chiefs of Staff with written policy guidance to prepare and review
contingency plans. The Secretaries of the military departments and the
commanders of the combatant commands are provided written guidelines to direct
the effective detection and monitoring of all potential aerial and maritime
threats to the national security of the United States. </p>

<p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre3">3.4.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">The Armed Forces Policy Council. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">The Armed Forces Policy Council<i class="calibre2"> </i>assists in
matters requiring a long-range view and in formulating broad defense policy.
The council advises the Secretary of Defense on matters of broad policy and
reports on other matters as requested. The council consists of the Secretary of
Defense (Chairman); the Deputy Secretary of Defense; Secretaries of the Army,
Navy, and Air Force; the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff; Under Secretaries of
Defense for Policy and for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics; the Deputy
under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology; and the four service
chiefs. Sometimes other departments and agencies in the executive branch are
invited to attend specific meetings. </p>

<p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre3">3.4.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Under Secretaries of Defense.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal11">There are five Under Secretaries of Defense (Policy;
Comptroller; Personnel and Readiness; Acquisition, Technology and Logistics;
and Intelligence) who assist the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense
receives staff assistance through a number of special agencies, such as the
Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Security Service, and Defense Logistics
Agency, which provide special skills, expertise, and advice.  </p>

<p class="msonormal12"><b class="calibre1">3.5. Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7">Appointed by the President, by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate, the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff is selected from the
officers of the regular components of the Armed Forces. The Chairman, while so
serving, holds the grade of general or, in the case of the Navy, holds the
grade of admiral, and outranks all other officers of the Armed Forces. However,
the Chairman may not exercise military command over the Joint Chiefs of Staff
or any of the Armed Forces. The operational chain of command runs from the
President to the Secretary of Defense to the combatant commanders. However, a
provision of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of
1986 permits the President to authorize communications through the Chairman,
Joint Chiefs of Staff. Consequently, DoDD 5100.01, <i class="calibre2">Functions of the
Department of Defense and Its Major Components,</i> places the Chairman, Joint
Chiefs of Staff in the communications chain of command. The Chairman, Joint
Chiefs of Staff is the principal military advisor to the President, the
National Security Council, and the Secretary of Defense. Further, the Secretary
of Defense may assign responsibility for overseeing the activities of the
combatant commands to the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. </p>

<p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre3">3.5.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal13">The Vice Chairman, appointed by the President, by and with
the advice and consent of the Senate, is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
and performs such duties as prescribed by the Chairman, with the approval of
the Secretary of Defense. The Vice Chairman cannot be from the same Uniformed
Service as the Chairman, and serves a tour of 2 years and may be reappointed
for two additional terms. The Vice Chairman serves as the Acting Chairman in
the absence, vacancy or disability of the Chairman. </p>

<p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre3">3.5.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman</b>. </p>

<p class="msonormal14"><span class="calibre5">Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman (SEAC) is a
military position within the United States Department of Defense and is
designated the senior noncommissioned officer in the United States Armed
Forces. The SEAC is appointed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS)
to serve as an advisor to the Chairman and the Secretary of Defense on all
matters involving joint and combined total force integration, utilization,
health of the force, and joint development for enlisted personnel. The SEAC
also serves as a spokesperson to leaders and organizations on applicable issues
affecting the total enlisted force</span> </p>

<p class="msonormal12"><b class="calibre1">3.6. Joint Chiefs of Staff: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre3">3.6.1.<span class="calibre4">                    
</span></span>Subject to the authority, direction, and control of the President
and the Secretary of Defense, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff serve as
advisors to the President, Secretary of Defense, and the National Security
Council. They provide the strategic direction of the Armed Forces. They review
major materiel and personnel requirements of the Armed Forces according to
strategic and logistic requirements and establish joint doctrine. Members of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff are also responsible for the assignment of logistic
responsibilities to the military services, formulation of policies for joint
training, and coordination of military education. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre3">3.6.2.<span class="calibre4">                    
</span></span>Members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are the Chairman, Joint
Chiefs of Staff; Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff; Chief of Staff, United
States Army; Chief of Naval Operations; Chief of Staff, United States Air
Force; Commandant of the Marine Corps; and Chief of the National Guard Bureau.
The Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff presides over the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
furnishes the recommendations and views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the
President, National Security Council, or the Secretary of Defense. Other
members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff may also provide advice to these bodies,
when requested. If a member disagrees with an opinion of the Chairman, Joint
Chiefs of Staff, the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff must present this advice
in addition to his or her own. For the service chiefs (United States Army,
Chief of Naval Operations, Chief of Staff, United States Air Force, Commandant
of the Marine Corps), their Joint Chiefs of Staff duties take precedence over
all other duties. Consequently, as the military heads of their respective
services, Joint Chiefs of Staff members delegate many duties to their vice
chiefs of staff while retaining overall responsibility. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3">3.7.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Joint Staff.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">The Joint Staff assists members of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff in carrying out their assigned responsibilities of
strategic direction, unified operation of combatant commands, and the
integration of all land, naval, and air forces into an efficient force. By law,
the direction of the Joint Staff rests exclusively with the Chairman, Joint
Chiefs of Staff. The Chairman normally manages the Joint Staff through the
Director of the Joint Staff. The Director of the Joint Staff is selected by the
Chairman, after consultation with other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and with the approval of the Secretary of Defense. The staff’s more than 1,500
military and civilian personnel are composed of approximately equal numbers of
officers from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Marines make up about 20 percent
of the number allocated to the Navy.  The Joint Staff is prohibited from
functioning as a General Staff, and has no executive authority. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3">3.8.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Unified Combatant Commands and Combined Commands: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre3">3.8.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Unified Combatant Commands.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal17">The President, assisted by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of
Staff through the Secretary of Defense, establishes unified combatant commands
for the performance of military missions. The Secretary of Defense assigns
military missions through the Unified Command Plan. A unified combatant command
has a broad, continuing mission and is composed of forces from two or more
military departments. The combatant commander deploys, directs, controls, and
coordinates the action of the command’s forces; conducts joint training
exercises; and controls certain support functions. Combatant commanders are
responsible to both the Secretary of Defense and the President. Unified
combatant commands are organized geographically or functionally. Geographic
unified combatant commands include the United States European Command, United
States Pacific Command, United States Northern Command, United States Southern
Command, and the United States Central Command.  Functional Unified Combatant
Commands include the United States Special Operations Command, United States
Transportation Command, and United States Strategic Command. Once assigned to a
unified combatant commands by the Secretary of Defense, a force cannot be
transferred except by authority of the Secretary of Defense or under special
procedures of the Secretary of Defense office with the approval of the
President. All units assigned to a unified combatant command remain under the
combatant command authority of the unified combatant command commander and the
administrative control authority of the respective Service Component Commander.
</p>

<p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre3">3.8.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Combined Commands.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Combined commands consist of forces from more than
one allied nation. Since combined commands are binational or multinational,
their missions and responsibilities (including command responsibilities) must
establish, assign, and conform to binational and multinational agreements.
Normally a combined command operates under the terms of a treaty, alliance, or
bilateral agreement between or among the nations concerned. The North American
Aerospace Defense Command, Combined Forces Command Korea, and Allied Command
Operations are examples of multinational commands. </p>

<p class="msonormal12"><b class="calibre1">3.9. Military Departments.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal7">The military departments consist of the Army, Navy
(including the Marine Corps and, in wartime, the Coast Guard), and the Air
Force. The Service Secretaries are responsible for providing efficiently
organized, trained, and equipped forces to the combatant commanders. Although
operational command of the forces rests with the combatant commanders under the
direction of the Secretary of Defense, the Service Secretaries assist the
Secretary of Defense in managing the administrative, training, and logistic
functions of the military departments. Except in operational matters, the
Secretary of Defense can issue orders to a Service through their Secretary.
Each Service develops and trains their forces to perform functions that support
the efforts of other Services to accomplish the overall military objectives.
The military departments share general and specific functions as outlined
below, and the Air Force has primary functions designed to support the general
and specific functions of the military departments. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">3.9.1.<b class="calibre1"> General Functions.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal13">The traditional roles and mission of each branch of Service
are commonly referred to as functions. Besides specific combat roles, they
furnish operational forces to unified commands. The Secretary of Defense and
the Joint Chiefs of Staff established the functions of each branch of the Armed
Forces in the Key West Agreement of 1948. The Key West Agreement was revised in
1953 and again in 1958. The general functions of the Armed Forces are to: </p>

territory (Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands) or the commanding general of the
District of Columbia National Guard. Each of the 54 National Guard
organizations is supervised by the adjutant general of the state or territory.
Under state law, the Air National Guard provides protection of life, property
and preserves peace, order and public safety. These missions are accomplished
through emergency relief support during natural disasters such as floods,
earthquakes and forest fires; search and rescue operations; support to civil

<p class="msonormal38"><span class="calibre3">3.17.1.10.3.<span class="calibre4">     </span></span><b class="calibre1">Organization.</b>
AFRC has several mission support groups that provide a wide range of services,
including medical and aeromedical evacuation, aerial port, civil engineer,
security forces, intelligence, communications, mobility support, logistics and
transportation operations. </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><span class="calibre3">3.17.2.<span class="calibre4">                 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Field Operating Agencies.</b>  </p>

<p class="msonormal48">Field operating agencies are subdivisions of
the Air Force directly subordinate to a Headquarters Air Force functional
manager. A field operating agency performs field activities beyond the scope of
the major commands. The activities are specialized or associated with an Air
Force-wide mission and do not include functions performed in management
headquarters (such as Headquarters AMC), unless specifically directed by a
Department of Defense authority. Two examples are the Air Force Personnel
Center under the Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel, and Services,
and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations under the Inspector General.
Similar organizations at major command level are called major command field
operating agencies. </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><span class="calibre3">3.17.3.<span class="calibre4">                 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Direct Reporting Units.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal48">Direct reporting units are Air Force
subdivisions directly subordinate to the Chief of Staff, Air Force. A direct
reporting unit performs a mission that does not fit into any of the major
commands. A direct reporting unit has many of the same administrative and
organizational responsibilities as a major command. Two examples are the Air
Force District of Washington and the United States Air Force Academy. </p>

<p class="msonormal12"><b class="calibre1">3.18. Lower Levels of Command.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal7">Below major commands are several levels of command. The Air
Force component numbered Air Forces and numbered Air Forces administratively
report directly to the major command. Wings, groups, squadrons, and flights
report to either a component numbered Air Force or a numbered Air Force,
whichever is appropriate. </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><span class="calibre3">3.18.1.<span class="calibre4">                 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Air Force Component Numbered Air Forces. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal53">The Air Force currently has ten Air Force
component numbered Air Forces dedicated, to supporting the unified/sub-unified
combatant command and joint task force commanders. These component numbered Air
Forces (nicknamed warfighting headquarters), when established, are the primary
operational-level warfighting component commands. The component numbered Air
Forces headquarters normally consists of an Air Force forces staff and an assigned
air and space operations center or operations center. They are dedicated to
supporting the unified combatant commander and subordinate joint force
commanders across the full range of military operations. The component numbered
Air Force commander supporting a geographic combatant command will normally be
prepared to assume responsibilities as the joint force air component commander
for joint military operations in his or her respective area of operations, and
command a joint task force as required. Component numbered Air Forces include 1<sup class="calibre27">st</sup>
Air Force (Air Force North), 3<sup class="calibre27">d</sup> Air Force (Air Force Europe), 7<sup class="calibre27">th</sup>
Air Force (Air Force Korea), 8<sup class="calibre27">th</sup> Air Force (Air Force Strategic

parenthetical in the name of a component numbered Air Force indicates the
combatant command to which they are assigned. </p>

<p class="msonormal54"><span class="calibre3">3.18.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Numbered Air Force. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal48">The numbered Air Force is an administrative
level of command directly under a major command. Numbered Air Forces provide
intermediate level operational leadership and supervision. They do not have
complete functional staffs. In non-component numbered Air Forces, the number of
personnel assigned varies but should not exceed 99 manpower authorizations
without an approved waiver from Headquarters Air Force/A1M. A numbered Air
Force is assigned subordinate units, such as wings, groups, and squadrons. </p>

<p class="msonormal55"><span class="calibre3">3.18.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Wing.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal48">The wing is a level of command below the
numbered Air Force and has a distinct mission with significant scope. A wing is
responsible for maintaining the installation and may have several squadrons in
more than one dependent group. The different types of wings are operational,
air base, or specialized mission. Wings will have a minimum adjusted population
of at least 1,000 (750 for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command
wings). This will include manpower authorizations, students, and a percentage of
contractor workforces. See Figure 3.1 for a common wing structure. </p>

<p class="msonormal56"><span class="calibre3">3.18.3.1.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Operational Wing.</b> An
operational wing is one that has an operations group and related operational
mission activity assigned. When an operational wing performs the primary
mission of the base, it usually maintains and operates the base. In addition,
an operational wing is capable of self-support in functional areas such as
maintenance and munitions, as needed. When an operational wing is a tenant
organization, the host command provides it with varying degrees of base and
logistics support. </p>

<p class="msonormal56"><span class="calibre3">3.18.3.2.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Air Base Wing.</b> An
air base wing performs a support function rather than an operational mission.
This type of wing maintains and operates a base. An air base wing often
provides functional support to a major commands headquarters. </p>

<p class="msonormal48"><span class="calibre3">3.18.3.3.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Specialized Mission
Wing.</b> A specialized mission wing performs a specialized mission and usually
does not have aircraft or missiles assigned. Examples include intelligence
wings, training wings, and so on. This wing is either a host or a tenant wing,
depending on whether it maintains and operates the base. </p>

<p class="msonormal57">3.18.4. <b class="calibre1">Group.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal58">A group is a level of command below
the wing. Like the numbered Air Force, a group is a tactical echelon with
minimal staff support. A group usually has two or more subordinate units. A
dependent group is a mission, logistics, support, medical, or large functional
unit, such as a civil engineer group. Such groups may possess small supporting
staff elements that are organized as sections, such as standardization and
evaluation or quality control. An independent group has the same functions and
responsibilities as a like-type wing, but its scope and size do not warrant
wing-level designation. Groups will have a minimum adjusted population of at
least 400 (200 for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command groups).
This includes manpower authorizations, students, and a percentage of contractor
workforces. </p>

</span></span><b class="calibre1">Squadron.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal62">The squadron is the basic unit in the Air Force. The
different types of squadrons are either a mission unit, such as an operational
flying squadron, or a functional unit, such as a civil engineer, security
forces, or logistics readiness squadron. Squadrons vary in size according to
responsibility. Squadrons will have a minimum adjusted population of at least
35. This includes manpower authorizations, students, and a percentage of
contractor workforces. </p>

</span></span><b class="calibre1">Flight.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal48">If internal subdivision is required, a flight
may consist of sections, then elements. The different types of flights are
numbered/named, alpha, or functional. </p>

<p class="msonormal64"><span class="calibre3">3.18.6.1.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Numbered/Named
Flight.</b> This is the lowest level unit in the Air Force. A numbered or named
flight primarily incorporates smaller elements into an organized unit. The
administrative characteristics for this type of flight include, strength
reporting, like those of a squadron. </p>

<p class="msonormal62"><span class="calibre3">3.18.6.2.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Alpha Flight.</b> Alpha
flights are part of a squadron (usually a mission squadron) and composed of
several elements that perform identical missions. Because an alpha flight is
not a unit, this type of a flight is not subject to unit reporting. </p>

<p class="msonormal65"><span class="calibre3">3.18.6.3.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Functional Flight.</b>
Functional flights are usually part of a squadron and composed of elements that

<p class="msonormal27"><span class="calibre3">3.19.1.<span class="calibre4">                 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Components.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal67">The Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve
form a significant part of our aerospace capability. Together they are called
the Air Reserve Component. Forces are drawn from the Air Reserve Component when
circumstances require the active force to rapidly expand. AFPD 10-3, <i class="calibre2">Air
Reserve Component Forces, </i>establishes policy to fully integrate the Air
National Guard, Air Force Reserve, and active Air Force into a single Total
Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><span class="calibre3">3.19.2.<span class="calibre4">                 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Staffing and Equipping.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal68">Air Reserve Component forces are staffed and
trained to meet the same training standards and readiness levels as active
component forces and are supplied with the same equipment on an equal priority.
The active force can only withdraw, divert, or reassign equipment for other
commitments with the Secretary of Defense’s written approval. To ensure
responsiveness and combat readiness, Air Reserve Component forces are
continuously evaluated and modernized. </p>

<p class="msonormal69"><span class="calibre3">3.19.3.<span class="calibre4">                 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Use.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal48">AFPD 10-3 states, under the Total Force
policy established by Department of Defense in 1973, that both regular and
reserve assets are considered parts of a single United States military
resource. All aspects of regular and reserve forces are considered when
determining an appropriate force mix. Significant factors include contribution
of forces to national security; availability of forces in view of time,
statutory or regulatory constraints; and the cost to equip and maintain forces.
Considerations unique to Air National Guard units include their dual state and
federal missions. </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><span class="calibre3">3.19.4.<span class="calibre4">                 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Organization.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal48">Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve unit
organization parallels similar Regular Air Force units with one exception: Air
Reserve Component units are sometimes separated to take advantage of state or
regional demographics and are not centralized at major, multisquadron bases, as
is the case with Regular Air Force resources. This exception is beneficial
because it implements a strong relationship with the civilian community and
builds public support for the Air Force as a whole. </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><span class="calibre3">3.19.5.<span class="calibre4">                 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Jurisdiction.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal48">Command jurisdiction for nonmobilized Air
National Guard units is vested in the governor of the state, commonwealth, or
possession, or in the President, who in essence is the governor of the District
of Columbia. The President delegates authority to the Secretary of the Army to carry
out the powers of the President as “governor” of the District of Columbia.
Command of nonmobilized Air Force Reserve units is exercised through the
Commander, Air Force Reserve Command, who, in turn, is responsible to the Chief
of Staff, Air Force. Command of nonmobilized Air Force Reserve individual
mobilization augmentees is exercised concurrently through Air Force Reserve
Command and the unit of attachment. Whenever the President authorizes
mobilization, the Secretary of Defense delegates authority to the Services who
order Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve forces to active duty. When
activated, operational command of Air Reserve Component forces transfers to the
major command commander who is also responsible for establishing training
resources for all assigned or attached Air Reserve Component forces. </p>

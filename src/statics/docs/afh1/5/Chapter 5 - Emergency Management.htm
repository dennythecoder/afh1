</span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Introduction.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal4">The ability of the United States Air Force to carry out its
mission of Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global Power directly depends on
continuance of the mission in the face of adversity. Challenges to mission
accomplishment take many forms ranging from natural disasters, man-made
incidents, terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction, and hostile attacks
that threaten United States interests. The Air Force Emergency Management
Program was developed to ensure the readiness of our Total Force to prepare
for, respond to, and recover from the effects of incidents that endanger the
lives of personnel and jeopardize mission accomplishment. Airmen may be called
upon to serve the program in a variety of ways; from attending localized
emergency preparedness briefings to being a member of a specialized team. In
today’s threat-laden environment, every Airman must play their part to ensure
their installation has a successful Emergency Management program. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3">5.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Air Force Emergency Management Program. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">Protection of personnel and operational resources is
essential to successful Air Force operations. The Air Force Emergency
Management program develops and implements measures for, and manages activities
related to, emergency preparedness, incident management, response and recovery
operations, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense, and
consequence management. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3">5.2.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>The primary mission of the Air Force Emergency Management Program
is to save lives; minimize the loss or degradation of resources; and continue,
sustain, and restore operational capability in an all-hazards physical threat
environment at Air Force installations worldwide.<span class="calibre5"> </span>The ancillary missions are to support homeland defense
and civil support operations and to provide support to civil and host nation
authorities according to Department of Defense publications and through the
appropriate combatant command. These missions are accomplished using the Air
Force Incident Management System, which employs the installation disaster
response force, as the structure for all responses. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3">5.2.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>The Air Force Emergency Management Program contributes to mission
assurance, which is defined as the process to protect or ensure the continued
function and resilience of capabilities and assets—including personnel,
equipment, facilities, networks, information, and information systems,
infrastructure, and supply chains in any operating environment or condition,
and the continuation of mission essential functions necessary to perform the
operations of the installation in support of the national military strategy. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">5.3. The Five Emergency Management Mission Areas. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">The Air Force Emergency Management program mission areas
(Figure 5.1.) include prevention, protection, response, recovery, and
mitigation. They are met through preparedness, which includes actions to plan,
organize, equip, train, and exercise prior to disasters and incidents. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre6">                                                                                                                                       </span></p>

<p class="msonormal8">5.3.1.       <b class="calibre1"> Prevention. </b>Prevention includes the
capabilities necessary to avoid, prevent, or stop a threatened or actual act of
terrorism. </p>

<p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre3">5.3.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Protection. </b>Protection provides the capabilities necessary
to protect the installation against all threats and hazards, and manmade or
natural disasters. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre3">5.3.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Response.</b> <span class="calibre6"> </span>Response
includes actions taken to save lives, protect property, and mitigate the
effects of an incident. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">5.3.4.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Recovery.</b> Recovery includes operations such as
implementing casualty treatment, unexploded explosive ordnance safing,
personnel and resource decontamination, airfield damage repair, and facility
restoration. Response contains three essential elements; notification, response,
and protective actions. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">5.3.5.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Mitigation.</b> Mitigation comprises the capabilities
necessary to reduce the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of
future disasters. These capabilities are designed to reduce or eliminate risks
to persons or property or to lessen the actual or potential effects or
consequences of a disaster or incident. </p>

<p class="msonormal12"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3">5.4.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Air Force Incident Management System. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">The Emergency Management program accomplishes its mission
through the Air Force Incident Management System which utilizes the disaster
response force. Air Force Incident Management System aligns Emergency
Management planning and response with Homeland Security Directive 5, <i class="calibre2">Management
of Domestic Incidents; </i>the National Incident Management System; the
National Response Framework, and Office of the Secretary of Defense guidance
while preserving unique military requirements. The system provides the Air
Force with a single, comprehensive approach to incident management while
allowing scalable and flexible response options to organize field-level
operations for a broad spectrum of emergencies. </p>

<p class="msonormal12"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3">5.5.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Air Force Emergency Management Structure. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal13">The Air Force Emergency Management
program has two structural elements; a strategic planning and management staff
to maintain the Emergency Management program and a disaster response force to
manage or conduct incident response operations (Figure 5.2.). The planning and
management staff provide an overall cross-functional installation risk
management program for developing threat and hazard plans and budget, and is
comprised of four functions; the office of emergency management, unit emergency
management representatives, the emergency management working group, and the
wing inspection team. See AFI 10-2501, <i class="calibre2">Air Force Emergency Management
Program</i>, for definitions of planning and management functions. The disaster
response force are the organizational functions that respond to disasters or
accidents to establish command and control and support disaster operations. The
disaster response force includes the Crisis Action Team, Emergency Operations
Center, unit control centers, Command Post, incident commander, first and
emergency responders, and specialized and support recovery teams. </p>

</span></span><b class="calibre1">Crisis Action Team.          Structure – Disaster Response
Force.</b><span class="calibre6"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal16">The Crisis Action Team directs strategic
actions supporting the installation’s mission. This team is activated to
provide a command, control, and communication link to higher headquarters and
comparable civilian agencies and to coordinate the incident response. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">5.5.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Emergency Operations Center. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">The Emergency Operations Center is the command and control
support element that coordinates information and resources to the installation
actions before, during, and after an incident. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">5.5.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Unit Control Center. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">Unit control centers provide response and
recovery support to the Incident Commander as directed by the Emergency
Operations Center and mission support to the installation commander as directed
by Crisis Action Team. Unit control centers provide <sub class="calibre9"><span class="calibre10"> </span></sub>a
focal point within an organization to maintain unit command and control, relay
information to and from unit personnel, provide expertise to the emergency
operations center or the incident commander, and leverage unit resources to
respond to and mitigate the incident. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">5.5.4.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Command Post. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal19">As a command and control node, the command
post assists in directing installation emergency management and response
actions. The command post maintains notification rosters, provides and collects
information from the unit control centers, and coordinates with the crisis
action team and the Emergency Operations Center. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">5.5.5.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Incident Commander. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal19">The incident commander is a trained and
experienced responder that provides on-scene tactical control using subject
matter experts and support from other functions. Fire Emergency Services is the
incident commander for all incidents involving two or more response agencies. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">5.5.6.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">First Responders. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal19">First responders deploy immediately to the
scene to provide initial command and control, to save lives, and to suppress
and control hazards. First responders include fire and emergency services,
security forces, and medical personnel. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">5.5.7.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Emergency Responders. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal19">Emergency responders deploy after the first
responders to expand command and control and provide additional support.
Emergency responders include emergency management, explosive ordnance disposal,
bioenvironmental engineering personnel and may include other subject matter
experts. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">5.5.8.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Specialized and Support Recovery Teams. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal20">Specialized teams are formed from the
existing installation and unit personnel resources to support emergency
response operations. Specialized teams include the emergency management support
team, shelter management team, contamination control team, post-attack
reconnaissance team, and other specialized teams. </p>

<p class="msonormal21"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3">5.6.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Protective Measures. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">Threats and hazards that may affect your installation could
be natural, man-made, or technological. Disasters or incidents resulting from a
threat or hazard can occur at any time with little or no advance warning. These
incidents can be local or widespread, predictable or unpredictable. There are
ways to prepare for and cope with these events, regardless of the type of
incident. Take time to think; then act according to the situation.
Installations, as well as individuals, need to identify local threats and
hazards, prepare early, and develop emergency plans. For preparation guidance,
contact the installation readiness and emergency management flight and visit
the Air Force “Be Ready” website (<a href="http://www.beready.af.mil/" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre11">http://www.beready.af.mil/</span></a><a href="http://www.beready.af.mil/" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre12">)</span></a>. </p>

<p class="msonormal21"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3">5.7.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Air Force Emergency Notification Signals. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal22">Every Air Force installation must have a rapid and
effective system to quickly disseminate emergency information such as watches,
warnings, evacuation routes, and protective actions. When a disaster or
incident affecting the base is imminent or inprogress, personnel must respond
to directions communicated over mass notification and warning systems (Figure
5.3). These messages may be visual or audible. Make sure you know how
notifications and warnings are executed at your installation to ensure you are
promptly informed and ready to properly respond to local emergencies.<span class="calibre5"> </span></p>

</span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Personnel Sheltering. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal25">All installations are required to conduct
threat-based shelter planning. Shelter selection is based on structural and
personnel housing capabilities in relation to the types of disasters. Personnel
must know where their shelter is located and understand shelter-processing
procedures. Shelter-in-place is used to provide temporary protection in a
structure for short or no-notice emergencies, such as hazardous material
incident or a tornado, when the type or extent of the hazard is unknown and/or
evacuation at the time would be dangerous. Active shooter lock-down procedures
are not the same as those used for shelter-inplace. Refer to AFMAN 10-2502, <i class="calibre2">Air
Force Incident Management Standards and Procedures</i>, for shelter planning
information. Wartime sheltering addressed in paragraph 5.17.4 and AFMAN
10-2503, <i class="calibre2">Operations in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and
High-Yield Explosives (CBRNE) Environment</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal21"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3">5.9.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Response Procedures. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal26">Commanders must be able to maintain the
primary installation mission, save lives, mitigate damage, and restore
missionessential resources following disasters or incidents. Response levels
will depend on the magnitude of the incident and degree of damage. Each
installation must develop disaster response plans and policies to address local
threats and hazards. The installation emergency management plan 10-2 is the
vehicle for installation planning and response. The plan provides comprehensive
guidance for emergency response to natural (geological, meteorological, and
biological hazards), human-caused (accidental and intentional) or technological
incidents. These categories are detailed in the following sections. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 5D –
Natural Disaster, Man-Made Physical and Technological Hazards </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal21"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3">5.10.<span class="calibre4">  </span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Natural
Disasters. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal25">Natural disasters and severe weather can
create emergency conditions that vary widely in scope, urgency, and degree of
damage and destruction. The installations must develop plans for the hazards
likely to affect their location. Specific actions taken in response, mitigation,
and recovery will vary. A national-level response may be required to help an
Air Force installation recover from large-area natural disasters. </p>

<p class="msonormal25">5.10.1. Natural disasters are categorized as
geological, meteorological, or biological hazards. Natural geological hazards
include earthquake, tsunami, volcano, landslide, and mudslide, subsidence (i.e.
sinkholes, glacier, and iceberg). Natural meteorological hazards include:
flood, flash flood, tidal surge, drought, fire, snow, ice, hail, sleet,
avalanche, windstorm, tropical cyclone, hurricane, tornado, water spout, dust
or sand storm, extreme temperature (heat, cold), lightning strikes, and
geomagnetic storm. Natural biological hazards include diseases that impact
humans or animals such as plague, anthrax, botulism, smallpox, tularemia, viral
hemorrhagic fevers, West Nile Virus, foot and mouth diseases, severe acute
respiratory syndrome, and pandemic disease. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">5.11. Human Caused Hazards. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal25">Installations are threatened with the
possibility of catastrophic man-made hazards, whether accidental or
intentional. All installations must prepare for, and quickly respond to major
accidents to prevent the loss of life, preserve valuable resources, and protect
the environment. </p>

<p class="msonormal25">5.11.1. The Department of Defense is
responsible for responding to incidents involving its resources or resulting
from Department of Defense activities. The military installation, regardless of
size, nearest the scene of the accident or incident will respond to the event
unless otherwise directed by higher headquarters. Upon witnessing an accident
or incident, personnel should alert others in the immediate area and report the
incident to security forces, fire and emergency services, or installation
command and control. After reporting the accident, personnel should: </p>

<p class="msonormal19"><span class="calibre3">5.11.1.1.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>Stay uphill and upwind.
Avoid inhaling fumes, smoke, or vapors. </p>

<p class="msonormal19"><span class="calibre3">5.11.1.2.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>Attempt to rescue and care
for casualties. </p>

<p class="msonormal19"><span class="calibre3">5.11.1.3.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>Avoid handling any material
or component involved in the accident/incident. </p>

<p class="msonormal19"><span class="calibre3">5.11.1.4.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>Evacuate the area if rescue
or containment is impractical, or if directed to evacuate. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">5.11.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Man-Made Accidental. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal19">Man-made accidental incidents include
hazardous materials (for example, explosive, flammable liquid, flammable gas,
flammable solid, oxidizer, poison, radiological, corrosive) spill or release.
An explosion or fire; transportation accident; building or structure collapse;
energy, power, or utility failure; fuel or resource shortage; air or water pollution
or contamination; dam, levee, or other water control structure failure;
financial issues including economic depression, inflation, financial system
collapse; and communication system interruption. </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><span class="calibre3">5.11.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Man-Made Intentional. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal19">Man-made intentional incidents include
terrorism, sabotage, civil disturbance, public unrest, riot, strike or labor
dispute, disinformation, criminal activity (vandalism, arson, theft, fraud,
embezzlement, and data theft), electromagnetic pulse, physical or information
security breach, active shooter, and product defect or contamination. An
overview of man-made intentional incidents involving enemy or terrorist use
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear is provided in Section 5E. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">5.11.3.1. An active shooter is an individual
actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people, most often in
populated areas. In most cases, active shooters use firearms and there is no
pattern or method to their selection of victims. In some cases, active shooters
use improvised explosive devices to create additional victims and impede first
responders. </p>

<p class="msonormal19"><span class="calibre3">5.11.3.1.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Lockdown is declared to protect personnel from an Active Shooter
incident and is a base-wide protective action used to restrict the movement of
personnel and to aid law enforcement first responders in neutralizing the
shooting suspect as quickly as possible. During lockdown, no person may exit or
enter another area until the all clear is broadcasted; unless movement is
required to escape from a dangerous place or situation. </p>

<p class="msonormal19"><span class="calibre3">5.11.3.1.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>If you find yourself involved in an active shooter situation,
remain calm, quickly determine the most reasonable way to protect your own
life. If an escape route is accessible, evacuate the immediate area. If
evacuation is not possible, find a place to create a barricade between you and
the active shooter. As a last resort, and only when your life is in imminent
danger, attempt to disrupt and/or incapacitate the shooter. </p>

<p class="msonormal28">5.11.4.<b class="calibre1"> Technological. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal29">Technologically caused incidents include
central computer, mainframe, software, or application (internal and external);
ancillary support equipment; telecommunications; and energy, power, utility, or
nuclear power plant failure. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 5E—</i></b><i class="calibre2">

Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Hazards. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear, as well as
toxic industrial material, hazards cause adverse effects through deliberate
release and dissemination. Installation chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear defense requires an installationwide team that includes all personnel
to plan, prepare, respond and recover from a chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear incident. Chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear preparedness and defense measures are intended to balance mission
continuation with force survivability to maximize mission effectiveness within
a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear environment. An awareness of
the hazards and protective actions will help you protect yourself in the event
of a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear attack. </p>

<p class="msonormal30"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3">5.13.<span class="calibre4">  </span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Chemical,
Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Threat Agents. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal25">Each chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear threat agent presents a unique hazard. Airmen should know the
importance of understanding what the characteristics, symptoms, and protective
factors are for all chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threat agents
relative to the deployed location. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">5.13.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Chemical. </b>Chemical agents are chemical substances that are
intended for use in military operations to kill, seriously injure, or
incapacitate mainly through their physiological effects. Chemical agents are
categorized according to their physiological effects: lung damaging agents
(choking), blister agents, blood agents, incapacitating agents, and nerve
agents. Also included in the chemical hazards classification are toxic
industrial chemicals. Chemical agents can be delivered through a variety of
means such as tactical ballistic missiles, bombs, artillery, grenades, mines,
and spray attacks. Due to their persistent nature, nerve and blister pose the
primary threat to air bases. </p>

<p class="msonormal31"><span class="calibre3">5.13.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Biological. </b>A biological agent is a microorganism (or a
toxin derived from it) that causes disease in personnel, plants, or animals or
causes the deterioration of materiel. Biological agents include viruses,
bacteria, fungi, and toxins cultured from living organisms. Biological agents
may be found as liquid droplets, aerosols, or dry powders and can be adapted
for use as an adversarial weapon. Biological agents can be delivered through a
variety of means such as spray attacks, aerosol releases, or covert attacks.
Personnel may not experience symptoms immediately after being exposed to
biological agents. Each agent has a different exposure (or incubation) period
before infection. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">5.13.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Radiological and Nuclear. </b>Radiation is a broad term that
applies to a wide range of phenomena. Light (infrared to ultraviolet),
radiofrequency emissions and microwaves are all forms of radiation known as
nonionizing radiation. In general, nonionizing radiation produces heat when it
interacts with the body. In contrast, ionizing radiation has sufficient energy
to produce ions when it interacts with matter (including the human body).
Radiation causes harmful effects to personnel because the ionization and
excitation alters or destroys cell processes and structures essential for the
normal functioning of the cell. </p>

<p class="msonormal19"><span class="calibre3">5.13.3.1.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Radiological Delivery
Means.</b> Adversaries may disseminate radioactive materials by utilizing a
radiological dispersal device. This device disseminates radioactive material
across an area without a nuclear detonation. A radiological dispersal device
could function as a terror weapon or terrain-denial mechanism. For example, a
radiological dispersal device could function by using conventional explosives
to blow-up and scatter radioactive source debris across a relatively small
area; this device is also known as a dirty bomb. </p>

<p class="msonormal19"><span class="calibre3">5.13.3.2.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Nuclear Delivery Means.</b>
Nuclear weapons can be detonated at various altitudes to include subsurface,
surface, airburst, or high altitude. The primary concerns of a nuclear
detonation include blast/shock, thermal radiation (heat), ionizing radiation,
and ballistic debris for surface and shallow subsurface bursts. Nuclear blasts
may also pose an electromagnetic pulse hazard that can cause widespread
communications and/or electrical problems. Each type of burst has a different
level of hazard ratio in regards to ionizing radiation, thermal radiation, and
blast/shock. For example, a subsurface burst may produce a high level of blast
and shock, but very little (if any) ionizing radiation penetrating outside the
surface of the earth. </p>

<p class="msonormal25">5.13.4. <b class="calibre1">Toxic Industrial Material. </b>Toxic
industrial material hazards consist of toxic industrial chemicals, toxic
industrial biologicals, and toxic industrial radiological material. Toxic
industrial materials may be manufactured, stored, distributed, or transported
in close proximity to airbases. These widely available toxic industrial
materials are potential tools for asymmetric attacks against airbases. Most
present a vapor (inhalation) hazard. Toxic industrial materials may also reduce
the oxygen concentration below that required to support life. If there is a
toxic industrial material incident, the most important action is immediate
evacuation outside the hazard’s path (if feasible). Airmen must note that the
protective mask, ensemble, and military standard collective protection filters
are not designed to provide protection from toxic industrial materials. If
evacuation is impractical, implement shelter-in-place procedures. </p>

Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Attack. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal25">The Armed Forces of the United States must
be prepared to conduct prompt, sustained, and decisive combat operations in
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear environments. An adversary‘s
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear capabilities can have a
profound impact on United States and multinational objectives, campaign plans,
and supporting actions, and therefore must be taken into account in planning.
Adversaries use chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear to disrupt
efficient airbase mission operations, incapacitate and kill personnel, and
contaminate equipment, rendering it unusable or dangerous to use. Deterring an
adversary‘s use of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons
depends to a significant degree on effective preparations by the defender to
deny the adversary any meaningful advantage from the employment of such
weapons. </p>

and after a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear event. In-place and
deployed forces must be prepared to conduct combat operations as required by
Air Force, major command, or theater directives. When a crisis or conflict
arises, mobility operations and force deployment begin. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">5.17.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Individual protection is comprised of singular use or a
combination of individual protective equipment, vaccinations and prophylaxis,
protective shelters, evacuation, relocation, exposure control, contamination
control, and warning and notification systems. Measures are taken in stages
equal to the urgency and nature of the threat. Command and theater-specific
instructions will direct the proper individual protective postures. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">5.17.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Regardless of the type of agent, concentration, or method of

ground crew ensemble, a whole-body system which protects the wearer against
chemical-biological warfare agents, toxins, and radiological particulates.
Individual protection includes a protective mask with filters, overgarment,
protective gloves, and footwear covers or overboots, and includes M8 and M9
detector paper, reactive skin decontamination lotion and M295 decontamination
kits. </p>

<p class="msonormal32"><span class="calibre3">5.17.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Nerve Agent Antidote.</b><i class="calibre2"> </i>Medical representatives issue
nerve agent antidotes and pretreatment during increased readiness.
Additionally, medical representatives will issue pyridostigmine bromide tablets
(P-tabs) if they anticipate use of a specific type of nerve agent. Members will
take these tablets only if/when directed by the commander. The tablets, when
combined with the antidote, will limit the effect of certain types of nerve

</span></span><b class="calibre1">Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Wartime
Sheltering.</b><span class="calibre5"> </span>The
installation commander is responsible for establishing a shelter plan and
should designate unit responsibility for preparing and operating each shelter
during a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear event. Shelters are
structures that protect personnel from chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear effects over extended periods. Walls, doors, and windows offer limited
physical barriers to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards
penetration. Heating, ventilation, and cooling systems should be shut off to
prevent chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazard spread.
Personnel may be required to shelter-in-place in the event the type or extent
of the hazard is unknown and/or evacuation at the time would be dangerous. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">5.17.5.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Collective Protection Systems</b>. These systems provide
protection from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents using an
overpressure system to keep threat agents outside the facility, ultimately
allowing the occupants to work or rest inside the facility without wearing
protective gear. Many of these facilities will have integrated contamination
control areas, meaning contaminated personnel are able to enter the facility
once decontaminated. Installations with collective protection systems should
develop local procedures and provide base populace training, as required.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">5.18. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Incident
Management Phases. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal25">Air Force units must take actions to prepare
for, respond to, and recover from or mitigate the effects of a chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear attack or event. These actions will
ensure we can conduct prompt, sustained, and decisive combat operations in
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear environments. </p>

<p class="msonormal25">5.18.1. In each phase, consistent approaches
or actions are designed to save lives and to restore and sustain mission
operations. Airbase attack preparation begins before a potential attack. Attack
response actions focus primarily on individual and weapon systems survival, and
recovery actions focusing on saving lives, detecting and mitigating hazards,
mission restoration, and sustainment. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">5.19. Preparedness. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal25">Countering chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear threats requires extraordinary preparedness.
Conducting preparedness actions effectively and efficiently will increase the
protection of mission critical resources and force survivability. These actions
should be considered mission critical and given a high priority when the threat
of enemy attack using chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents is
high. Your installation will establish several actions to counter chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear attacks during the preparedness phase.
These actions will be dependent on your installation’s threat probabilities and
Airmen should understand the importance of knowing these actions well before a
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear attack. They include actions
associated with alarm conditions, mission-oriented protective postures, split
mission oriented protective posture, and contamination control. Actions begin
upon receipt of the warning order or when the in-place forces are directed to
transition to wartime operations. Installations will refer to their risk
management plan and implement actions according to major command and theater
guidance. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">5.19.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Alarm Conditions and Mission-Oriented Protective Posture
Levels. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal33">Attack warning signals are established and
used to notify base populace of emergency conditions. The warnings may be
communicated as audible alarms, through base public address and/or giant voice
systems, display of alarm condition flags, or through other communication
channels. The Air Force uses a standardized alarm system (see Figure 5.4) and
mission-oriented protective posture levels to communicate the appropriate
defense posture for in-place forces to take to transition to wartime chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear operations. Attack warning signals are
used to posture air base for attacks, warn of attacks in progress, initiate
post attack recovery actions, and return the airbase to a normal wartime state
of readiness. Attack warning signal variations may be used in some geographical
regions. If used, Airmen will be notified of the variations before departure
from home station or upon arrival into the region. For example, Alarm Blue is
used instead of Alarm Red in South Korea. Mission-oriented protective postures
are used in conjunction with alarm conditions quickly increase or decrease
protection against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">5.19.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Mission-Oriented Protective Postures. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal19">Mission Oriented Protective Postures levels
(Figure 5.5) are established to quickly communicate required individual
protective equipment and protection levels. The levels are designed to allow a
rapid increase or decrease personal protective equipment in response to
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear attack alarm conditions. The
installation commander determines the initial level, based on mission-oriented
protective posture analysis, and adjusts levels as chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear risks and mission priorities change. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">5.19.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Split Mission-Oriented Protective Posture.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal19">Chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear attacks can affect an entire airbase, but it is also possible that the
attack may only affect specific areas. Split mission-orientated protective
posture is a tactic used to split or divide an installation or operating
location into two or more chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear
zones. Prior to hostilities, planners identify installation chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear zones based on installation geography and
mission. These zones enable the commander to tailor mission-oriented protective
posture levels and alarm conditions within each zone to better reflect the
current hazard and mission priorities. By using split mission-oriented protective
postures the commander can divide the installation into contaminated or
non-contaminated zones, instead of declaring the entire installation
contaminated. This allows the installation to stay operational and effective.
Unit control centers control movement between one zone to another. Personnel
must be aware what alarm condition and mission-oriented protective posture
level applies before entering a zone. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">5.19.4.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Contamination Avoidance Measures. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal19">In chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear threat areas, contamination avoidance is the key to preventing assets
and personnel from becoming contaminated. Implementing quality avoidance
procedures will ensure mission critical assets are available for use when
needed and allow for the survival of the base populace to employ those
resources. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">5.19.5.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Protect Critical Resources. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal19">Prior to a chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear attack, every unit must determine which equipment and
assets can be stored, protected, or covered to protect against chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear contamination. Protecting these vital
resources will minimize or completely remove the requirement to decontaminate
and make the resource available for mission use quickly after an attack. To the
maximum extent possible, aircraft, vehicles, aerospace ground equipment, and
munitions should be covered or moved inside. Bulk supplies should be placed in
shelters or under overhead cover. If equipment cannot be placed under overhead
cover, it must be covered or wrapped with at least one layer of barrier
material to prevent contamination. However, the use at least two layers of
barrier material to cover the top, so any contamination can be easily removed,
safely discarded, and replaced is best. Resource protection provides you with
survival and sustainment measures for operations after chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear warfare events. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">5.19.6.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Facility Protection. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal19">To ensure the inside of facilities do not
become contaminated, occupants will close all windows, doors, and turn off
ventilation systems at the time of the suspected chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear attack. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">5.20. Response. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal25">Response actions during and after a
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear attack are critical to not only
ensure the Air Force mission is continued but more importantly for your
survival. During attacks, the primary focus of the base populace should be
directed toward force survivability to ensure attack warning signals and
mission-oriented protective posture levels are disseminated to the lowest level
rapidly. However, Airmen who recognize an attack in progress should take
immediate action regardless if mass notification has been disseminated. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">5.20.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Notification. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal19">Typically, the command post will disseminate
the attack warning signals via giant voice and other mass notification means.
Alarm signals and mission-oriented protective posture level changes come to the
command post from the Crisis Action Team based on recommendations from the
Emergency Operations Center. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">5.20.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Seek Cover. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal19">Airmen need to use their best judgment
regarding how far they can run during an attack to gain overhead cover or
protection versus taking cover in an open area. Each situation is different, therefore
it is important for Airmen to gain situational awareness and familiarize
themselves with the surrounding environment before an attack takes place. When
Alarm Red is declared, or attack begins without notification, drop to the
ground, don protective mask (if not donned already), crawl to closest available
protection, don remaining individual protective equipment, and immediately
check every member of your unit to make sure they are protected and have donned
the proper equipment. After taking cover remain there until directed otherwise.
If your location becomes too dangerous to maintain, move to a safer area.
Assist injured personnel if possible. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">5.20.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Render Self-Aid and Buddy Care. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal19">Self-aid and buddy care can be performed
immediately, without transition into Alarm Black. Airmen who provide selfaid
and buddy care under fire should do so with caution to ensure they do not
become injured. Each situation is different and handled using good judgment and
risk analysis. </p>

<p class="msonormal39"><span class="calibre3">5.20.4.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Report.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal19">If you observe attacks or enemy personnel
movement, report it up your chain of command immediately. Use the SALUTE
reporting method (Table 5.1) as a quick and effective way to communicate attack
information. SALUTE reports are submitted by the observer upon encountering
enemy activity, to your unit control center or work center through the most
secure means. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">5.21. Recovery. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">Reestablishing the mission is a top priority. Minimizing
the amount of personnel exposed to post attack hazards is critical for mission
continuation and force survivability. Successful base recovery efforts require
a coordinated and integrated approach. The recovery concept involves a combined
effort from personnel trained to operate as a team, using specialized equipment
to spearhead recovery efforts. Immediate actions are necessary to treat
casualties, assess damage, and control contamination. </p>

<p class="msonormal25">5.21.1. <b class="calibre1">Reconnaissance. </b>This
base-wide effort is initiated by the installation commander. The installation
commander will direct when base specialized and unit reconnaissance teams begin
post-attack chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear surveys. Unit control
centers will be directed to release post attack reconnaissance teams to collect
information about the effects of the attack. Post attack reconnaissance teams
or resource owners are responsible for marking and reporting contamination,
including contaminated equipment, to ensure approaching personnel are aware of
the hazard associated with that resource. This will allow those approaching to
don the appropriate protective gear to ensure they are protected before coming
too close to the hazard. Additionally, the post attack reconnaissance team or
resource owner must report information to their unit control center. The unit
control center will forward unit survey information to the Emergency Operations
Center. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">5.21.1.1. If you are not on a reconnaissance
team, your immediate recovery actions include performing immediate
decontamination (if contaminated) and remain under cover unless otherwise
directed. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">5.21.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Post Attack Reporting. </b>Effective communication between
post attack reconnaissance teams and leadership is invaluable. The Emergency
Operations Center is the primary command and control function for collecting
and consolidating post attack information. The Emergency Operations Center
director up channels information and makes recommendations regarding alarm signals
and mission-oriented protective posture levels to the Crisis Action Team based
on the information collected by specialized and unit reconnaissance teams. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">5.21.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Split Mission-Oriented Protective Posture Operations. </b>Commanders
may implement split mission-oriented protective posture for each
pre-established airbase chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear zone
based on the current hazard and mission priorities within that area. Normal
operations continue within areas unaffected by the incident or at lower risk
from the threat. Certain conditions and procedures must be followed when moving
equipment or members between clean and contaminated areas. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">5.21.4.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Zone Transition Points</b>. If movement or travel between
zones is necessary, use zone transition points. Zone transition points are
clear access routes into and out of zones. Zone transition points help to
contain contamination while allowing the movement of people, equipment, and
needed supplies. Unit control centers control movement of their personnel and
equipment between zones. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">5.21.5.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Decontamination.</b> Units will assess and determine what
methods of decontamination, if any, can be reasonably put into action. If a
chemical agent gets on the skin or protective equipment, it must be removed
immediately. The reactive skin decontamination lotion and M295 individual
decontamination kits are the most effective methods of removing chemical
agents. In the absence of an individual decontamination kit, a 5-percent
chlorine solution will remove the chemical agent from equipment and a 0.5
percent chlorine solution will remove agents from the skin. The eyes are very
vulnerable when exposed to nerve and blister agents. If one of these agents
gets in the eyes, the eyes should be irrigated with water. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">5.21.6.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Contamination Control Area.</b> Should personnel become
contaminated with chemical, biological, or radiological agents, they
decontaminate by processing through the contamination control area within 24
hours of contact. If the individual has positive indication of contamination on
their M9 paper, they should report contamination to their unit control center.
Contaminated personnel and equipment should not enter any facility. Unit
control centers will direct personnel to go to the contamination control area
at the appropriate time. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">5.21.7.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Chemically Contaminated Object Rule.</b> The chemically
contaminated object rule for mission oriented protective posture reduction is
often applied by commanders for operations in and near areas with contaminated
objects. The chemically contaminated object rule is a risk management
philosophy designed to warn people of chemically contaminated objects. It does
not direct long duration maintenance in, or on chemically contaminated
resources. Although there is an increased degree of risk when working in these
areas, the rule provides guidance for protecting personnel by specifying the
type of individual protective equipment required. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">5.22. Terrorist Use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological,
and Nuclear Material. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal25">Air Force installations must prepare for the
full range of terrorist threats, including use of chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear weapons. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">5.22.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Terrorist threat or use of chemical, biological, radiological,
and nuclear material is among the emerging transnational threats. The
overwhelming capability of the United States Armed Forces greatly limit
adversary options. Increasingly, nations and terrorist groups are compelled to
make use of asymmetric measures to accomplish their goals. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">5.22.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Traditionally, the perceived threat of terrorism was directed
toward installations in foreign countries. Today, the terrorist use of
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear material is clearly an emerging
worldwide threat. Air Force personnel, equipment, and facilities at home and
abroad are highly visible targets for terrorist attacks. Therefore, chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear threat planning and response are
high-priority. The installation commander is responsible for protecting
installation personnel, facilities, and resources. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">5.22.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Protective measures include evacuation, relocation, exposure
control, contamination control, warning and notification, and
sheltering-in-place. Protective measures are taken in stages equal to the
urgency and nature of the threat; a warning for an increased terrorist attack
or threat forces will increase defense readiness, according to declared force
protection conditions measures. Commanders at overseas locations will ensure
units receive specific instruction and guidance on personnel and resource
protection. Personnel deploying to overseas areas will ensure they are briefed,
before and on arrival, on the enemy attack threat, protective actions, and use
of protective equipment. </p>

<p class="msonormal46"><b class="calibre42">5.23.
Conclusion. </b>The United States Air Force is the most ready and capable air
and space force in the world today. The Air Force’s ability to achieve its
mission hinges on readiness. Each installation is different, but across the Air
Force, one element is constant; as an Airman you have an inherent
responsibility to maintain readiness within your unit and ensure your role in
the installation’s Emergency Management program is executed and ultimately
successful. Air Force members should use emergency management fundamentals in
concert with security and standards of conduct to ensure readiness. </p>

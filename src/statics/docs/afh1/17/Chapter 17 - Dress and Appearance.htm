<p class="msonormal"><b class="calibre1">Chapter 17 </b></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre1">DRESS AND APPEARANCE </b></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 17A—Overview </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">17.1. Introduction: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">17.1.1. Dress and personal appearance standards
immediately identify us as United States Air Force Airmen. These standards are
intended to ensure all Airmen maintain a distinctive, plain, standardized
appearance. Deeply rooted in our Air Force heritage our dress and personal
appearance standards provide visible examples of self-discipline, commitment
and a willingness to set aside individuality for the betterment of the whole.
Wearing the Air Force uniform means carrying on a tradition that identifies the
person as a member of a historical profession, a close-knit society, quietly
assured of his or her competence and professionalism. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">17.1.2. The Air Force uniform developed slowly into
what is worn today. During this evolution, the uniform design changed from one
with many devices and accouterments to one with very few embellishments. The
present Air Force uniform with authorized badges, insignia, and devices is
plain yet distinctive, presenting the appearance of a military professional.
Wearing the Air Force uniform means carrying on a tradition—one that identifies
the person as a member of a historical profession, a close-knit society,
quietly assured of his or her competence and professionalism. This chapter
identifies the most common uniform items and combinations for enlisted members.
<b class="calibre1">Note:</b> Consult AFI 36-2903, <i class="calibre2">Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force
Personnel</i>, for official guidance. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 17B—Individual
Responsibilities </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">All Air Force members in uniform will adhere to
standards of neatness, cleanliness, safety, uniformity, military image, and
present the appearance of a disciplined service member. Air Force members will
procure and maintain all mandatory clothing items, follow local supplements and
procedures, and keep uniforms neat, clean, pressed, buttoned, and properly
maintained. Members will not stand or walk with hands in pockets of any uniform
combination (other than to insert or remove items). While walking in uniform
use of personal electronic media devices, including ear pieces, speaker phones
or text messaging is limited to emergencies or when official notifications are
necessary. Military customs and courtesies take precedence. (<b class="calibre1">Exception:</b> Earphones are authorized
during individual physical training when wearing the physical training uniform.)
Air Force members will not smoke or use smokeless tobacco products, drink, or
eat while walking in uniform. This also applies when Airmen are required to
wear civilian clothes to perform assigned duties. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">17.2. When to Wear the
Uniform: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7">17.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Military
Duties. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal8">As a rule, Air Force members must wear a uniform
while performing military duties. Installation commanders will provide (at no
cost) to enlisted members required organizational and functional items directed
for wear. When members perform duty on other services’ installations, they must
comply with order of dress for that service, provided their standards are not
less restrictive than the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">17.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Traveling. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">Wearing a uniform is optional when a member is
departing from a military airfield on Department of Defense aircraft or United
States government commercial contracted flights. Those who choose to wear
civilian clothing will ensure items are neat, clean, and appropriate for
inflight operations, the mode of travel, and the destination. Examples of
inappropriate clothing include: ripped, torn, frayed, or patched clothing; tank
tops, shorts, short skirts, undergarments worn as outer garment, bathing suits,
and any garments which are revealing or display obscene, profane, or lewd words
or drawings. The Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) is acceptable when traveling
between military installations. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">17.3. Uniform Wear
Restrictions.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal4">Airmen will not wear uniform items that do not meet
Air Force specifications. Additionally, Air Force members may not wear uniform
items to further political activities; for private employment or commercial
interests; while participating in public speeches, interviews, picket lines,
marches or rallies; or at any public demonstration when the perception may
exist that the Air Force sanctions the cause. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3"> </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal10"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3"> </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal11"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3"> </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">17.4. Personal
Grooming Standards: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">17.4.1. <b class="calibre1">Hair. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal13">Hair will be clean, well-groomed, neat and present a
professional appearance. If dyed, hair will look natural. Hair will not contain
an excessive amount of grooming aids, touch the eyebrows, or protrude below the
front band of properly worn headgear. <b class="calibre1">Exception:</b>
Hair may be visible in front of the women’s flight cap. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">17.4.1.1. <b class="calibre1">Men.</b>
Men’s hair must have a tapered appearance on the sides and back, both with and
without headgear. Hair will not exceed 1¼ inches in bulk, regardless of length,
and will not exceed ¼ inch at the natural termination point. Hairstyles that
are extreme, faddish, or violate safety requirements are not permitted. Men’s
hair will not touch the ears; only closely cut or shaved hair on the back of
the neck may touch the collar. The block cut is permitted with tapered
appearance. Men are also authorized cleanly shaven heads, military
high-and-tight, or flattop haircuts. Men will not have any visible items in, or
attached to, their hair. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">17.4.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Women.</b>
Women must style their hair to present a professional appearance. Hair will not
be worn in an extreme or faddish style, or violate safety requirements. Hair
cannot extend below an invisible line drawn parallel to the ground at the
bottom edge of the shirt collar, regardless of length. Hairstyles may include
wear of conservative hairpins, combs, headbands, elastic bands, scrunchies, and
barrettes. However, the items must match the individual’s hair color. Women may
not have shaved heads, military high-and-tight, or flat-top haircuts. Minimum
length is ¼ inch, and hair will not exceed 3 inches in bulk. Long hair worn in
a bun will be secured with no loose ends. When hair is in a ponytail, the hair
must be pulled all the way through the elastic band, hang naturally downward,
and not extend below the collar. Bangs and side-swept hair will not touch the
eyebrows. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">17.4.1.3. <b class="calibre1">Wigs/Hairpieces/Extensions.</b>
Wigs, hairpieces, and extensions must meet the same standards required for
natural hair. They must be of good quality, fit properly, and not exceed limits
stated for natural hair. Synthetic hair is not authorized when prohibited by
safety and mission. Wigs will not be used to cover unauthorized
hairstyles.<span class="calibre3">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal7">17.4.2. <b class="calibre1">Beards,
Mustaches, and Sideburns (Men):</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">17.4.2.1. Beards are not worn except when
authorized by a commander, on the advice of a medical official, for health
reasons. If authorized by the commander, members must keep facial hair trimmed
not to exceed ¼ inch in length. If granted a shaving waiver, members will not
shave any facial hair in a manner as to give a sculptured appearance.
Commanders and supervisors will monitor treatment progress to control shaving
waivers. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">17.4.2.2. Mustaches, if worn, will not extend downward
beyond the lip line of the upper lip or extend sideways beyond a vertical line
drawn upward from both corners of the mouth. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">17.4.2.3. Sideburns, if worn, will be neatly
trimmed and tapered in the same manner as the haircut. They will be straight
and of even width (not flared) and end in a clean-shaven horizontal line. They
will not extend below the bottom of the orifice of the ear opening. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">17.4.3. <b class="calibre1">Cosmetics
(Women).</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal17">Cosmetics must be conservative and in good taste and will
not be worn in field conditions. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">17.4.4. <b class="calibre1">Fingernails. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">Fingernails must be clean, well-groomed, not exceed ¼ inch
in length past tip of finger, and not interfere with duty performance or hinder
proper fit of prescribed safety equipment or uniform items. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">17.4.5. <b class="calibre1">Nail Polish
(Women).</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal17">When worn, nail polish will be a single color that
complements skin tone. Bright red, orange, purple, black, and other extreme
colors are not authorized. Decorations are prohibited, but French manicures are
authorized. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">17.5. Tattoos and
Brands: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7">17.5.1. <b class="calibre1">Unauthorized
Types.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal15">Tattoos and brands, anywhere on the body, that are obscene
or advocate sexual, racial, ethnic, or religious discrimination or commonly
associated with gangs, extremist, and/or supremacist organizations, are
prohibited in and out of uniform. Tattoos and brands that are prejudicial to
good order and discipline or of a nature that tends to bring discredit upon the
Air Force are prohibited in and out of uniform. </p>

<p class="msonormal19"><span class="calibre3"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal20"><span class="calibre3"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal7">17.5.2. <b class="calibre1">Inappropriate
Types.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal21">Excessive tattoos and brands must not be exposed or
visible (includes being visible through the uniform) while in uniform.
Excessive is defined as any tattoo or brand that exceeds ¼ coverage of the
exposed body part and those above the collarbone and readily visible when
wearing an open-collar uniform. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">17.5.3.<b class="calibre1"> Violations. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">Failure to observe the mandatory provisions listed below
are a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice. Violations for
the following types of tattoos and brands are as follows: </p>

<p class="msonormal22">17.5.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Unauthorized.</b>
Any member who obtains unauthorized tattoos will be required to remove them at
his or her own expense. Depending on the circumstances, commanders may seek Air
Force medical support for voluntary tattoo removal. Members who fail to remove
unauthorized tattoos in a timely manner will be subject to involuntary
separation.<span class="calibre3">   </span></p>

<p class="msonormal23">17.5.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Inappropriate.</b>
Members are not allowed to display excessive tattoos that would detract from an
appropriate professional image while in uniform. Commanders will use AFI
36-2903 to assist in determining appropriate military image and acceptability
of tattoos displayed by members in uniform. Air Force members with existing
tattoos that do not meet standards must keep them completely covered using
current uniform items (for example, long-sleeved shirt or blouse, pants or
slacks, dark hosiery, etc.) or volunteer to remove tattoos. Members who do not
comply with these requirements are subject to disciplinary action. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">17.6. Body Piercing. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">Body piercing standards are provided below: </p>

<p class="msonormal12"><b class="calibre1">Note:</b> In
uniform, women are authorized to wear one set of earrings as described in
paragraph 17.15.1. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">17.6.1. <b class="calibre1">In Uniform. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">Members are prohibited from
attaching, affixing, or displaying objects, articles, jewelry, or ornamentation
to or through the ear, nose, tongue, eyebrows, lips, or any exposed body part
(includes visible through the uniform). </p>

<p class="msonormal17">Women may wear one set of earrings. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">17.6.2. <b class="calibre1">In Civilian
Attire: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal8">17.6.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Official
Duty.</b> Members are prohibited from attaching, affixing, or displaying
objects, articles, jewelry, or ornamentation to or through the ear, nose,
tongue, eyebrows, lips, or any exposed body part (includes being visible
through clothing). Women may wear one set of earrings. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">17.6.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Off

affixing, or displaying objects, articles, jewelry, or ornamentation to or
through the ear (males), nose, tongue, eyebrows, lips, or any exposed body part
(includes being visible through clothing).<span class="calibre3"> 
</span></p>

<p class="msonormal25">17.6.3. <b class="calibre1">Imposing More
Restrictive Standards.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal14">Major command commander’s may impose more
restrictive standards for tattoos/brands/body markings and body ornaments, on
or off duty, in those locations where Air Force-wide standards may not be
adequate to address cultural sensitivities (e.g., overseas). Additionally,
major command commanders may impose more restrictive standards on those
performing highly visible special mission requirements or special duty
positions (for example, more restrictive standards for permanently assigned
recruiters, reserve officer training corps cadre, Officer Training School
cadre, United States Air Force Academy cadre, military training instructors,
military training leaders, instructors in any training environment, etc.). </p>

<p class="msonormal18"><b class="calibre1">Note: </b>According
to AFI 36-2903, individuals are prohibited from intentionally pursuing body
alterations or modifications that result in a visible, physical effect that
disfigures, deforms, or otherwise detracts from a professional military image. </p>

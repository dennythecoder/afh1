<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Section
10A—Overview </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.1. Introduction. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">As the old adage “a born leader” implies, those who
lead were intended to, or <i class="calibre3">supposed</i> to, lead since the day they were
born; but how could that be true? Is leadership a characteristic shared only by
those gifted enough to lead or is it simply defined by a person’s position and
authority? After all, given the authority anyone can command, but what sort of
influence does one who merely commands and directs have on those who follow? In
all actuality, leadership is an ability we all can develop and a leader’s
effectiveness is often determined by the actions of those who choose to follow.
Leadership is a delicate mix of art and science requiring people-oriented
attributes, interpersonal communication, and an undeniable character that
motivates, or wills, others to follow. This chapter examines the art and
science of leadership and includes information to assist Airmen in
understanding what leadership is, how it pertains to the Air Force mission, and
why it is important to the institution of airpower. This chapter continues with
a brief explanation of the differences, and interrelationships between
leadership and management, offers an opportunity to assess one’s leadership
qualities, and advice on how to become a more effective leader. Furthermore, it
explains the concept of vision, empowerment, and provides information
pertaining to leadership flexibility and followership. Lastly, we will explore
ways to effectively manage change and mentor followers. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Section
10B—Leadership </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">10.2. The Art and Science of Leadership. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7">Merriam-Webster’s dictionary defines the word <i class="calibre3">lead</i>
as “to guide on a way especially by going in advance” or “to direct on a course
or in a direction.” A leader is considered a person “who directs a military
force or unit” and/or “who has commanding authority or influence.” With this in
mind, we can explain the act of leading in the Air Force as “the art and
science of accomplishing the Air Force mission by motivating, influencing, and
directing Airmen.” This highlights two central elements: (1) the mission;
objective, or task to be accomplished; and (2) the Airmen who will accomplish
it. All aspects of leadership should support the Air Force mission and its
Airmen. Successful leaders recognize that people are the most valuable resource
and, without them; the organization fails. Therefore, the Air Force relies on
its members to develop as leaders for today, and tomorrow. The extent of a
person’s development is dependent on his or her status within the organization
(whether as an officer, enlisted, or civilian), and the level of responsibility
he or she has. Most enlisted members function at the tactical level where their
technical skills are combined with their direct influence on subordinate
members in daily operations and at war. </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><i class="calibre3">“Good leaders
are people who have a passion to succeed….To become successful leaders, we must
first learn that no matter how good the technology or how shiny the equipment,
people-to-people relations get things done in our organizations. People are the
assets that determine our success or failure. If you are to be a good leader,
you have to cultivate your skills in the arena of personal relations.” </i></p>

<p class="msonormal9">General Ronald R. Fogleman Former Air Force Chief
of Staff </p>

<p class="msonormal10">10.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Set the Example. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">Effective leadership takes more than simply “talking
the talk.” Leadership is modeling, or setting the example for others in word
and action. For many, this is considered the toughest part of leading. However,
in order to be successful, leaders must evaluate themselves and work on their
shortcomings. Effective leaders <i class="calibre3">lead</i> rather than drive people. They make
fair and firm decisions that are in the best interest of good order,
discipline, and successful accomplishment of the mission. A leader’s
responsibilities go further than just being responsible for accomplishing the
mission. Effective leaders are not only expected to accomplish the mission, but
to do so with a minimal cost in resources, such as people, materiel, and money.
While no one expects the leader to be perfect, a leader cannot demand the best
from others if he or she cannot perform as expected. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Motivate Intrinsically. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal13">Intrinsic motivation is encouraging others to act,
not because they have to; but because they want to. The Air Force continuously
adapts in new and innovative ways to conduct daily operations, and requires
leaders who can initiate and sustain change. To motivate intrinsically,
consider ways to get others to embrace ideas, strategies, and initiatives.  </p>

<p class="msonormal14"> </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Involvement. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal15">A leader’s success is reflected in the efficiency,
productivity, morale, and enthusiasm demonstrated by the followers and a
leader’s involvement is essential to maximizing worker performance and the
mission. Leaders become a positive influence when they are actively involved in
their Airmen’s careers. Although service members are obligated to “obey the
orders of the President of the U.S. and the orders of the officers appointed
over [them],” they respond more positively and with extra effort to those who
genuinely care about them. In today’s environment of technology and
specialization, most leaders tend to find this environment allows them to
neglect the need of knowing their subordinate members of the organization, and
show sincere concern in their problems, career development, and welfare. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Learning from Failure. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Leadership is all about risks and rewards and
effective leaders realize that failure is possibly one of the greatest learning
tools an organization has for achieving success. With every risk there is the
potential for failure; however, these are the moments which shed light on the
faults that exist within an organization, its processes, and procedures.
Effective leaders realize that learning from failure empowers change and
inspires efforts to improve. Therefore, leaders never fear failure, they
embrace it. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Transparency. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">Direction, decisions, and actions are rarely
challenged if the leader’s intentions are transparent. Transparency is
accomplished by integrating regular communication, shared decision-making,
mutual consensus, and healthy debate. Airmen should know the reason decisions
were made and how that decision will impact them and the organization.
Transparent leaders should not micromanage, give credit where credit is due,
and take accountability when things fail. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.2.6. <b class="calibre1">Flexibility. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">Top-down, authoritative organizations is a classic
example of rigid and stubborn leadership and usually results in resentment and
animosity, especially during times of change. Leaders who are flexible listen
to other points of view, bend when necessary, and are not afraid to change course
if things are not going well. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.2.7. <b class="calibre1">Resilience. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">Leaders at every level within an organization
constantly face challenges, changes, and criticisms. There will always be times
of uncertainty, deviation, turmoil, and at times, conflict. Therefore, resilient
leaders must possess a combination of compassion and thick skin.  </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.2.8.<b class="calibre1"> Accountability. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Good things come to those who are accountable, and
leaders play an important part in ensuring accountability in the workplace.
Promoting accountability in the workplace includes establishing clear roles and
responsibilities, cultivating a sense of pride and ownership among the members
and teams within the organization, providing regular feedback to subordinates,
and leading with integrity and by positive example are all responsibilities of
a leader. Accountability does not focus on the discipline and punishment
associated with being unaccountable; but rather, concentrates on creating, and
sustaining, a continuously learning and always improving organization. </p>

<p class="msonormal18"><i class="calibre3">“Give people
opportunities to take pride in their work and personal growth. People want to
do well at their job; you have to help them do that.” </i></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.3. Leadership Self-Evaluation. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal21">To successfully accomplish the responsibilities of a
position, one must first understand what is expected of them. The following is
a list of questions that offer a perspective as to what is expected of a leader
and assist aspiring leaders develop particular skills. Only the most honest
responses to these questions will reveal one’s definite strengths and potential
weaknesses. Positively and proactively responding to the results will provide
direction upon which to concentrate efforts to improve. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">10.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Do I have the courage to make tough
decisions and stand by them? </p>

<p class="msonormal22">10.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Am I flexible when dealing with changing
situations? </p>

<p class="msonormal22">10.3.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Can I remain enthusiastic and cheerful when
I am confronted with seemingly impossible tasks? </p>

<p class="msonormal22">10.3.4.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Am I willing to do my best with what seems
to be inadequate means? </p>

<p class="msonormal22">10.3.5.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Can I inspire people to achieve outstanding
results? </p>

<p class="msonormal22">10.3.6.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Am I willing to take reasonable risks to
allow my Airmen to grow and become more productive? </p>

<p class="msonormal22">10.3.7.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Am I willing to let my Airmen be creative? </p>

<p class="msonormal22">10.3.8.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Does my manner invite communication? </p>

<p class="msonormal22">10.3.9.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Do I really listen? Can I withhold judgment
until I have all the facts? </p>

<p class="msonormal22">10.3.10.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Am I willing to accept my Airmen’s failures
as my own, yet immediately recognize their successes as theirs? </p>

<p class="msonormal22">10.3.11.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Am I able to do many things at one time?
Can I manage a complex job? </p>

<p class="msonormal22">10.3.12.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Can I carry out orders as well as give
them? </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.4. Advice to Leaders. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal23">There are no secrets or “magic formulas” to
successful leadership. Rather, leadership is an individual and personal choice
and everyone develops their own unique leadership style. Although the best
advice is to just be yourself, all ambitious leaders can always benefit from
the wise words of others. In 1976, while he was Commander in Chief, Pacific Air
Forces, General Louis L. Wilson, Jr., wrote the following timeless advice: </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.4.1.<b class="calibre1"> Be Tough. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal15">Set your standards high and insist that your people
measure up. Have the courage to correct those who fail to do so. In the long
run, your people will be happier. Almost certainly morale will be higher, your
outfit better, and your people prouder. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> Get Out from Behind Your Desk. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">See for yourself what is going on in your work center. Your
Airmen will see that you are interested in their problems, work conditions, and
welfare. Many of your people problems will go away if you practice this point. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.4.3.<b class="calibre1"> Search Out the Problems. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">If you think there are no problems in your organization,
you may be ignorant to problems that are not obvious. The trick is to find
them. Foster an environment that encourages people to bring problems to you. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.4.4.<b class="calibre1"> Find the Critical Path to Success. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal25">Get personally involved in issues on
a priority basis. Let your influence be felt on make-or-break issues in your
organization. Avoid the “activity trap”—do not spend your valuable time on
inconsequential or trivial matters. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">Weigh in where it counts. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.4.5. <b class="calibre1">Be Sensitive. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Listen to your people. Communicate with them and be
perceptive to their needs. Learn to recognize problems and seek out ideas. Be
innovative. Recognize that effective communication involves shared perceptions.
Do not be afraid to empathize when necessary. Listen, listen, and listen! </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.4.6.<b class="calibre1"> Do Not Take Things for Granted. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal26">Do not assume things have been fixed—look for yourself.
Furthermore, do not assume problems will stay fixed. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">The probability is high that fixed problems will recur, so
regularly monitor your processes. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.4.7.<b class="calibre1"> Do Not Alibi. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">Remember, you and your people will never be perfect.
People will make mistakes, so do not be defensive about things that are wrong.
Nothing is more disgusting than the individual who can do no wrong and has an
alibi for anything and everything that goes awry. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.4.8.<b class="calibre1"> Do Not Procrastinate. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Do not put off those hard decisions because you are
not willing to make them today; as they will not be any easier tomorrow. This does
not mean you should make precipitous or unreasonable decisions just to be
prompt. However, once you have arrived at what you believe is correct, get on
with it. Do not block progress. </p>

<p class="msonormal27"> </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.4.9. <b class="calibre1">Do Not Tolerate Incompetence. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">Once people demonstrate laziness, disinterest, or an
inability to get the job done, you must have the courage to terminate their
assignments. You cannot afford to do less. On the other hand, when your people
are doing good work, recognize the good work and encourage them. Certainly they
will do even better. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.4.10. <b class="calibre1">Be Honest. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal29">When talking to your people be
candid and insist that they do likewise. They set their behavior patterns based
upon your example. Nothing is more disastrous than garbled information,
half-truths, and falsifications. Make sure your people know where you stand on
this matter. Encourage them to come to you if they have questions about what is
going on in the unit. You must create an atmosphere of trust and confidence.
Finally, be honest with yourself—do not gimmick reports and figures to make
things look good on paper. Advice from a successful leader can be a beneficial
tool to the aspiring leader, but where the aspiring leader applies this tool
will determine his or her success. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">The perfect place to start is Air Force standards. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.5. Air Force Standards. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Air Force standards of conduct, discipline, and
customs and courtesies reflect the Air Force’s broad heritage and traditions.
Air Force leaders must not only know these standards, they must enforce them.
While current Department of Defense and Air Force policies provide specific
guidance on standards, leaders must be familiar with the following: </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.5.1.<b class="calibre1"> Mission. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal15">The Air Force’s mission is to fly, fight, and win…in
air, space, and cyberspace. To achieve strategic, operational, and tactical
objectives unhindered by time, distance, and geography; the Air Force employs
six distinctive capabilities of Air and Space Superiority, Global Attack, Rapid
Global Mobility, Precision Engagement, Information Superiority, and Agile
Combat Support. The three Air Force Core Values of Integrity First, Service
before Self, and Excellence in All We Do, enables Airmen to effectively execute
their responsibilities and accomplish the mission.  </p>

<p class="msonormal22">10.5.2.<b class="calibre1"> Oath. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">Upon entering the Air Force, each member voluntarily takes
a sworn oath of enlistment. With every oath, enlisted members reaffirm their
belief and public commitment to the following: </p>

<p class="msonormal30"><i class="calibre3">I, (name), do
solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of
the U.S. against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same, and that I will obey the orders of the President of
the U.S. and the orders of the officers appointed over me according to
regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.5.3. <b class="calibre1">Way of Life. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">Airmen are on duty 24 hours a day, 365 days a year;
and if so directed by a competent authority, must report for duty at any time,
at any location, for as long as necessary to complete the task at hand. Due to
the importance of the Air Force mission, the dangers associated with military
service, and the national and international influence and potential
implications relevant to global operations; the Air Force enforces more
restrictive rules and elevated standards than those found in the civilian
community. Individuals unable to maintain these higher standards, or are deemed
not compatible with military service will not be retained in the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.5.4. <b class="calibre1">Chain of Command. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal15">The chain of command provides the authority,
communications, and control necessary to accomplish the missionrelated tasks at
every echelon of the Air Force. Each level is responsible for all lower levels
and accountable to all higher levels. The chain will not work without loyalty
at every level. The key to an effective chain of command is trusting the system
and resolving issues at the lowest possible level.  </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.5.5. <b class="calibre1">Conduct. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal31">The Air Force’s mission is critical to national
security, global stability, and international relations. Therefore, each member
has specific responsibilities for accomplishing their part in the mission.
Airmen carry out orders, perform specific duty-related tasks, and uphold Air
Force standards. Supervisors enforce these standards and ensure their Airmen
understand and fulfill them at all times. Standards of conduct apply to both
on-duty and off-duty behavior. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.5.6. <b class="calibre1">Professional Relationships. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">To maintain a successful and effective military
organization, the Air Force depends on professional relationships</p>

<p class="msonormal28">among all its members (both military and civilian).
All interactions and relationships must support the mission and operational
effectiveness of the Air Force. Officers and Enlisted alike must ensure their
relationships with coworkers, superiors, and subordinates do not portray
favoritism or impropriety. Excessive socialization and undue familiarity,
whether real or perceived, degrades morale, team cohesion, and leadership
effectiveness. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.6. Leadership Versus Management. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal32"><i class="calibre3">"Leaders are
people who do the right thing. Managers are people who do things right."</i><b class="calibre1">
</b></p>

<p class="msonormal33">Warren
G. Bennis, Ph.D. </p>

<p class="msonormal34">Founding Chair, The Leadership Institute,
University of Southern California </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.6.1. <b class="calibre1">Which Is More Important?</b>  </p>

<p class="msonormal11">Leadership and management are simply not the same
thing. Successful organizations include and depend on elements of control,
trust, administration, development, standardization, innovation, compliance,
and inspiration. Leadership and management go hand in hand in producing these
elements which promote mission success. Throughout military history, there have
been accounts of leadership and management in action. For instance, during the
D-Day Invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944, some believe this invasion was an
effective use of management which moved the U.S. and coalition forces onto the
beaches, and the inspirational leadership is what moved them forward. So which
is more important? </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.6.2.<b class="calibre1"> Roles of Leadership and Management. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">To better understand the roles of leadership and
management, consider them in terms of behavior, personal characteristics, and
organizational situation. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.6.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Behavior: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">10.6.2.1.1. Managerial behaviors focus on building
organizational mechanisms that mesh together like the parts of a complex
timepiece whereas leadership behaviors concentrate on effectively moving the
hands of the timepiece to display the correct time. The behavioral focus of
each is clearly important; but, while the manager may be preoccupied with the
precision of the process, the leader concentrates on the inertial forces that
affect the process. </p>

<p class="msonormal35"><i class="calibre3">"Management
is getting people to do what needs to be done. Leadership is getting people to
want to do what needs to be done.” </i></p>

<p class="msonormal24">The words of Field Marshal Sir William Slim, who led the
British Fourteenth Army in the conquest of Burma in World War II, are worthy of
note:<i class="calibre3"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal39"><i class="calibre3">“Leadership is
of the spirit, compounded of personality and vision. Management is of the mind,
more a matter of accurate calculation, statistics, methods, timetables, and
routines." </i></p>

<p class="msonormal40"><span class="calibre4">                              </span>                                                                                                    Field

<p class="msonormal11">10.6.2.1.2. Managers use the management process to
control people by pushing them in the right direction. Leaders motivate and
inspire people to keep moving in the right direction by satisfying human needs.
In order to achieve a vision, leaders tailor their behavior toward their
followers’ needs for achievement, sense of belonging, recognition, self-esteem,
and control over their lives. Bennis offers an appropriate summary of this
behavioral characteristics comparison in Figure 10.1. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">10.6.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Personal Characteristics. </b>Figure
10.1 also illustrates a comparison of successful leaders and managers, as
researched by Professor Robert White, Indiana University. Neither type of
behavior is exclusively positive or negative. Figure 10.1 suggests that leaders
must have a grasp of management and leadership skills to be successful.
Moreover, the two cannot (and should not) be separated. In other words, leadership
is an art that includes management. The best managers tend to become good
leaders because they develop leadership abilities and skills through practicing
good management techniques. Similarly, seldom is there an effective leader who
is not also a good manager. Successful leaders humanize their management skills
with inspiration, empowerment, and vision through charisma. </p>

<p class="msonormal53">10.6.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Organizational Situation.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal54">10.6.2.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>What are the organizational
implications of management and leadership? Leaders launch and steer the
organization toward the pursuit of goals and strategies while managers ensure
the resources needed are readily available and efficiently used. Managers are responsible
for organizing projects, staffing positions with qualified individuals,
communicating plans, delegating responsibilities, and devising systems to
monitor implementation. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">Leadership supports these actions by aligning the
personnel’s needs, wants, emotions, and aspirations with the task. They
understand the vision are committed and encourage others. (<b class="calibre1">Note:<i class="calibre3"> </i></b>The
concept of vision is discussed in paragraph 10.8.) </p>

<p class="msonormal55">10.6.2.3.2. To be successful, an organization needs
both leadership and management. For an organization, strong leadership with
weak management is no better, and sometimes worse, than the opposite. The
challenge is to achieve a balance of strong leadership and capable management.
While not the most effective approach, a peacetime military can survive with
good administration and management up and down the hierarchy, coupled with good
leadership concentrated at the top. On the other hand, a wartime force must
have competent leadership at all levels, particularly at the tactical level of
war. Good management brings a degree of order and consistency to key issues
like readiness, availability, and sustainment. However, no one has yet figured
out how to manage people into battle. They must be led. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.7. Leadership Qualities:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.7.1.<b class="calibre1"> Positive Attitude. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">Leaders must demonstrate the attitude they hope to
see emulated by their followers. In doing so, this same attitude will be more
easily adopted by their Airmen. Enthusiasm is contagious and can deliver energy
to all aspects of organizational operations. Although encouragement is normally
considered an action, encouragement is actually attitude related. The
inclination to encourage Airmen, as well as oneself, is a powerful motivator
and satisfies human needs. Effective leaders constantly embrace positive goals
and display a positive attitude. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.7.2.<b class="calibre1"> Values. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">The degree to which trust, loyalty, and integrity
are present in the leadership of an organization directly relates to the
organization’s effectiveness. Leadership is the capacity to generate and
sustain trust, and trust is dependent upon reliability. Indicators of
reliability, such as punctual attendance at all meetings, prompt attention to
correspondence, and meeting task deadlines translate into the level of trust
people have in one another. Trust must also be balanced with a willingness to
remove people who cannot be trusted and to make tough decisions when necessary.
While the right decision is not always the easiest decision, Airmen respect
leaders for doing the right thing and reward leadership with their own
trustworthiness and loyalty. Like trust, the doors of loyalty swing both ways.
Leaders cannot demand unwavering loyalty of their followers without being
willing to return loyalty to them. Integrity is a consistent and honest
demonstration of personal commitment to the organization and its vision.
Therefore, leaders should be ever mindful of the ramifications of their
behavior and strive to epitomize the Air Force core value of <i class="calibre3">Integrity First</i>.
</p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.7.3. <b class="calibre1">Character. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">The character traits of effective leaders include
charisma, compassion, and courage. Effective leadership is a combination of
competence and character. Lack of character, however, will most often prevent
individuals from becoming great leaders. </p>

<p class="msonormal56"><i class="calibre3">"But what
if the leader, government-appointed or self-appointed, shouts, “Follow me!” and
no one does? When do men sometimes follow him, and shout enthusiastically too?
Something called “character” must be apparent in the leader. The followers must
like him and want to be like him, or want him to like them. When it’s over,
they want him—private, sergeant, lieutenant, or even General </i></p>

<p class="msonormal57"><i class="calibre3">Eisenhower—to clap
them on the shoulder and say he’s proud of them." </i></p>

<p class="msonormal16">10.7.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Charisma.</b><i class="calibre3"> </i>According to
Webster, charisma is a special characteristic of leadership that inspires
allegiance and devotion. Charisma can be effective, but is not a cure-all for
leadership needs. German sociologist Max Weber’s research noted that charisma
is often contrary to authority; superiors consequently frown on it.
Additionally, once it becomes “old hat” to Airmen, charisma’s attraction and
powers wane. Further, Airmen can easily spot disingenuous charisma, a
characteristic that eventually erodes mission effectiveness. </p>

<p class="msonormal60">10.7.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Compassion. </b>Compassion is the
sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others.
Coupled with understanding, compassion is an important leadership trait.
Because the human psyche bruises easily, most Airmen withhold their true
feelings, often to the point of distress. Additionally, if Airmen do not share
their feelings, NCOs will struggle to help Airmen improve their performance.
Compassion promotes healthy, open, and honest communication and provides the
stimulus to discuss one’s inner thoughts and feelings. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">10.7.3.3. <b class="calibre1">Courage.</b> Courage can take many
forms. Leaders must demonstrate both moral and physical courage not only in
combat and in high-risk situations, but in day-to-day life. Leadership requires
the courage to address substandard performance or unacceptable behavior, to welcome
new ideas, do what is ethically right when others prefer to do otherwise, and
to be honest. Acts of courage inspires others to be courageous as well and
helps them to maintain composure in stressful situations and provides the
stimulus and encouragement to endure hardships. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.7.4.<b class="calibre1"> Credibility. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal15">Credibility is the quality of being trusted and
believed in. Credible leaders must exercise and demonstrate humility,
commitment to the organization and mission, and optimize operations by tapping
into the unique strengths of each team member. Occasionally, leaders must “get
their hands dirty” alongside their followers which also bolsters credibility.
However, credibility is very fragile and takes years to earn through
persistent, consistent, and patient leadership and can easily be lost with one
thoughtless action, decision, or behavior. In the present era, leaders are
challenged to demonstrate their credibility even more. Successful leaders earn
credibility through leading by example and taking responsibility. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">10.7.4.1.<b class="calibre1"> Leading by Example.<i class="calibre3"> </i></b>Leaders
lead by example. Leaders can be positive role models when they lead by example
and pay attention to what they believe is important. Through positive behavior,
leaders show others that they live by their values. They reinforce their
credibility when they do not dwell on the effort they have put forth. Plus,
Airmen are impressed when leaders do not exhibit undue strain in difficult
circumstances. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.7.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> Taking Responsibility. </b>A crucial element
of a leader’s credibility is taking responsibility not only for his or her
individual actions, but also for those of the Airmen. </p>

<p class="msonormal61"><i class="calibre3">"All this
has been my fault. It is I who have lost this fight, and you must help me out
of it the best way you can." </i></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.8. Vision. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal64">Air Force leaders must have a collective vision; a
vision that empowers, inspires, challenges, and motivates followers to the
highest levels of commitment and a continuous process improvement environment.
Therefore, we must embrace and communicate the Air Force Smart Operations for
the 21st Century vision. The vision for Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st
Century is to establish a continuous process improvement environment in which
all Airmen are actively eliminating waste and continuously improving processes.
These improvements must be centered on the core missions Airmen are responsible
for conducting; specifically to maintain the asymmetric advantages and
capabilities the Air Force delivers in air, space, and cyberspace. We need to
ensure we are also driving efficiencies and improvements across the board.
Therefore, we must use the right tools and techniques to see and attack
problems and leverage opportunities for improvement and employ our greatest
resource: innovative, dedicated Airmen.<span class="calibre18"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.8.1.<b class="calibre1"> What Is Vision?  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">10.8.1.1. Vision is helping people believe they can
accomplish their goals in the anticipation of a better future as a result of
their own efforts. Inspiration is one way to convey vision. To better
understand this concept, consider the following examples: President Franklin D.
Roosevelt’s announcement in May 1940 that the U.S. would produce 50,000 planes
a year, and President John F. Kennedy’s 1961 announcement of the U.S. intention
to put a man on the moon within the decade. Both goals were breathtaking, perhaps
impossible by most standards, and yet both were achieved. In each case, the
dramatic announcement and the infectious inspiration bred helped achieve the
goal. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">10.8.1.2. The ability to form mental images of a
possible outcome and to translate these images into a reality through
leadership and action is a unique feature of the human brain. A leader should
constantly anticipate the influences, trends, and demands that affect the
vision over the next month, year, even decade. Unfortunately, a common leadership
error is to become preoccupied with the present at the expense of the future.
To be of realistic value, the vision must be logical, deductive, and plausible.
Vision must be specific enough to provide real guidance to people, but
unbounded enough to encourage initiative and demonstrate relevancy to a variety
of conditions. Leaders without vision are doomed to perpetuate complacency.
They fail to prosper because they continue doing things as they have always
been done. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.8.2.<b class="calibre1"> Implementing the Vision. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">While senior leadership has the authority and
responsibility to change the system as a whole, leaders at lower levels direct
supervisors and subordinates to tasks more appropriate to the challenges of the
new age. To do this, the leaders must communicate the vision to the unit, shop,
or work center. Leaders are responsible for bolstering their Airmen’s courage
and understanding. However, launching a vision cannot be a single effort. Those
who work for and with the leader are excellent sources of ideas. Leaders can
prepare the organization for potential changes to come and disarm resistance to
change by soliciting suggestions and promoting wide participation. <i class="calibre3">"A
great leader’s courage to fulfill his vision comes from passion, not
position."</i> </p>

<p class="msonormal65">John
C. Maxwell </p>

<p class="msonormal66"><i class="calibre3">The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</i> </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.8.3.<b class="calibre1"> The Downside. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">Even a clearly articulated and achievable vision may
flounder if appropriate resource management and leadership practices do not
accompany the vision. Sometimes the vision becomes an obsession and, as a
result, adversely affects leader and follower judgment. What is crucial about
the vision is not the originality, but, how well the vision serves the mission
requirements, strategic goals of the unit, and the Air Force as a whole. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.8.4.<b class="calibre1"> Maintaining the Vision. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">Every leader needs to establish an enduring vision.
A vision that meets the organization’s needs at the time of implementation,
over time, is unlikely to be applicable without changes. There is no regular
schedule for vision revision. However, a wise leader does not wait for the
alarm to sound before considering alternatives. Rather, the vision-forming
process should be continual. Leaders should encourage personnel of all ranks,
levels, and occupations to help articulate the vision. The experience will
prove invaluable as unit members are promoted into more responsible,
higher-level positions and continue to build an effective path to the future.
On the other hand, the vision should not be arbitrarily modified. If the vision
works and is consistent with environmental and technological developments, the
vision should be affirmed and supported. As technology and our environment
continue to evolve, our vision and leadership style must keep pace. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.9. Empowerment: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.9.1.<b class="calibre1"> Empowerment Defined. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">Empowerment is a force that energizes people and
provides responsibility, ownership, and control over the work they perform.
Some individuals interpret empowerment as merely the delegation of authority.
Delegation is not empowerment; however, effective empowerment does require good
delegation. Assigning people tasks, along with the freedom and authority needed
to creatively accomplish the tasks, is the essence of empowerment.
Consequently, empowerment is often confused with participative leadership—emphasizing
sensitivity to needs, involving people, and asking people for help. While
empowerment includes these concepts, empowerment goes much further and allows
workers to become stakeholders in the organization’s vision. Once they are
committed to this vision, organization members begin to participate in shaping
and fashioning the vision into a shared vision. This synergistically developed
vision motivates people to focus on the future and what the future holds, not
simply because they <i class="calibre3">must</i>, but because they <i class="calibre3">want</i> to. For this
approach to be successful, leaders must always be open and receptive to ideas
and suggestions that could improve or refine the organization’s vision. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.9.2.<b class="calibre1"> Essence of Empowerment. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal15">10.9.2.1. The essence of empowerment requires both
leaders and followers to identify with their respective share of the
organization’s goals. The military is traditionally an authoritarian
organization. The need for rapid decisionmaking and crisis response normally
necessitates a traditional hierarchical framework. However, complex
hierarchical frameworks do not always result in rapid decisions. Furthermore,
the continual transformation of leaderfollower roles is heralding an
environment that allows both leaders and followers to more effectively realize
organizational goals and objectives. </p>

<p class="msonormal67">10.9.2.2. Effective empowerment is not new. Truly
great leaders of the past never directly told their people how to do their
jobs. Rather, they explained what needed to be done and established a playing
field that allowed their people to achieve success on their own. Consequently,
the follower’s success became a success for the leader and the organization as
well. While the responsibility for task completion may be on the leader’s
shoulders, the burden of getting the job done is shared by all. Therefore, the
adage, “It’s lonely at the top,” is applicable to a leader who does not
recognize the strengths of his or her people. Airmen can supply the details and
express concerns that help overcome barriers to achieving visionary goals and
mission accomplishment. When leaders solicit input, they discover the
knowledge, interest, and parameters of support. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.9.3.<b class="calibre1"> Guidelines to Empowerment. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal68">Empowerment enhances organizational performance by
promoting contributions from every member of the organization. Trust is the
cornerstone of the mutually dependent relationship shared by leaders and
followers. Therefore, the leader must be flexible and patient in introducing
empowerment. By delegating decisions to those closest to the issues and by
allowing Airmen flexibility in how they implement the vision, the leader
successfully allows others to take ownership of the vision and experience pride
in achieving the vision. Thus, the leader must maintain a firm grip on
operational requirements and strategic planning. The leader must also realize
that not everyone is willing or ready to accept the reins of empowerment. To
realize their potential in fulfilling the vision, empowered followers need sufficient
training on the task at hand. Otherwise, they are doomed to fail. On the other
hand, Airmen who have expert knowledge in a particular field should be
encouraged to use this knowledge and improve the vision where and when
possible. Recognition is a key factor in perpetuating improvements. Hence, an
important facet of empowerment is the appropriate recognition of contributions
Airmen make to maximize mission success.<i class="calibre3"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.9.4.<b class="calibre1"> Potential Pitfalls. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal55">Empowerment is frequently misunderstood and applied
inappropriately. Empowerment is often associated with a laissez-faire style of
leadership (abdicating responsibility for tasks to Airmen who are left to their
own devices). This fire-and-forget approach to empowerment demonstrates a total
absence of leadership. Conversely, empowerment is a leader-subordinate
relationship that requires even more refined supervisory skills than
traditional autocracy. People continually need direction, knowledge, resources,
and support. Furthermore, empowerment and vision cannot be imposed. To do so
would breed compliance rather than commitment. From an application standpoint,
many leaders seek consensus as a means to empower their people. However, while
consensus is assumed to be good because consensus represents what the group as
a whole wants, consensus is usually safe and free of innovative ideas.
Additionally, consensus can divert an organization from their true goal or
vision. The adage that “a camel is a horse built by consensus” is not so
farfetched. Leaders do not seek consensus—they build it. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.10. Learning: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.10.1.<b class="calibre1"> The Leader’s Responsibilities. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">Life in the military incorporates a perpetual
requirement for continued training and education. Effective leaders must accept
the responsibility of being both a master student and master teacher and should
influence others by example. Training is used to communicate and implement the
organization’s vision and values at the supervisory and subordinate levels.
Training is not only fundamental in focusing the organization’s strategic
vision, but also helps develop the capabilities of the Airmen who make the
vision a reality. Both formal and informal training do more than augment a
unit’s level of technical expertise. By providing the skills Airmen need to be
successful, organizations realize increased energy and motivation. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.10.2.<b class="calibre1"> Fostering Growth. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">10.10.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Leaders foster professional growth
by insisting their Airmen focus attention on the aspects of a situation,
mission, or project they control. This is not to say tasks should be limited in
scope or challenge. On the contrary, some adventure should be an integral part
of every job. In order to motivate Airmen to learn and excel, leaders should
provide challenging and enlightening experiences. Consequently, some supervisors
want to tell an Airman what to do to improve. While this may impress the
follower with the leader’s knowledge, telling an Airman what to do to improve
creates an unnecessary dependence on the leader and critically limits the
follower’s value of the experience. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">10.10.2.2. The role of the leader in fostering
growth is to identify and analyze knowledge and improvement opportunities. This
will ensure advancements are permanent and pervasive, not temporary and
specific. Leaders encourage the learning process by formally recognizing
individual and unit successes, no matter how large or small. A more formal and
direct way for the leader to encourage the subordinate to learn is by setting
standards. Standards have the multiple effects of providing feedback to the leader
on performance, ensuring quality control of unit output, and giving Airmen a
goal and inspiration for developing and performing to do their best. </p>

<p class="msonormal69"><i class="calibre3">People want to
know what is expected of them. No one goes to work and says, “I am going to do
a lousy job today.” People work to succeed, and they need to know how you
measure that success. Allow for a few mistakes because people must be given the
latitude to learn. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.10.3.<b class="calibre1"> Developing Airmen: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.10.3.1. To develop Airmen, a leader must: </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.10.3.1.1. Train replacements (the next generation). </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.10.3.1.2. Develop an understanding of roles and
responsibilities. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.10.3.1.3. Be an advisor and mentor. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.10.3.1.4. Provide an opportunity for growth and
promotion. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.10.3.1.5. Clarify expectations. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.10.3.1.6. Strengthen service identity. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.10.3.1.7. Allow Airmen to make decisions and experience
leadership. </p>

<p class="msonormal71">10.10.3.1.8. Encourage and facilitate formal education. </p>

<p class="msonormal28">10.10.3.2. An important milestone in any Airman’s
development process is to experience a significant challenge early in his or
her career. Developing Airmen for leadership positions requires much work over
long periods of time. Identifying people with leadership potential early in
their careers and then determining the appropriate developmental challenges for
them is the first step. Leaders must recognize and diagnose the capabilities of
each Airman in their unit or organization. Those capabilities may include any
skills, talents, experiences, personality temperaments, etc., the Airman may
have that can contribute to current and future mission accomplishment. Leaders
must also diagnose the developmental needs of Airmen, then assist them with
personal and professional developmental needs that fulfill current or future
job/role and responsibilities. Professional development needs may include
off-duty education, Professional Military Education, specific skill training,
additional training, professional development seminars/courses, and
communication skills, etc. Personal developmental needs may include
relationships, interpersonal skills, communication skills, supervisory skills,
off-duty education, etc. Today’s effective leaders had opportunities early in
their careers that required them to lead, take risks, and learn from their
triumphs and failures. In business, successful corporations do not wait for
leaders to come along. Rather, they actively seek out people with leadership
potential and expose them to career experiences designed to develop their
skills. However, leaders must caution themselves against becoming preoccupied
with finding and developing <i class="calibre3">young</i> leadership potential. Leaders must
guard against overlooking the “late bloomer” whose leadership potential was not
evident early on. A late bloomer’s combination of maturity, experience, and
untapped potential is a valuable asset to any organization.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.10.4.<b class="calibre1"> Dealing with Setbacks: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.10.4.1. To learn and improve, people need to be
encouraged to try new things; sometimes their efforts will fail. A fundamental
aspect of empowerment is acknowledging the right to fail. Obviously, some
common sense is required. There can be no tolerance for violating regulations,
jeopardizing safety, or failing due to a lack of effort. However, if the
setback is the result of a failed attempt, applaud the initiative and dissect
the setback so the Airman can learn from what went wrong. Unfortunately, the
fear of failure prevents many otherwise capable individuals from pursuing their
creativity and innovation. An Airman’s dedication to improving his or her
abilities is quite a valuable asset to an organization. Followers must remain
optimistic, even in times of adversity. </p>

<p class="msonormal72">10.10.4.2. Some people believe the key to success is
to avoid failure. Consequently, they stay with the things they know and do well
rather than risk failure by trying something new. The surest way to stifle
creativity and innovation is to allow fear to perpetuate complacency. Airmen
count on the experience and understanding of strong leaders in dealing with
setbacks. There is no substitute for being able to say to an Airman, “I know
what you’re feeling, I’ve experienced similar setbacks. Here is how I chose to
deal with the situation, and these are what the consequences of my actions
were. Reflecting back on the situation, here is what I would do now if I had
the chance to do things over.” </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.11. Dealing with Change: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7">10.11.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Leaders must be the chief
transformation officers in their organizations and learn everything there is to
know about the change before dealing with the change can even take place.
Furthermore, they must learn how to deal with the emotions that result from the
chaos and fear associated with change. Putting new processes in place is not
enough. The people supporting these processes must be motivated to meet the
challenge and support the change. To achieve that, leaders must maintain a
clear understanding of the present and a clear focus on the future. </p>

<p class="msonormal73">10.11.2. The leader must create an organizational
climate conducive to change by explaining the limitations or shortfalls of the
present process and the possibilities and benefits of the proposed change.
Next, the leader must facilitate the change itself: walk Airmen through the
change, explain the details, and answer questions. Finally, the leader should
reward those who comply with the change and refocus those who do not.
Tough-minded optimism is the best quality a leader can demonstrate when coping
with change. Leaders coping with change should: </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.11.2.1. Involve people in the change process. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.11.2.2. Fully explain the reason for change. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.11.2.3. View change positively. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.11.2.4. Create enthusiasm for the change. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.11.2.5. Facilitate change (avoid forcing it). </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.11.2.6. Be open-minded and experiment with alternatives.

<p class="msonormal24">10.11.2.7. Seek out and accept feedback. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.11.2.8. Never get complacent. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.12. The Air Force Core Values. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal74">The Air Force core values are the bedrock of
leadership in the Air Force. The core values are a statement of those
institutional values and principles of conduct that provide the moral framework
within which military activities take place. The professional Air Force ethic
consists of three fundamental and enduring values of integrity, service, and
excellence. This ethic is the set of values that guides the way Air Force
members live and perform. Success hinges on the incorporation of these values
into the character of every Airman. In today’s time—compressed, dynamic, and
dangerous operational environment—an Airman does not have the luxury of
examining each issue at leisure. He or she must fully internalize these values
to be able to automatically act in all situations to maintain integrity, to
serve others before self, and to perform with excellence and encourage others
to do the same. The Air Force core values—Integrity First, Service Before Self,
and Excellence In All We Do—represent the commitment each Airman makes when
joining the Air Force. These values provide a foundation for leadership,
decision-making, and success, whatever the level of assignment, difficulty, or
dangers presented by the mission. </p>

<p class="msonormal75"><i class="calibre3">All Airmen are
men and women of character. Our enduring Air Force Core Values provide a
touchstone as we rise to meet current and future challenges, threats, and
opportunities. As America’s Airmen, it is imperative that we maintain the moral
high ground</i>—<i class="calibre3">our Nation depends on it. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal76">Michael
W. Wynne  </p>

<p class="msonormal77">Former
Secretary of the Air Force<i class="calibre19"> Core Values help those who join us to understand
right from the outset what’s expected of them. Equally important, they provide
all of us, from Airman to four-star general, with a touchstone—a guide in our
own conscience—to remind us of what we expect from ourselves. We have wonderful
people in the Air Force. But we aren’t perfect. Frequent reflection on the core
values helps each of us refocus on the person we want to be and the example we
want to set.</i> </p>

<p class="msonormal78">General Michael E. Ryan, Retired Former Air Force
Chief of Staff </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.12.1.<b class="calibre1"> Integrity First. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal15">Integrity is the willingness to do what is right
even when no one is looking. Integrity is the "moral compass," the
inner voice, the voice of self-control, and the basis for the trust imperative
in today’s Air Force. Integrity is the single most important part of character.
Integrity makes Airmen who they are and what they stand for, and is as much a
part of their professional reputation as their ability to fly or fix jets,
operate the computer network, repair the runway, or defend the airbase. Airmen
must be professional, in and out of uniform. Integrity is not a suit that can
be taken off at night or on the weekend or worn only when important to look
good. Instead, what makes integrity critical is when we least expect to be
tested. People are watching us, not to see us fail but to see us live up to
their expectations; anything less risks putting the heritage and reputation of
the Air Force in peril. Integrity is the ability to hold together and properly regulate
all the elements of one’s personality. A person of integrity acts on
conviction, demonstrating impeccable self-control without acting rashly.
Integrity encompasses many characteristics indispensable to Airmen.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal79"><i class="calibre3">There will be
demands upon your ability, upon your endurance, upon your disposition, upon
your patience…just as fire tempers iron into fine steel so does adversity
temper one’s character into firmness, tolerance and determination. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.12.2.<b class="calibre1"> Service before Self: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">10.12<b class="calibre1">.</b>2.1. As an Air Force core value,
service before self represents an abiding dedication to the age-old military
virtue of selfless dedication to duty, including putting one’s life at risk if
called to do so. The service-before-self value deals with accepting
expeditionary deployments and assignments. Service before self does not mean
service before family. Airmen have a duty to their families just as strong as
that to the service. The difference is there are times when service to the
nation requires subordinating the needs of the family. Their responsibilities
to their families include ensuring they are cared for when Airmen are home or
deployed. </p>

<p class="msonormal28">10.12<b class="calibre1">.</b>2.2. This value also demands that each
Airman keep faith in the system. This does not imply that we follow our leaders
blindly and not sometimes question what we are doing. Airmen must always place
trust in the processes, procedures, and other Airmen to get the job done in the
right way. Airmen must understand that an organization can only achieve
excellence in an atmosphere free from fear, unlawful discrimination, sexual
harassment, intimidation, hazing, or unfair treatment. Airmen must show loyalty
to their leadership, fellow Airmen, and the Air Force as a whole, including
showing commitment to the Constitution, military chain of command, and to both
the President and Secretary of Defense.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.12.3.<b class="calibre1"> Excellence In All We Do: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal13">10.12.3.1. This core value demands Airmen constantly
strive to perform at their best. They should always strive to exceed standards
objectively based on mission needs. This demands a continuous search for new
and innovative ways to accomplish the mission without jeopardizing morale and
loyalty. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">10.12.3.2. Personally, Airmen seek out and complete
developmental education. They constantly work hard to stay in their best
physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and moral shape. Airmen continue to
enhance their professional competencies and are diligent to maintain their job
skills, knowledge, and personal readiness at the highest possible levels. They
understand that when members of an organization work together to successfully
reach a common goal, excellence is achieved and no Airman wins the fight alone.
Each organization must foster a culture that emphasizes a team mentality while
simultaneously maintaining standards and accomplishing the mission. Realizing
that people are our most precious resource, Airmen are responsible for ensuring
they are trained, fit, focused, and ready to accomplish the mission safely and
effectively. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Section
10C—Followership and Mentoring </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.13. Introduction. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal73">Preoccupation with leadership often prevents us from
considering the nature and importance of followership. At some point, everyone
is a follower. Few leaders became successful without first having learned
followership skills. Therefore, leaders must recognize the importance and
qualities of followership, the needs of followers, and ways to promote
followership. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.14. Importance of Followership. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal74">Today’s leader has the almost impossible task of
keeping up with ever-changing technology while coping with leadership demands.
In many cases, the leader is not the most technically skilled person in the
unit. He or she likely has personnel with advanced technological skills and
capabilities. People are our most valuable resource. Today’s junior members
have knowledge, skills, and abilities that open unlimited opportunities to
maximize work center effectiveness. Therefore, leaders must tap into this
resource by nurturing and developing their Airmen’s capabilities and fostering
their willingness to improve organizational effectiveness. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.15. Qualities of Followership. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal22">The following 10 qualities are essential for good
followership. However, this list is neither inflexible nor exhaustive: </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.15.1.<b class="calibre1"> Organizational Understanding. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">Effective followers must be able to see how their work
contributes to the organization’s big picture. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.15.2.<b class="calibre1"> Decision-making. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">Followers must be able to make sound decisions using a team
approach. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.15.3.<b class="calibre1"> Communication Skills. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">Followers must have effective communication skills. These
skills are crucial when working in a team environment, especially when
providing feedback to team members. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.15.4.<b class="calibre1"> Commitment. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">Being able to successfully contribute to the organization,
while striving to achieve personal goals, requires a strong level of follower
commitment. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.15.5.<b class="calibre1"> Problem Solving. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">A broader scope of responsibility to help identify and
resolve work center problems requires followers to share their knowledge,
skills, and experience. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.15.6.<b class="calibre1"> Integrity. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">Followers must demonstrate loyalty and a willingness to act
according to accepted beliefs. Integrity requires one to identify and be true
to values. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.15.7.<b class="calibre1"> Adaptability. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">Ever-changing roles, missions, and systems require
followers to be adaptable to change without being paralyzed by the stress of
not knowing all the answers. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.15.8.<b class="calibre1"> Self-Employment. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">Followers must take responsibility for their own careers,
actions, and development. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.15.9.<b class="calibre1"> Courage. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">Followers must have the confidence and guts to do and say
the right things at the right times. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.15.10.<b class="calibre1"> Credibility. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal86">By
demonstrating competency in their words and deeds, followers earn trust and an
honorable reputation. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.16. Follower Needs. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal87">Successful leaders must devote
attention to what their Airmen want and expect. Otherwise, leaders may lose the
opportunity to capitalize on their talents or lose their Airmen’s respect.
Followers need to know they can count on their leaders when the going gets
tough. Furthermore, respect is a two-way street; followers also want to be
respected. Followers treated as if they are not important, or who perceive that
they are not important, lose their willingness and desire to perform. Leaders
demonstrate belief in their Airmen by: (1) maintaining or enhancing their Airmen’s
self-esteem; (2) listening carefully to their Airmen and responding with
empathy; and (3) asking for their Airmen’s help and encouraging their
involvement. A few moments of sincerity and thoughtfulness go a long way toward
satisfying Airmen’s basic needs. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">Followers perform best when they want to be in a unit, not
when they are trapped in the unit. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.17. Ways to Promote Followership. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal73">Empowered followership, like motivation, requires a
joint effort between leaders and the individuals they lead. This effort must be
continuously promoted. Leaders must listen and respond to the ideas and needs
of their followers, and followers are similarly required to listen and respond
to the ideas and needs of their leaders. Mutual trust is the axis around which
this synergistic relationship revolves; the benefits reaped are plentiful. Team
requirements are best served when the leader helps followers develop their own
initiatives, encourages them to use their own judgment, and allows them to grow
and become more effective communicators. As a result of promoting empowered
followership, follower skills such as troubleshooting, problem solving,
information gathering, conflict resolution, and change management will improve
dramatically. Another way to promote empowered followership is by getting out
among the Airmen and sharing their interests. Airmen respond to leaders who
show sincere interest in them. The success of great leaders depends on their
ability to establish a base of loyal, capable, and knowledgeable followers. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.18. Mentor Defined. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal73">A mentor is a trusted counselor or guide. Mentoring,
therefore, is a relationship in which a person with greater experience and
wisdom guides another person to develop both personally and professionally. The
long-term health of the Air Force depends upon the experienced member
developing the next in line. Air Force mentoring is governed by AFMAN 36-2643, <i class="calibre3">Air
Force Mentoring Program</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.19. Mentoring Scope: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal21">10.19.1. Mentoring helps prepare people for the
increased responsibilities they will assume as they progress in their careers.
Mentoring is not a promotion enhancement program; mentoring is an ongoing
process and not confined to the formal feedback required by AFI 36-2406,<i class="calibre3">
Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems</i>,<i class="calibre3"> </i>and AFI 36-1001, <i class="calibre3">Managing
the Civilian Performance Program.</i> Moreover, mentoring is a professional
development program designed to help each individual reach his or her maximum
potential. Professional development is not a new concept and occurs at every
echelon and activity. AFI 36-2909, <i class="calibre3">Professional and Unprofessional
Relationships,</i> and AFI 36-703, <i class="calibre3">Civilian Conduct and Responsibility</i>,
explains the standards regarding professional relationships. In particular,
mentoring is part of a professional relationship because mentoring fosters
communication between subordinates and supervisors concerning careers,
performance, duties, and missions. Finally, mentoring enhances morale and
discipline and improves the operational environment while maintaining respect
for authority. </p>

<p class="msonormal21">10.19.2. Air Force mentoring covers a wide range of
areas, such as career guidance, technical and professional development,
leadership, Air Force history and heritage, air and space power doctrine,
strategic vision, and contributions to joint warfighting. Therefore, Air Force
mentoring includes knowledge of the military ethics and an understanding of the
Air Force’s core values: Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence
In All We Do.<i class="calibre3"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal23">10.19.3. Commanders and supervisors must encourage
Airmen to read and comprehend air and space power literature, such as Air Force
doctrine and operational warfighting publications and the books in the Chief of
Staff of the Air Force Professional Reading Program.  </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.20. Assignment of Mentors: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal22">10.20.1. The immediate supervisor or rater is the primary
mentor (coach, counselor, guide, role model) for each of his or her Airmen.
This designation in no way restricts the subordinate’s desire to seek
additional counseling and professional development advice from other sources or
mentors. Supervisors and commanders must make themselves available to Airmen
who seek career guidance and counsel. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">10.20.2. Key to the mentoring process is direct
involvement by the commander and supervisor. Commanders and supervisors must
continually challenge their Airmen to improve. They must provide clear
performance feedback and guidance in setting realistic near-, mid-, and
long-term professional and personal development goals. </p>

<p class="msonormal21">10.20.3. Several programs exist to help the
commander and supervisor focus attention on an Airman’s professional
development. Among these are performance feedback, PME, academic education
opportunities, assignment policies, recognition programs, and the individual’s
own personal development actions. Additionally, many organizations, programs,
and associations are dedicated to the advancement and education of military
professionals. The first sergeant, base education center, and Airman and Family
Readiness Center can provide lists and contact information for organizations
that support military development. Leaders should also ensure that Airmen are
aware of specific tools available to them such as MyVector which enables web
based mentoring, career planning, and knowledge sharing. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.21. Mentoring Responsibilities.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal73">Air Force leaders have an inherent responsibility to
mentor future leaders. Supervisors must take an active role in their Airmen’s
professional development. They must assist their people by providing realistic
evaluations of both performance and potential. Supervisors must also be
positive role models. At minimum, mentoring consists of a discussion of
performance, potential, and professional development plans during the
performance feedback session. The feedback should include promotion, PME,
advanced degree work, physical fitness, personal goals and expectations,
professional qualities, next assignment, and long-range plans, at minimum.
Mentors must distinguish between individual goals, career aspirations, and
realistic expectations. Each individual defines a successful career
differently. There are numerous paths to meet individual career and success
goals. Foremost, however, individuals must focus on Air Force institutional
needs. The Air Force must develop people skilled in the employment and support
of air and space power and how this meets national security needs. While there
is nothing wrong with lofty goals, mentors must ensure personnel realize what
high but achievable goals are. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.22. Professional Military Education and Academic
Education. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal74">PME and academic education enhance performance in
each phase of professional development and build on the foundation of
leadership abilities shown during the earlier stages of an individual’s career.
The role of PME in professional development is to prepare individuals to take
on increased responsibilities appropriate to their grade and to enhance their
contribution to the Air Force. Members should focus on enhancing professional
competence and becoming superior leaders, while expanding their operational
employment of air, space, and cyberspace power knowledge. Post-secondary
degrees (associate, bachelor’s, master’s, or other advanced academic degrees)
are important to professional development to the extent that they enhance the
degree holder’s job and professional qualifications. A degree directly related
to an individual’s primary specialty area or occupational series is most
appropriate because this type of degree adds to his or her depth of knowledge.
This is why senior noncommissioned officers are required to complete the Senior
Noncommissioned Officer Academy by correspondence or in residence and obtain a
Community College of the Air Force degree (any specialty) to receive a senior
rater endorsement on their performance reports. (<b class="calibre1">Note:</b> This requirement
is the minimum criteria for endorsement consideration and does not guarantee
automatic endorsement.) A master’s or doctorate degree in management or more
general studies enhances job performance for personnel reaching the highest
grade levels, where duties may require broader managerial skills. In some
career fields, advanced formal education is a prerequisite for certain jobs. <b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.23. Professional Associations. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal21">Many private organizations develop professional
skills and associations for individuals in many career fields and technical
specialties. Membership in such associations may provide additional
opportunities for mentoring as well as broaden technical expertise. Most Air
Force bases have private organizations for each rank tier (for example, Top III
(Master Sergeant-Chief Master Sergeant)). </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.24. Evaluation and Performance Feedback.<i class="calibre3"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal74">Air Force evaluation systems are designed to
accurately appraise performance. Substantive, formal feedback is essential to
the effectiveness of the evaluation systems. Performance evaluation systems are
an integral part of mentoring and professional development. Performance
feedback is designed to provide a realistic assessment of performance, career
standing, future potential, and actions required to help the ratee reach the
next level of professional development. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.25. Promotion Selection. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal22">The Weighted Airman Promotion System outlines the
requirements for promotion selection (Staff Sergeant through Master Sergeant)
and provides feedback score sheets to enlisted members considered for
promotion. These score sheets help the individual to determine professional
development needs. Selection for promotion to Senior Master Sergeant and Chief
Master Sergeant is accomplished using an integrated weighted and central
selection board system. In addition to the weighted score, the central
selection board evaluates each individual using the “whole person concept.”
Board scores are determined by considering performance, leadership, breadth of
experience, job responsibility, professional competence, specific achievements,
and education. The board score is added to the weighted score to determine
order of merit for promotion. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.26. The Military Assignment System.<i class="calibre3"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal74">The mentor and the individual should both focus on
obtaining an assignment that enhances professional development and meets Air
Force needs without necessarily keying on a specific position or location. The
individual is expected to do well in his or her current assignment. When an
individual becomes eligible for reassignment, he or she should address
assignment preferences with their supervisor. Assignments should complement the
individual’s professional development needs and be second only to mission
requirements. Supervisors can use the career field education and training plan
to help develop career path guidance. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.27. Recognition, Awards, and Decorations<i class="calibre3">.</i> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal88">Military members are eligible for consideration for
various decorations throughout their careers. However, supervisors should not
submit recommendations just to “do something for their people.” Supervisors
should restrict recommendations to recognitions of meritorious service,
outstanding achievement, etc., that clearly place the individual above his or
her peers. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Section
10D—Developmental Counseling </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.28. Airman Development. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal21">Airman leadership development is one of the most
important responsibilities of every Air Force leader. Developing future leaders
should be one of the highest priorities of a leader. The future of the Air
Force rests on the shoulders of those prepared for greater responsibility. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.29. Purpose. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal74">Developmental counseling is a shared effort. Leaders
assist Airmen in identifying strengths and weaknesses and creating plans of
action. Leaders then support them throughout the plan implementation and
assessment. However, to achieve success, Airmen must be forthright in their commitment
to improve and candid in their own assessment and goal setting. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.30. Leader Responsibilities. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal74">Leaders coach Airmen the same way athletic coaches
improve their teams: by identifying weaknesses, setting goals, developing and
implementing plans of action, and providing oversight and motivation throughout
the process. Effective coaches or leaders must thoroughly understand the
strengths, weaknesses, and professional goals of their Airmen. Air Force
leaders conduct counseling to help Airmen become better members of the team,
maintain or improve performance, and prepare for the future. To conduct
effective counseling, leaders should develop a counseling style using the
characteristics listed in Figure 10.2. This approach is very similar to the art
of leadership coaching. Coaching is a growing field in the Air Force. The Air
Force Academy can provide more information about coaching as they have a new
Mosaic Coaching Program. An overview of this program is available at <a href="http://www.usafa.edu/Commandant/cwc/cwcs/docs/Mosiac_Coaching/Mosaic_Coaching_Description.pdf" class="calibre20"><span class="calibre21">http://www.usafa.edu</span></a><a href="http://www.usafa.edu/Commandant/cwc/cwcs/docs/Mosiac_Coaching/Mosaic_Coaching_Description.pdf" class="calibre20"><span class="calibre21">.</span></a><span class="calibre21"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal"><b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.31. The Leader as a Counselor. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal22">Air Force leaders must demonstrate certain qualities to be
effective counselors. These qualities include respect for Airmen,
self-awareness, cultural awareness, empathy, and credibility. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.31.1.<b class="calibre1"> Respect for Airmen.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal11">Allowing Airmen to take responsibility for their own
ideas and actions is a show or respect and helps create mutual respect in the
leader-subordinate relationship. Mutual respect improves the chances of
changing or maintaining behavior and achieving goals. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.31.2.<b class="calibre1"> Self-Awareness.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal93">Leaders must be fully aware of
their own values, needs, and biases before counseling Airmen. Self-aware
leaders are less likely to project their biases onto Airmen. Also, aware
leaders are more likely to act consistently with their own values and actions.
10.31.3.<b class="calibre1"> Cultural Awareness.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal28">Leaders need to be aware of the similarities and
differences between individuals of different cultural backgrounds and how these
factors may influence values, perspectives, and actions. Unfamiliarity with
cultural backgrounds may hinder leaders in addressing cultural issues,
especially if they generate concerns within the organization or hinder
team-building. Cultural awareness enhances a leader’s ability to display
empathy. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.31.4.<b class="calibre1"> Empathy. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">Empathy is to be understanding of and sensitive to
another person’s feelings, thoughts, and experiences to the point that you can
almost feel or experience them yourself. Leaders with empathy can put
themselves in their Airman’s shoes and see a situation from the other person’s
perspective. Understanding the Airman’s position can help the Airman develop a
plan of action that fits his or her personality and needs—one that works for
the Airman. Not fully comprehending a situation from the Airman’s point of view
gives a leader less credibility and influence. As a result, the Airman is less
likely to commit to the agreed-upon plan of action. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.31.5.<b class="calibre1"> Credibility</b>. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">Leaders achieve credibility by being honest and
consistent in their statements and actions. Using a straightforward style and
behaving in a manner that Airmen respect and trust makes a leader credible.
Leaders can earn credibility by repeatedly demonstrating a willingness to
assist and being consistent in what they say and do. To influence Airmen
without credibility is difficult. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.32. Leader Counseling Skills. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal21">Leaders should seek to develop and improve their own
counseling abilities. The techniques needed to provide effective counseling
vary from person to person and session to session. However, general skills
needed in almost every situation include active listening, responding, and
questioning. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.32.1.<b class="calibre1"> Active Listening.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal15">During counseling, leaders must actively listen. By
actively listening, leaders communicate verbally and nonverbally that they have
received the message. To learn more about active listening, refer to Chapter
14, <i class="calibre3">Communicating in Today’s Air Force</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.32.2.<b class="calibre1"> Responding. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">A leader responds both verbally and nonverbally to
communicate understanding and to clarify and confirm what has been said. Verbal
responses consist of summarizing, interpreting, and clarifying the message.
Nonverbal responses include eye contact and occasional gestures such as a head
nod. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.32.3.<b class="calibre1"> Questioning.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal55">Although questioning is a necessary skill, use this
skill with caution. Too many questions can aggravate the power differential
between a leader and an Airman and place the Airman in a passive mode. The
Airman may also react to excessive questioning as an intrusion of privacy and
become defensive. During a leadership development review, ask questions to
obtain information or to get the Airman to think about a particular situation.
Generally, questions should be open-ended to evoke more than a “yes-or-no”
answer. Well-posed questions may help to verify understanding, encourage
further explanation, or help the Airman move through the stages of the
counseling session. </p>

<p class="msonormal14"> </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.33. Types of Developmental Counseling.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal22">Developmental counseling can be categorized based on the
topic of the session. Event-oriented counseling and performance and
professional growth counseling are the two major categories of counseling. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.33.1.<b class="calibre1"> Event-Oriented Counseling. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">Event-oriented counseling involves a specific event
or situation and may precede events such as applying for a special duty
assignment or attending a school. This type of counseling may follow events
such as a noteworthy duty performance, a problem with performance or mission
accomplishment, or a personal problem. Event-oriented counseling includes, but
is not limited to: </p>

<p class="msonormal28">10.33.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> Counseling for Specific Instances.</b>
Sometimes counseling is connected to specific instances of superior or
substandard duty performance or behavior. Leaders must tell Airmen whether or
not their performance met the standard and what they did right or wrong (e.g.
performance feedback counseling). The key to successful counseling for specific
performance is to conduct the counseling as close to the event as possible.
Leaders should counsel Airmen for specific examples of superior as well as
substandard duty performance. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">10.33.1.2.<b class="calibre1"> Crisis Counseling.</b> Leaders may
conduct crisis counseling to get an Airman through the initial shock after
receiving negative news, such as notification of the death of a loved one.
Listening and, as appropriate, providing assistance may greatly assist the
Airman dealing with a crisis. </p>

<p class="msonormal28">10.33.1.3.<b class="calibre1"> Referral Counseling.</b> Referral
counseling helps Airmen work through a personal situation and may or may not
follow crisis counseling. Referral counseling may also act as preventive
counseling before the situation becomes a problem. Usually, the leader assists
the Airman in identifying the problem and refers the subordinate to the appropriate
resource, such as legal services, a chaplain, or an alcohol and drug counselor.
</p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.33.2.<b class="calibre1"> Performance and Professional Growth Counseling.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal17">During performance and professional growth
counseling, conduct a review of an Airman’s duty performance during a certain
period and set standards for the next period. Rather than dwelling on the past,
focus the session on the Airman’s strengths, areas needing improvement, and
potential. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.34. Approaches to Counseling. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal87">An effective leader approaches
each Airman as an individual. Different people and different situations require
different counseling approaches. Three approaches to counseling include
nondirective, directive, and combined. These approaches differ in the
techniques used, but they all fit the definition of counseling and contribute
to the overall purpose. The major difference between the approaches is the
degree to which the Airman participates and interacts during a counseling
session. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">Figure 10.3 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of
each approach. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.34.1.<b class="calibre1"> Nondirective.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal11">The nondirective approach is preferred for most
counseling sessions. During the counseling session, listen rather than make
decisions or give advice. Clarify what is said. Cause the Airman to bring out
important points to better understand the situation. When appropriate,
summarize the discussion. Avoid providing solutions or rendering opinions;
instead, maintain a focus on individual and organizational goals and
objectives. Ensure the Airman’s plan of action supports those goals and
objectives. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.34.2.<b class="calibre1"> Directive.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal15">The directive approach works best to correct simple
problems, make on-the-spot corrections, and correct aspects of duty
performance. The leader using the directive style does most of the talking and
tells the Airman what and when of doing something. In contrast to the
nondirective approach, the leader directs a course of action for the Airman.
Choose this approach when time is short, when you alone know what to do, or if
an Airman has limited problemsolving skills. Finally, directive is appropriate
when an Airman is immature, insecure, or needs guidance. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.34.3.<b class="calibre1"> Combined.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal28">In the combined approach, the leader uses techniques
from both the directive and nondirective approaches, adjusting them to
articulate what is best for the Airman. The combined approach emphasizes the
Airman’s planning and decision-making responsibilities. With your assistance,
the Airman develops a plan of action. Listen, suggest possible courses, and
help analyze each possible solution to determine the good and bad points. Then
help the Airman fully understand all aspects of the situation and encourage the
Airman to decide which solution is best. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.35. The Counseling Process. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal22">The four stages of the counseling process are identify the
need for counseling, prepare for counseling, conduct the counseling session,
and follow up. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.35.1.<b class="calibre1"> Identify the Need for Counseling. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Conduct developmental counseling whenever the need
arises for focused, two-way communication aimed at Airman development.
Developing Airmen consists of observing their performance, comparing
performance to the standard, and then providing them feedback in the form of
counseling. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.35.2.<b class="calibre1"> Prepare for Counseling. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">Successful counseling requires preparation. To prepare for
counseling: </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.35.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Select a Suitable Place.</b> When scheduling
counseling, consider an environment with minimal interruptions and free from
distractions. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">10.35.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Schedule the Time.</b> When possible,
counsel an Airman during the duty day. Counseling after duty hours may be
rushed or perceived as unfavorable. The length of time required for counseling
depends on the complexity of the issue. Generally, a counseling session should
last less than 1 hour. If you need more time, schedule a second session. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.35.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Notify the Airman well in Advance.</b> The
Airman should know why, where, and when the counseling session will take place.
Counseling following a specific event should happen as close to the event as
possible. </p>

<p class="msonormal28">10.35.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Organize the Pertinent Information.</b>
Solid preparation is essential to effective counseling. Review all pertinent
information including the purpose of the counseling, facts and observations
about the Airman, identification of possible problems, main points of
discussion, and the development of a plan of action. Focus on specific and
objective behaviors the Airman must maintain or improve upon as well as a plan
of action with clear, obtainable goals. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">10.35.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Plan the Counseling Approach. </b>There
are as many approaches to counseling as there are leaders. The directive,
nondirective, and combined approaches to counseling were addressed earlier. Use
a strategy that suits the Airman and the situation. </p>

<p class="msonormal28">10.35.2.6. <b class="calibre1">Establish the Right Atmosphere.</b>
The right atmosphere promotes two-way communication between a leader and
Airman. To establish a relaxed atmosphere, offer the Airman a seat or something
to drink. Sit in a chair facing the Airman rather than behind a desk because a
desk can be perceived as a barrier. Some situations, however, make an informal
atmosphere inappropriate. For example, a more formal atmosphere is normally
used to give specific guidance and reinforces the leader’s rank, position, and
authority. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.35.3. <b class="calibre1">Conduct the Counseling Session. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Be flexible when conducting a counseling session.
Often, counseling for a specific incident occurs spontaneously as leaders
encounter Airmen in their daily activities. Good leaders take advantage of
naturally occurring events to provide Airmen with feedback. Even when you have
not prepared for formal counseling, you should follow the four basic components
of a counseling session: </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.35.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Open the Counseling Session.</b> The best way
to open a counseling session is to clearly state the purpose. Establish the
preferred setting early in the session by inviting the Airman to speak. </p>

<p class="msonormal28">10.35.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> Discuss the Issues. </b>Attempt to
develop a mutual understanding of the issues with the Airman. This is best
developed by letting the Airman do most of the talking. Use active listening;
respond and question without dominating the conversation. Aim to help the
Airman better understand the subject of the counseling, such as duty
performance, a problem situation and the impact, or potential areas for growth.
Both you and the Airman should provide examples or cite specific observations
to reduce the perception that is unnecessarily biased or judgmental. However,
when the issue is substandard performance, make it clear how the performance
did not meet the standard and then develop a plan of action. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">10.35.3.3.<b class="calibre1"> Develop a Plan of Action. </b>A plan
of action identifies a method for achieving a desired result and specifies what
the Airman must do to reach the goals set during the counseling session. The
plan of action must be specific. The plan of action should show the Airman how
to modify or maintain his or her behavior. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">10.35.3.4.<b class="calibre1"> Record and Close the Session. </b>Documentation
serves as a reference to the agreed-upon plan of action and the Airman’s
accomplishments, improvements, personal preferences, or problems. To close the
session, summarize key points and ask if the Airman understands the plan of
action. Invite the Airman to review the plan of action and what you, as the
leader, expect from him or her. With the Airman, establish any follow-up
measures necessary to support the successful implementation of the plan of
action. These may include providing the Airman with resources and time,
periodically assessing the plan, and following through on referrals. Schedule
any future meetings, at least tentatively, before dismissing the Airman. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.35.4. <b class="calibre1">Follow up. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">The counseling process does not end with the
counseling session. Follow up continues through implementation of the plan of
action and evaluation of results. After counseling, support the Airman as he or
she implements the plan of action. Support may include teaching, coaching, or
providing time and resources. Observe and assess this process and possibly
modify the plan to meet goals. Appropriate measures after counseling include
follow-up counseling, making referrals, informing the chain of command, and
taking corrective measures. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.36. Leveraging Diversity. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal73">Our work environment today is more diverse than
ever. The Air Force team is comprised of military, civilians, and contractors.
Leaders can find themselves dealing with a workforce ranging from 18-year-olds
to those with 18 or more years of experience. The challenge is to incorporate
everyone’s specific talents into a cohesive and optimal workforce. We must
recognize that people are vital to an organization’s success. Consequently, we
need to understand the motivations and interests of this diverse workforce. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">10.36.1. People are motivated for their reasons, not
yours. What sparks interest and passion in one person does not necessarily
ignite the next person. Effective leaders take time to recognize what excites
others, leverages their talent to the organization, and cultivate a work
culture that recognizes and appreciates differing perspectives and approaches
to solving problems. Consider this: the Air Force attracts people from every
aspect of society, culture, and social status. When, where, and how someone was
raised impacts their value system. None of these variables are under a
supervisor’s direct control. Supervisors cannot change someone’s inherent
characteristics, but they can change how to lead these people as a cohesive
team. Foremost, leaders must create a hospitable climate that promotes respect
and inclusion. This will reduce dysfunctional tension and increase team
productivity. Specifically, how can this be achieved? </p>

<p class="msonormal7">10.36.2. The first step in leading a diverse
organization is to form common ground or a shared set of assumptions, which
will form the framework within to communicate. The common ground is the
organization itself, the vision, goals, rules, regulations, processes, and
procedures that govern what the unit does to achieve mission requirements.
Clear guidelines improve communication, reduce confusion, provide purpose, and
define desired outcomes. A team must have a clear sense of direction or else
there will be mass confusion with everyone going in different directions. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">10.36.3. Having established common ground, we must
increase awareness and expel stereotypes. Examples include younger employees
are “wet behind the ears,” know nothing, have no respect or loyalty, lack
experience, have no credibility, and cannot be trusted with much responsibility.
At the other end of the social spectrum, older employees are considered less
motivated to work hard, are nothing but deadwood, resistant to change, cannot
learn new methods/technology, plateau at 40, should be fired after 50, and are
‘fire proof.’ Stereotypes ignore differences among the individuals in a group.
The workplace has no room for such stereotypes. Instead, leaders must
acknowledge the richness and benefits of diversity. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">10.36.4. People are different. There is no way to
make them fit into a single mold, nor is there any reason to. We do not live in
a world of carbon-copied people. To effectively manage a diverse workforce, we
must acknowledge differences. However, we should focus more on what we have in
common. </p>

<p class="msonormal21">10.36.5. Use everyone’s experiences and background
as a resource. Diversity of experience and background ensures diverse ways of
looking at problems. Managing our workforce diversity can result in higher
productivity, improved performance, more creativity, more innovations, and reduced
stress. Giving emphasis to diversity without threatening our unity is the
proper way to strengthen the ties that bind the team together. Sensitivity,
mutual respect, and common trust coupled with communication are the prime
ingredients to integrating our Airmen. </p>

<p class="msonormal124">10.36.6. Former Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force,
General John P. Jumper stated, “Air Force diversity is a critical warfighting
and readiness issue. Maximizing the benefits of diversity is a mission
imperative. We expect Air Force leaders to challenge any policy, practice, or
process that limits the growth and development of potential leaders from all
groups.” Industry studies have consistently revealed that heterogeneous or
diverse groups are more innovative than homogeneous groups because they view
improvement opportunities from multiple perspectives. Managing diversity is
determining which differences matter in enriching a product or service.
Productivity is an outcome of respect and inclusion. Former Chief of Staff,
U.S. Air Force, General Ronald Fogleman said, “People are the assets that
determine our success or failure. If you are to be a good leader, you have to
cultivate your skills in the arena of personal relations.” The skilled leader
deals effectively with all races, nationalities, cultures, disabilities, ages,
and gender. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Section 10E—Full
Range Leadership Development (FRLD)</i></b> </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.37. Full Range Leadership Development. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal21">A full range of leadership behaviors is essential in
today’s complex world. Therefore, developing full range leadership potential
throughout the workforce has become a principal initiative in several of
today’s most successful organizations, to include the U.S. Air Force. Though
the leadership theories of the past were very successful, today’s Air Force
depends on highly effective Airmen with the flexibility and capability to
operate throughout a spectrum of leadership styles. FRLD was adopted because
the best parts of past leadership theories are combined. </p>

<p class="msonormal74">10.37.1. FRLD is unique and requires us to view
leadership as a system made up of three core elements: the leader, the
follower, and the situation. The components of the FRLD system are
interdependent of one another. Its success relies not only on the leader’s
actions, but also the follower and the situation. FRLD requires today’s leaders
to consider the follower and each situation and be willing to: </p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.37.1.1. Develop relationships with leadership, peers,
and subordinates.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.37.1.2. Take advantage of opportunities as they come
available.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.37.1.3. Efficiently use available resources.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.37.1.4. Properly evaluate situations and the performance
of followers.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.37.1.5. Reward appropriately (and discipline
accordingly).<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">10.37.1.6. Identify improvement areas in one’s self, their
followers, and the work place.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal125">10.37.2. The FRLD Model (Figure 10.4) includes five
leadership behaviors ranging from the passive, less effective Laissez-Faire
behavior to the more active and effective Transformational Leadership behavior.
</p>

<p class="msonormal126">10.37.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Laissez-Faire. </b>Laissez-faire
leaders view the development and needs of their subordinates as someone else’s
concern. They tend to pass on and abandon their responsibilities and remain
indifferent toward important issues. They are hesitant to make decisions and
are usually absent from their place of work, which negatively affects
relationships with peers and subordinates.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal127">10.37.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Management by
Exception-Passive. </b>This leadership behavior is the <i class="calibre3">“if it isn’t broke,
don’t fix it”</i> leadership style. Here, leaders elect to sit back, observe,
and wait for things to go wrong before taking action. They intervene only when
policies or rules are broken. Management by Exception-Passive is a little more
effective than Laissez-Faire because subordinates know that leadership will
hold them accountable if they fail to meet standards of performance or comply
with policies and procedures. </p>

<p class="msonormal128"><img border="0" id="Picture 979121" src="image002.png" class="calibre59"/></p>

<p class="msonormal129"><span class="calibre60"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal130">10.37.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Management by Exception-Active. </b>This
leadership behavior ensures leaders keep personnel and processes in control.
They monitor and govern subordinates through forced compliance with rules,
regulations, and expectations for meeting performance standards. Management by
Exception-Active exists in a structured system with detailed instructions,
careful observation, and very <i class="calibre3">active</i> supervision. Furthermore, this
leadership behavior reduces organizational uncertainties, avoids unnecessary
risks, and ensures important goals are being achieved. This transactional
leadership behavior reduces the temptation for employees to avoid their duties
or act unethically and aids members in meeting defined performance objectives. </p>

<p class="msonormal28">10.37.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Transactional Leadership and
Contingent Rewards. </b>Transactional leadership and contingent rewards involve
the constructive <i class="calibre3">transaction</i> between a leader and his or her followers.
These transactions are “contracts” where the leader sets goals, identifies ways
for the subordinate to reach these goals, and supports the follower along the
way. The follower is then required to perform their assigned tasks to a
specified performance level and, when they achieve their leader’s expectations,
the leader reinforces the positive behavior by providing a reward. In other
words, the reward is contingent upon the follower performing assigned tasks to
expectations. </p>

<p class="msonormal131">10.37.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Transformational Leadership.</b> The
transformational leader offers followers a vision and inspires their mission.
This type of leadership inspires followers to exceed their goals and promotes
positive, meaningful changes. There are four components of transformational
leadership, called the <i class="calibre3">4 I’s</i>: Individualized Consideration, Intellectual
Stimulation, Idealized Influence, and Inspirational Motivation. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">10.37.2.5.1. <b class="calibre1">Individualized Consideration (<i class="calibre3">Nurturing</i>).
</b>Individualized consideration is where leaders treat their followers as
individuals with different needs, abilities, and aspirations and not just as a
part of a group of subordinates. They empathize with and support each follower while
maintaining healthy communication. Using Individualized Consideration, leaders
‘nurture’ followers by acting as mentor or coach. </p>

<p class="msonormal132">10.37.2.5.2. <b class="calibre1">Intellectual Stimulation (<i class="calibre3">Thinking</i>).
</b>Intellectual Stimulation is the degree to which a leader values their subordinates’
rationality and intellect, seeking different perspectives and considering
opposing points of view. Using Intellectual Stimulation, leaders stimulate and
encourage creativity in their followers, encourage followers to be independent
thinkers, and are not afraid to take risks and solicit ideas from their
followers. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">10.37.2.5.3. <b class="calibre1">Inspirational Motivation (<i class="calibre3">Charming</i>).
</b>This leader behavior involves developing and articulating visions that
paint an optimistic and enthusiastic picture of the future that is appealing
and inspiring to followers. These visions elevate performance expectations and
inspire followers to put forth extra effort to achieve the leader’s vision. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">10.37.2.5.4. <b class="calibre1">Idealized Influence (<i class="calibre3">Influencing</i>).
</b>Transformational leaders are charismatic and act as positive role models
that “walk the walk.” They exhibit high levels of moral behavior, virtues, and
character strengths, as well as a strong work ethic. They represent the
organization’s values, beliefs, and purpose in both words and actions. They set
aside personal interests for the sake of the group. </p>

<p class="msonormal133">10.37.3. Developing these five leadership behaviors
begins by understanding each of them and knowing when, or when not, to apply
them. In addition, possessing the flexibility and capability to implement each
style is critical to successfully leading others, depending on the follower and
the situation. Though a more passive approach may be appropriate at times,
transformational leaders actively and effectively develop the followers today
to become the leaders of tomorrow. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Section
10F—Mentorship</i></b> </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.38.</b> <b class="calibre1">Essential Principles. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal21">Mentoring is a leadership obligation and
responsibility. Through mentoring, senior leaders pass on their experience and
wisdom to junior members as well as philosophy, traditions, shared values,
quality, and lessons learned. Mentoring provides the framework for the
professional development of competent, future Air Force leaders. Mentoring is
an ongoing process and perhaps the most powerful method leadership can use to
shape the future. A mentor is a trusted advisor, teacher, counselor, friend,
parent, and/or the more senior person in the relationship. In organizations,
mentorship can apply to all leaders and supervisors who are responsible for
getting their work done through other people. The assisted individual is
usually referred to as the protégé: a student or pupil who learns from the
mentor. Understanding mentoring principles is essential to practical
implementation. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.39. The Mentoring Process. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal134">The mnemonic at Figure 10.5 demonstrates the
concepts of effective mentoring. (Mnemonics are memory aids that help us
remember the various aspects of a concept. The elements of effective mentoring,
expressed as verbs, correspond to the letters in the word itself.) The following
paragraphs describe each element and clarifies the meaning of a mentor. </p>

<p class="msonormal143">An effective mentor must first lead by example. When
serving as a role model, make no mistake that actions speak much louder than
words. Mentoring requires the mentor and protégé to spend a significant amount
of time together. Here, the protégé is constantly observing and learning from
the mentor’s words and actions. The opportunity to see how the mentor deals
with a variety of situations is an important part of the process. Therefore,
the mentor must show the protégé how a mature professional handles various
challenges and opportunities. In turn, protégés must be willing to learn, seek
assistance, and apply what they have learned. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.39.2.<b class="calibre1"> Empathize. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal131">Mentoring involves much more than merely teaching.
Mentors must empathize, showing genuine compassion for their protégés. Mentors
who remember what it was like when they were new and inexperienced are more
effective in assisting others in their professional development. Empathy
cultivates strong bonds between mentors and protégés and fosters the mutual
commitment that exemplifies mentoring. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.39.3.<b class="calibre1"> Nurture. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal60">Nurturing also emphasizes a caring attitude. Like a
farmer and his or her crops, the mentor nurtures the protégé. One cannot expect
to sow a rich crop without investing ample time, patience, and labor. Certainly
these points seem rather obvious, but are often the most neglected elements.
Some mentors often find themselves too busy to provide the time and effort to
effectively mentor their protégés. Therefore, we must not expect an
expert-level performance from someone who has not received appropriate amounts
of attention, training, and time from a mentor. Remember, for people to apply,
internalize, and value what they have learned takes time. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">10.39.4.<b class="calibre1"> Teach. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal60">Many people, regardless of their knowledge and
experience level, find teaching uncomfortable and extremely stressful.
Thankfully, some time-tested methods provide a solid benchmark for instruction.
Consider these five simple steps when teaching and training protégés: (1)
organize the material into logical; systematic, units of manageable size; (2)
correct errors immediately; (3) frequently review previously covered material
and relate the material to the current lesson; (4) include practical exercises
to help the protégé exercise the newfound knowledge; and (5) evaluate the
protégés’ comprehension often, formally and informally, and provide detailed
feedback on their progress. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.39.5.<b class="calibre1"> Organize. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Mentors must first be organized before helping
others become organized. Hence, a systematic, methodical approach is essential.
An organized mentor knows from the very beginning what he or she wants to
achieve, focusing every aspect of the process on this goal. The time and effort
spent organizing thoughts and materials into a logical, building-block
sequential plan of lessons aimed at a precisely defined target pays big
dividends in the form of improved learning and developmental experiences for
the protégé. </p>

<p class="msonormal144">10.39.6.<b class="calibre1"> Respond. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">Mentoring is a two-way communication process that
requires mentors to actively listen to the protégés’ questions and provide
useful and timely responses. There may be times when the protégé is reluctant
to ask a particular question. Therefore, effective mentors must remain alert to
recognize nonverbal behaviors and subtle communication cues. Rather than
sitting back and waiting for the protégé to ask questions, be proactive.
Anticipate the needs, problems, and concerns of protégés and take care of them
immediately.  </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.39.7.<b class="calibre1"> Inspire. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal60">A mentor should be more than just a good role model,
teacher, or helpful acquaintance. Genuine mentoring encompasses an element of
inspiration. Inspirational mentors have a profound impact on their protégés
that encourages them to transform into a more improved being. Inspiration is
one of the characteristics that distinguishes leaders from managers. The best mentors
most likely become the best leaders because they are able to inspire others. </p>

<p class="msonormal145">10.39.8.<b class="calibre1"> Network. </b>A good
mentor introduces and “connects” a protégé to other people who can also provide
guidance, support, resources, and opportunities. Networking is a vital function
that provides protégés a head start on establishing themselves in their
professional community. Building a solid network of friends, acquaintances, and
associates takes time; the earlier a protégé can cultivate this, the better. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">10.39.9.<b class="calibre1"> Goal-Set. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal146">Many young, inexperienced people do not understand
the importance of setting goals. Oftentimes, they lack the expertise to
establish specific, achievable, and realistic goals. Therefore, mentors must
help their protégés understand why goals are important; establish short- and
long-term goals that are specific, achievable, and realistic; and be available
to assist them in achieving their goals.<b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal147"><b class="calibre1">10.40. Definition of Strategic Leadership. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal148">Strategic leadership plays a critical role in
propelling today’s Air Force through and beyond the 21st century. Strategic
leadership is such a broad concept, that we may not be able to define, but we
can certainly recognize strategic leadership in action. Noel Tichy, Director of
the Global Leadership Program at the Ross School of Business, offers a
comprehensible depiction as to what a strategic leader is: </p>

<p class="msonormal149"><i class="calibre3">“Strategic
leaders guide the achievement of their organizational vision within a larger
enterprise by directing policy and strategy, building consensus, acquiring and
allocating resources, influencing organizational culture, and shaping complex
and ambiguous external environments. They lead by example to build effective
organizations, grow the next generation of leaders, energize subordinates, seek
opportunities to advance organizational goals, and balance personal and
professional demands.”</i><i class="calibre3"><span class="calibre64"> </span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal"><b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.41. Components of Strategic Leadership: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7">10.41.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Enlisted leaders apply the strategic
leadership components of core values, competencies, and actions at the
tactical, operational, and strategic levels every day. Leadership at the
tactical level is predominantly direct and face-to-face. As leaders ascend the
organizational ladder to the operational level, leadership responsibilities
become more complex and sophisticated. Strategic leaders have a responsibility
to large organizations and systems and are expected to conceptualize and
integrate a variety of issues to accomplish the mission. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">10.41.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Core values form the foundation of
leadership (paragraph 10.12), coupled with competencies (personal, people/team,
and institutional leadership) and actions. Personal leadership focuses on
interpersonal relations that directly influence human behavior and values.
People/team leadership involves more interpersonal relations and team
relationships. Leaders using this competency tailor resources to organizations
and programs. Institutional leadership is about establishing structure,
allocating resources appropriately, and articulating the organizational vision.
</p>

<p class="msonormal7">10.41.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Actions include training and
educational activities designed to develop strategic leadership abilities.
Early career development focuses on personal competencies at the tactical
level. At the operational stage, personal leadership continues, but the Air
Force begins to emphasize people/team leadership development and introduces
institutional leadership competencies. At the strategic level, the greatest
emphasis is on developing institutional leadership competencies, primarily
through education designed to help leaders form accurate frames of reference,
make sound decisions, uncover underlying connections between general issues,
and think creatively, innovatively, and critically about new solutions and
options. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">10.42. Strategic Leadership: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal150">10.42.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>At the strategic level, Airmen must
combine highly developed occupational capabilities with competencies gained
earlier in their careers to lead and direct exceptionally complex and
multi-tiered organizations. Strategic leaders must understand Air Force missions
and how operational capabilities and Airmen are integrated to achieve
synergistic results and desired effects. Strategic leaders are also expected to
demonstrate a highly developed and insightful understanding of personal and
team leadership. </p>

<p class="msonormal74">10.42.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>The successful strategic leader is
the quintessential communicator, using all means of communication. Whereas
leaders at lower levels of the organization remain focused on the short term,
strategic leaders must have a future focus, spending much of their time looking
forward, positioning the organization for long-term success. </p>

<p class="msonormal150">10.42.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Strategic leaders seek education and
other opportunities to enhance their understanding and appreciation of
strategic leadership, its responsibilities, functions, and impact on the
organization. They fully understand their role in shaping climate and culture
through vision, policy, communication, education, coaching, mentoring, and
personal example. </p>

<p class="msonormal151"><b class="calibre1">10.43. Conclusion. </b>To <i class="calibre3">lead</i>
means <i class="calibre3">to act as a guide</i> or to guide; a <i class="calibre3">leader</i> is defined as “a
person who leads, directs, commands, or guides a group or activity.” These are
simple definitions, but the implications of poor or ineffective leadership are
devastating to mission success. Given the authority, anyone can command. Leading,
however, is a delicate art calling for people-oriented attributes that many
find difficult to develop and impossible to acquire. With determination and
practical experience, you can develop your leadership skill sets. Commanders
depend on noncommissioned officers to lead Airmen and accomplish the mission.
This chapter discussed the art of leadership, effective leadership,
interrelationship of leadership and management, leadership qualities, and the
concept of vision, and provided an overview on empowerment and learning. Also
provided was information on leadership flexibility and followership, dealing
effectively with change, the critical relationship between leadership and core
values, mentoring, and counseling. These concepts are fundamental to the mission
of the Air Force, as well as the careers and futures of the enlisted force.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

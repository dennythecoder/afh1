<p class="msonormal"><b class="calibre1">Chapter 18 </b></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre1">FIT FORCE </b></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 18A—Overview </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.1. Introduction. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">This chapter covers the fitness program, proper
nutrition, substance abuse, tobacco use, suicide prevention, posttraumatic
stress disorder, reintegration from deployment, medical care, and the Wingman
concept. Air Force members must be physically fit to support the Air Force
mission. Commanders and supervisors must incorporate fitness into the Air Force
culture to establish an environment for members to maintain physical fitness
and health to meet expeditionary mission requirements and deliver a fit-and-ready
force. The annual fitness assessment provides commanders with a tool to assist
in the determination of overall fitness of their military personnel. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 18B—Physical Fitness and
Fitness Components </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.2. Physical
Fitness, Optimal Performance and Mission Readiness. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">Adequate physical fitness levels ensure every
Airman can properly support the Air Force mission while performing at optimal
capacity. The goal of the fitness program is to motivate all members to
participate in a year-round physical conditioning program emphasizing total
fitness to include proper aerobic conditioning, muscular fitness training, and
healthy eating. An active lifestyle will increase productivity, optimize
health, and decrease absenteeism while maintaining a higher level of readiness.
</p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.3. Physical
Fitness.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal6">The five major components of fitness are cardiorespiratory
endurance, body composition, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and
flexibility. Warm-up and cool down are also essential components of a complete
physical fitness program. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">18.3.1. Cardiorespiratory endurance is the ability to
perform large muscle, dynamic, moderate-to-high intensity exercise for
prolonged periods. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">18.3.2. Body composition is the relative portion of the
body comprised of fat and fat-free tissue. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">18.3.3. Muscular strength is the maximum force generated
by a specific muscle or muscle group. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">18.3.4. Muscular endurance is the ability of a muscle
group to execute repeated contractions over a period of sufficient time
duration to cause muscular fatigue. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">18.3.5. Flexibility is the maximum ability to move a joint
freely, without pain, through a range of motion. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.4. Aerobic Fitness.
</b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">A successful cardiorespiratory endurance exercise program
should address modality (type of exercise), volume (frequency multiplied by
duration) and intensity. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">18.4.1. <b class="calibre1">Mode. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7">Select activities that involve a large proportion
of total muscle mass, maximize use of large muscles, (<i class="calibre2">e.g</i>.<i class="calibre2">, </i>muscles around the
thigh and hip), involve dynamic, rhythmic muscle contractions, and minimize
static (no movement) contraction and use of small muscles. Examples are
running, cycling, swimming, rowing, jogging, vigorous walking, indoor aerobic
exercise machines, and some sports <i class="calibre2">if</i>
they are continuous in nature. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.4.2. <b class="calibre1">Volume
(frequency multiplied by duration). </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">Accomplish moderately intense aerobic activity 30
minutes a day, five days a week <i class="calibre2">or </i>vigorously
intense aerobic activity 20 minutes to 25 minutes a day, 3 days a week <i class="calibre2">and </i>muscle fitness exercise (see below),
or an equivalent combination of moderately and vigorously intense aerobic
activity. For additional and more extensive health and fitness benefits,
accomplish moderately intense aerobic activity 300 minutes (5 hours) a week, or
accomplish vigorously intense aerobic activity 150 minutes a week, or an
equivalent combination. Generally, the minimal levels of exercise volume and
intensity above are necessary to maintain health and fitness, while the higher
levels are necessary to improve health and fitness. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.4.3. <b class="calibre1">Intensity. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">Intensity refers to how hard one exercises.
Moderately intense aerobic activity equates to continuous exercise that raises
heart and respiratory rates, initiates sweating (varies with climate), and
permits conversation; vigorously intense aerobic activity elicits higher
physiological responses and permits light or broken conversation. Intensity,
considered the most important variable in training, may be prescribed as a
percentage of maximum velocity, or percentages of physiological variables,
i.e., a percent of maximal volume of oxygen consumed (%VO<sub class="calibre3">2 </sub>max) or
percent of maximal heart rate (%heart rate max). One formula for determining
exercise intensity by heart rate is presented in Figure 18.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11"><b class="calibre1">Figure 18.1. Heart
Rate Formula. </b></p>

<div class="calibre4">

<p class="msonormal12"><span class="calibre5">220 - age =
maximum heart rate for Airmen under 40 years of age. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal12"><span class="calibre5">Max heart
rate = 208 – 0.7(age) for Airmen age 40 years and above. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal12"><span class="calibre5">Measure
resting heart rate for three to four days shortly after waking for a 60 second
period, while in the same body position each day. Take an average of the
measures. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal13"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">-<span class="calibre7">  </span></span></span><span class="calibre5">Calculate
heart rate range. Heart Rate Range = Maximal heart rate – Resting heart rate. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal13"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">-<span class="calibre7">  </span></span></span><span class="calibre5">Calculate
minimum, optimal (target), and do-not-exceed (safety) exercise heart rates: </span></p>

<p class="msonormal13"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">-<span class="calibre7">  </span></span></span><span class="calibre5">Minimum
exercise heart rate = (50% Heart Rate Range) + Resting heart rate. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal13"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">-<span class="calibre7">  </span></span></span><span class="calibre5">Optimal
exercise heart rate = (75% Heart Rate Range) + Resting heart rate. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal13"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">-<span class="calibre7">  </span></span></span><span class="calibre5">Do-not-exceed
exercise heart rate = (85% Heart Rate Range) + Resting heart rate. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal12"><span class="calibre5">For example,
a 30 year old Air Force member with a Resting heart rate of 70 beats a minute
calculates Maximal heart rate as 220 – 30 = 190 beats a minute and heart rate
Range as 190 – 70 = 120. Applying the equations: </span></p>

<p class="msonormal13"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">-<span class="calibre7">  </span></span></span><span class="calibre5">Minimum
exercise heart rate = 50% (120) + 70 = 60 + 70 = 130 beats a minute. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal13"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">-<span class="calibre7">  </span></span></span><span class="calibre5">Optimal
exercise heart rate = 75% (120) + 70 = 90 + 70 = 160 beats a minute. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal13"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">-<span class="calibre7">  </span></span></span><span class="calibre5">Do-not-exceed
exercise heart rate = 85% (120) + 70 = 102 + 70 = 172 beats/min. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal14"><span class="calibre5">Therefore,
this individual should keep exercise heart rate above 130 beats a minute, but
below 172 beats a minute, targeting 160 beats a minute for at least 20 minutes
to 25 minutes 3 days a week. Unfit individuals should start at the lower end of
the heart rate Range. As fitness level increases, the resting heart rate will
decrease, therefore increase the intensity percentage from low (50%) towards
optimal (75%). Also, base fitness personnel can help fine tune these
calculations taking into account medications, risk of injury, and individual
preferences and objectives. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.5. Muscular
Strength and Endurance Training. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">A successful strength and endurance training program
should include the principles of specificity, regularity, recovery, balance,
and variety.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.5.1. <b class="calibre1">Principle of</b>
<b class="calibre1">Specificity. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7">A strength training program should provide
resistance to specific muscle groups that need to be strengthened. These groups
can be identified by doing a simple assessment of functional movement. The
Airman slowly does workrelated or functional movements he or she wants to
improve upon. An example would be the Airman whose job requires them to bend
over, pick up an object, and place it in an overhead position. This
work-related task has the functional movement of a squat and an overhead press
with a weight. By incorporating these moves into a strength training program,
the Airman can improve strength and, therefore, improve work-related tasks
while reducing injuries by being conditioned in those muscles needed to perform
the work. If the Airman’s performance of a task is not adequate, or if he/she
wishes to improve, strength training for the identified muscles will be
beneficial. In this way, he/she ensures maximum carryover value to his/her
warrior tasks. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.5.2. <b class="calibre1">Principle of</b>
<b class="calibre1">Regularity. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">Exercise must be done regularly to produce a
training effect. Sporadic exercise may do more harm than good. Airmen can
maintain a moderate level of strength by doing proper strength workouts only
once a week for a short period of time if they have already established a
strong baseline level of muscular fitness. However, three workouts per week are
best for optimal gains. The principle of regularity also applies to the
exercises for individual muscle groups. An Airman can work out three times a
week, but when different muscle groups are exercised at each workout, the
principle of regularity is violated and gains in strength are minimal. Airmen
should strive for exercising the same muscle group a minimum of twice each
week. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.5.3. <b class="calibre1">Principle of</b>
<b class="calibre1">Recovery. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7">Consecutive days of hard resistance training for
the same muscle group can be detrimental. The muscles must be allowed
sufficient recovery time to adapt. Strength training may be done every day only
if the exercised muscle groups are rotated, so the same muscle or muscle group
is not trained (exercised) on consecutive days. There should be at least a
48-hour recovery period between workouts for the same muscle groups. For
example, the legs can be trained with weights on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
and the upper body muscles on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Recovery is also
important within a workout. The recovery time between different exercises and
sets depends, in part, on the intensity of the workout. Normally, the recovery
time between sets should be 30-180 seconds.<span class="calibre6"> 
</span></p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.5.4. <b class="calibre1">Principle of</b>
<b class="calibre1">Balance. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">When developing a strength training program,
remember the importance of including exercises to work all the major muscle
groups – in both the upper and lower body. You should not work just the muscle
groups in the upper body, with the idea running will strengthen the legs. Most
muscles are organized into opposing pairs; activating one muscle results in a
pulling motion, while activating the opposing muscle results in the opposite or
pushing movement. When planning a training session, one training technique is
to follow a pushing exercise with a pulling exercise resulting in movement at
the same joints. For example, follow an overhead press with a lateral pull-down
exercise. This technique helps ensure good strength balance between opposing
muscle groups which may, in turn, reduce the risk of injury. Sequence the
program to exercise the larger muscle groups first, then the smaller
muscles.<span class="calibre6">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.5.5. <b class="calibre1">Principle of</b>
<b class="calibre1">Variety. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Using different equipment, changing the exercises,
and altering the volume/intensity are good ways to add variety – and they may
also produce better results. The Airmen should periodically substitute
different exercises for given muscle groups. For example, Airmen can do squats
with a barbell instead of leg presses on a weight machine. Also, for variety or
due to necessity (for example, when in the field), they can switch to
partner-resisted exercises or another form of resistance training. However,
avoid frequent fundamental changes as Airmen may become frustrated if they do
not have enough time to adapt or to see improvements in strength.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.6. Flexibility
Training: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">18.6.1. Flexibility is an important component of
any fitness program. Many activity-related injuries have their root in lack of
flexibility. Think of muscles as rubber bands. When they are cold, they are
rigid and brittle. When warm, they stretch and retract more easily. Conducting
a good warm-up before exercising and a good cool down upon completion will help
prevent injury and reduce muscle soreness. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">18.6.2. Regardless of your current fitness level, you
should always begin your exercise sessions with a warm-up and end it with a
cool down. Recommendations are listed in paragraphs 18.8.1 and 18.8.2. below.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.7. Body
Composition. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">The two largest contributing factors to maintaining a
positive body composition are exercise and diet. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">18.7.1. A combination of exercise and diet is the
best way to lose excessive body fat. Losing 1-2 pounds a week is a realistic
goal best accomplished by reducing caloric intake and increasing energy
expenditure. In other words, eat less and exercise more. Dieting alone can cause
the body to believe the body is being starved. In response, the body tries to
conserve its fat reserves by slowing down its metabolic rate and, as a result,
loses at a slower rate. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">18.7.2. Airmen must consume a minimum number of
calories from all the major food groups, with the calories distributed over all
the daily meals – including snacks and drinks. This ensures an adequate
consumption of necessary vitamins and minerals. A male, not under medical
supervision, requires a caloric intake of at least 1,500; women require at
least 1,200 calories and Airmen should avoid diets failing to meet these
criteria. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">18.7.3. There is no “quick and easy” way to improve body
composition. Losing fat safely takes time and patience. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">18.7.4. Exercise not only burn calories, but helps
the body maintain its useful muscle mass and may help keep the body’s metabolic
rate high during dieting. Fat is best utilized during aerobic exercise. Aerobic
exercise, which uses lots of oxygen, is the best type of activity for burning
fat. Aerobic exercise includes jogging, walking, swimming, bicycling,
cross-country skiing, rowing, stair climbing, and jumping rope. Anaerobic
activities, such as sprinting or lifting heavy weights, burn little, if any, fat.
</p>

<p class="msonormal20"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal21"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.8. Warm-up and Cool
Down: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.8.1. <b class="calibre1">The Warm-up. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Before beginning any vigorous physical activity,
you should prepare your body for exercise. The dynamic warmup increases the
flow of blood to the muscles and tendons, thus helping reduce the risk of
injury and increasing the joint’s range of motion and positively affects the
speed of muscular contraction. The following is the recommended sequence of
dynamic warm-up activities for 5-7 minutes before vigorous exercise: </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.8.1.1. Slowly jog in place or walk for 1-2 minutes.
This causes a gradual increase in the heart rate, blood pressure, circulation,
and increases the temperature of the active muscles. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.8.1.2. Slowly rotate joints (for example, arm circles,
knee and ankle rotations) to gradually increase their range of motion; work
each major joint for 5-10 seconds. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">18.8.1.3. Slowly mimic the activities to be performed. For
example, lift a lighter weight to warm up before lifting the heavier one; this
helps prepare the neuromuscular pathways. The dynamic warm-up increases the
flow of blood to the muscles and tendons, helping reduce the risk of injury,
increasing the joint’s range of motion, and positively affects the speed of
muscular contraction. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.8.2. <b class="calibre1">Cool Down. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">18.8.2.1. Do not stop suddenly after vigorous
exercise, but gradually bring your body back to a resting state by slowly
decreasing the intensity of the activity. After running, for example, you
should walk for 1-2 minutes. Stopping exercise suddenly can cause blood to pool
in the muscles, thereby reducing blood flow to the heart and brain. This may
cause fainting or abnormal heart rhythm and this could lead to serious
complications. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">18.8.2.2. Repeat the stretches done in your warm-up
to help ease muscle tension and any immediate feeling of muscle soreness; be
careful not to ‘over-stretch’. The muscles are warm from activity and could be
over-stretched to the point of injury. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.8.2.3. Hold stretches 15-30 seconds or more during your
cool down to improve flexibility. </p>

<p class="msonormal25">18.8.2.4. Do not limit flexibility training to the
cool down periods. Stretching is one form of exercise that takes very little
time relative to the benefits gained and may be done easily at home or work.
Repetitive movements at work or having a more sedentary job can increase
tension in specific muscle groups, which would benefit from mild stretching
during the course of the day. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.9. Unit Physical
Fitness Training Program: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal26">18.9.1. Commander-driven physical fitness training is the
backbone of the Air Force physical fitness program. The program promotes
aerobic and muscular fitness, flexibility, and optimal body composition of each
Airman in the unit. Safety must be an overarching concern throughout physical
training and assessment. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">18.9.2. The program will meet the current ability
level of the members while encouraging and challenging members to progress to a
higher fitness level. The 1.5-mile timed run, 2-kilometer walk, abdominal
circumference, push-up, and situp assessments are designed to measure the
effectiveness of the physical training program. However, training should not be
limited to the assessment activities. </p>

<p class="msonormal27">18.9.3. The unit fitness program will incorporate the
guidelines established in AFI 36-2905, <i class="calibre2">Fitness
Program</i>, to develop general fitness, prevent boredom, and decrease
repetitive strain injuries. Finally, the program must ensure a safe environment
for training by assessing traffic patterns, use of headphones or other personal
equipment, temperature, availability of water and first aid, and awareness of
emergency procedures. In addition, you should consider individual safety
issues, such as medical limitations and level of ability. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.10. Physical
Fitness Standard: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">18.10.1. The Air Force uses a composite fitness
score based on aerobic fitness, muscular strength/endurance, and body
composition (using abdominal circumference measurements) to determine overall
fitness. Overall fitness is directly related to health risk, including risk of
disease (morbidity) and death (mortality). A composite score of 75 or greater,
in addition to meeting the minimum component scores, represents the minimum
accepted for health, fitness, and readiness levels. Health and readiness
benefits continue to increase as body composition improves and physical
activity and fitness levels increase. Members are encouraged to optimize their
readiness status and posture by improving their overall fitness. Age and
gender-specific fitness score charts are provided in AFI 36-2905, Attachment
10. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b> Meeting the minimum
component scores does not constitute the minimum points required to earn a
composite passing score. Scoring the minimum component values in all components
will not generate enough points to earn a composite score of 75 or greater. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">The minimum components are established to ensure members
test adequately in all components and avoid “asymmetrical fitness” (i.e.
excelling in some and disregarding others). </p>

<p class="msonormal28">18.10.2. Airmen will receive a composite score on a 0-100
scale based on the following maximum component scores: 60 points for aerobic
fitness assessment, 20 points for body composition, 10 points each for the
muscular fitness assessment components, push-ups and sit-ups. Use the following
formula to determine the score: composite score = total component points
achieved multiplied by 100 and divided by total possible points. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">18.10.3. Airmen with a medical profile prohibiting them
from performing one or more components of the fitness assessment will have a
composite score calculated on the tested components.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal25">18.10.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Exemptions.
</b>Biannually, members must complete a composite fitness assessment.
Exemptions are designed to categorize members as unable or unavailable to train
or test, for reasons beyond the control of the member or commander, for a
limited time period as outlined in AFI 36-2905. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">18.10.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Component
Exemptions.</b> The commander, in consultation with the fitness program
manager, may grant members exemption from aerobic and muscle fitness components
based on medical recommendation according to AFI 36-2905 for a time-limited
period. Other fitness assessment components will still be assessed. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">18.10.4. Composite scores represent a health-based
fitness level. As the fitness level increases, Airmen are able to tolerate
extremes in temperature, fatigue, and stress while optimizing performance in
the deployed environment. Refer to Table 18.1 for fitness levels. </p>

<p class="msonormal29">18.10.5. Members must have a current fitness score
on file prior to deployment. Member will not be considered “exempt” in the
deployed location until their current fitness assessment expires. If a member
fails their fitness assessment before deploying and their officer performance
report/enlisted performance report closes out after the deployment starts, the
commander has the discretion to annotate a non-current/failing fitness
assessment within the reporting period on the evaluation. Additionally, the
commander has the discretion to document the evaluation as a referral for a
noncurrent/failing fitness assessment at the evaluation close-out date or
enlisted performance report static close out date in accordance with AFI
36-2406, <i class="calibre2">Officer and Enlisted Evaluation
Systems</i>.<span class="calibre6">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal27">18.10.6. Any failures will be annotated in Air
Force fitness management system and will be considered against the individual.
However, if an Airman reaches the 91-day mark after the unsatisfactory fitness
assessment, but before the evaluation closes out, the unsatisfactory score is
no longer current and the commander has the discretion to annotate a
noncurrent/failing fitness assessment within the reporting period on the
evaluation. Additionally, the commander has the discretion to document the
evaluation as a referral for a non-current/failing fitness assessment at the
evaluation close-out date or enlisted performance report static close out date.
For Satisfactory and Excellent scores, deployed Airmen become “exempt” only
when they reach the first day of the month, seven/thirteen calendar months
following the previous official fitness assessment rating. </p>

Fitness Assessment: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">18.11.1. Installations will develop a local plan,
signed by the installation commander, for unit commanders to appoint physical
training leaders to augment the fitness assessment cell for the purpose of
administering fitness assessments. Fitness assessment cell augmentees will
conduct fitness assessments and designated fitness assessment cell personnel
will provide oversight. Fitness assessment cell augmentees <i class="calibre2">will not</i> test members from their own unit. The fitness assessment
cell will conduct the fitness assessments for all Airmen. Where no fitness
assessment cell exists, fitness assessments should be conducted by a certified
physical training leader from another unit; arrangements of this nature will be
determined by local leadership. </p>

<p class="msonormal38">18.11.2. The fitness screening questionnaire will
be completed no earlier than 30 calendar days (90 days for Air Reserve
Component, but no later than 7 days prior to the fitness assessment, to provide
time for medical evaluation, when indicated. Failure to complete the fitness
screening questionnaire does not invalidate the fitness assessment. </p>

<p class="msonormal27">18.11.3. Medical providers may recommend temporary
medical exemptions for medical conditions preventing an Airman from safely
participating in specific physical conditioning programs or in a component of
the fitness assessment. Assessment for participation in fitness activities
should be made at each visit to prevent the member from having to return for
clearance or exemption at a later date. </p>

<p class="msonormal39">18.11.4. Pregnant Airmen will engage in physical
activity to maintain cardiovascular and muscular fitness throughout the
pregnancy and postpartum period according to medical provider recommendations.
Exercise regimens will consist of routines inclusive of physical training and
nutrition counseling. Airmen are exempt from the fitness assessment during
pregnancy and for 180 days after the delivery date. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.12. Assessment
Procedures. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">All components of the fitness assessment must be
completed within a 3-hour window on the same day. If extenuating circumstances
occur (for example, rapidly changing or severe weather conditions, natural
disasters, emergencies, safety issues, etc.), then all components must be
completed within 5 duty days. Reserve members must be in a duty status for
fitness assessments. The body composition component is the first component of
the fitness assessment includes measuring height, weight, and abdominal
circumference which must be the first component assessed in the fitness
assessment. The muscular fitness components (push-ups and sit-ups) may be
accomplished before or after the 1.5-mile run or 2-kilometer walk. There is a
minimum 3-minute rest period between components. The assessment components
should be scheduled to allow adequate rest for members on irregular or shift
work hours. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">The run and walk will be performed on an approved
distance course. Aerobic fitness is measured with a 1.5-mile run, according to
procedures outlined in AFI 36-2905.<b class="calibre1"> </b>All
members will complete the 1.5-mile timed run unless medically exempted. Members
medically exempted from the run and cleared for an alternate assessment will,
upon recommendation by the exercise physiologist/fitness program manager,
complete the 2-kilometer walk, according to procedures in AFI 36-2905.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Airmen who perform the 2-kilometer
walk will not be allowed to run (that is, at least one foot must be in contact
with the ground at all times) or the fitness assessment will be terminated. The
2-kilometer walk is the only authorized alternative. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b> The member does not select the assessment method. The fitness
program manager determines which assessment to use based on the member’s
profile. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.12.3. <b class="calibre1">Muscular

<p class="msonormal8">18.14.3. <b class="calibre1">Physical
Training Leaders: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal40">18.14.3.1. The physical training leader completes
the initial physical training leader course before overseeing and conducting
the unit fitness program and maintains currency by receiving annual refresher
course or upon change of duty station, whichever comes first. Air Reserve
Component physical training leaders at co-located bases will receive initial
and refresher training from Regular Air Force fitness program managers. If not
feasible for Air Reserve Component physical training leaders to receive in

<p class="msonormal46">Overweight and obesity in the
United States has been declared a threat to National Security. Nearly 27% of 17
to 24 year olds are too overweight to serve in the military. The Department of
Defense is not immune as 48% of Airmen are assessed as overweight and 14%
obese. Imbalance of calorie intake and physical activity are the primary causes
for unintended weight gain and an increase potential health risk. Airmen are
responsible to be mission ready at all times and must recognize that food is
the fuel that supports our performance and ability to complete the mission. To
understand how nutrition affects the body, Airmen must understand the following
basic concepts: calories, the functions of nutrients, and how to customize
nutrient intake to support performance.<span class="calibre6">  </span></p>

MyPlate emphasizes fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods, and dairy groups
in appropriate portions. The United States Department of Agriculture’s website,
<a href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov/" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre36">www.choosemyplate.gov</span></a><a href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov/" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre39"> </span></a>has user-friendly tools and resources on

<p class="msonormal49">18.15.2.1. The Dietary
Guidelines for Americans summarizes and synthesizes knowledge about individual
nutrients and food into a set of recommendations for </p>

<p class="msonormal22">healthy eating. The 2015 version provides recommendations
under 5 main messages; (1) Follow a healthy eating </p>

<p class="msonormal7">pattern across the lifespan; (2) Focus on variety,
nutrient density, and amount; (3) Limit calories from added sugars and
saturated fats and reduce sodium intake; (4) Shift to healthier food and
beverage choices; (5) Support healthy eating patterns for all.<span class="calibre6">  </span>18.15.2.2. Maintaining a healthy weight is
key to Airmen’s’ health and readiness. The Air Force recognizes abdominal
circumference as one of the most specific indicators of disease risk in adults
because abdominal fat is a predictor of obesity-related diseases. In addition
to meeting military appearance standards, overweight and obese Airmen have
increased risk of high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, heart disease,
stroke, Type 2 diabetes, arthritis, breathing problems and certain types of
cancer. Gradual improvements in diet, physical activity and lifestyle are
easier to incorporate and more likely to be maintained. This can be achieved by
following the key dietary guideline recommendations to consume a healthy eating
pattern that accounts for all foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie
level. A healthy eating pattern includes: a variety of vegetables from all the
subgroups- dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans and peas), starchy, and
other; fruits, especially whole fruits; grains, at least half of which are
whole grains; fat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and/or
fortified soy beverages; a variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean
meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), and nuts, seeds and soy
products; oils.<span class="calibre6">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal23">18.15.2.3. Maintaining a healthy energy balance is
important. Calories from foods and beverages need to be balanced with calories
burned through metabolism and physical activity to meet weight goals—less
calories to lose weight, balanced calories to maintain weight and more calories
to gain weight. If weight loss is desired, creating a calorie deficit of
500-1000 calories a day through diet and/or exercise should lead to a healthy
weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week.

<p class="msonormal50">18.15.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Macronutrients.<span class="calibre6">  </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal22">Macronutrients make up the bulk of the diet and supply
energy as well as many essential nutrients. Carbohydrates and protein provide 4
calories per gram and fats provide 9 calories per gram.<span class="calibre6">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal50">18.15.2.4.1. <b class="calibre1">Carbohydrates.<span class="calibre6">  </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal40">18.15.2.4.1.1. Carbohydrates are the primary fuel
source your body uses during exercise. An appropriate amount of carbohydrates
is important to maintain glycogen stores for energy reserve. Carbohydrates
increase blood glucose levels and supply energy. Simple carbohydrates increase
blood glucose levels rapidly while complex carbohydrates increase blood glucose
levels slowly over a longer time. Simple carbohydrates are often found in
packaged or processed foods, examples are; table sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup,
honey, fruit drinks, soft drinks and candy. Added sugars are simple sugars
added to foods or beverages when they are processed or prepared and should
account for less than 10% of calories per day. Complex carbohydrates can be
found in fruits, breads, cereals, grains, milk and starchy vegetables
(potatoes, corn, peas, and squash). Healthy carbohydrates contain fiber and
whole grains and limited added sugars. The recommended serving size is about
the size of the palm of your hand and contains approximately 15 grams of
carbohydrate; sizes differ with sweets and vegetables. The general
recommendation for carbohydrate intake is 45-65% of total calories.<span class="calibre6">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal16">18.15.2.4.1.2. Fiber is classified as soluble or
insoluble. Soluble fiber attracts water and turns to gel during digestion.
Therefore, soluble fiber lowers low-density lipoprotein/bad cholesterol and
prolongs stomach emptying time so sugar is released and absorbed more slowly.
Additionally, fiber can be found in oatmeal, oat bran, nuts and seeds, dry
beans and peas, and most fruits. Insoluble fiber adds bulk to the stool and
helps food pass more quickly through the stomach and intestines. Finally, fiber
can be found in whole wheat bread, barley, brown rice, seeds, and in most
vegetables and fruits. The average American consumes 12-15 grams per day,
whereas the recommended total fiber intake is 20-35 grams per day. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.15.2.4.2.<b class="calibre1">
Protein.<span class="calibre6">  </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">Proteins are used by our bodies for tissue
maintenance, replacement, function and growth of our muscles. If our body is
not getting enough calories from dietary sources or tissue stores, protein may
be used for energy. The general recommendation for protein intake is 10-35% of
total calories or 0.8 to 1.2 grams/kilograms body weight to meet daily needs.
Protein can be found in meats, poultry, fish, legumes, tofu, eggs, nuts and
seeds, milk and milk products, and grains. Individuals should focus on lean
meats and low fat milk products to reduce saturated fats. The recommended
serving size of meat is the size of a deck of cards and contains about 21 grams
of protein. One 8 ounce glass of milk contains 8 grams of protein.<span class="calibre6">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal42"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.15.2.4.<b class="calibre1">
Fats.<span class="calibre6">  </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">18.15.2.4.1.<b class="calibre1">
</b>Fats are a major energy source and help our bodies maintain temperature and
protect organs from trauma. Balanced fat intake is essential to maintain energy
reserve. Fats can be found in oils, high fat cuts of meat, baked sweets,
whole-fat milk and cream, butter, cheeses, nuts and seeds, avocados, and fish.
The general recommendation for fats is 20-35% of total calories. The differences
between the four categories of fats are important to understand; saturated
fats, trans fats, polyunsaturated fats, and monounsaturated fats. </p>

<p class="msonormal51">18.15.2.4.2.<b class="calibre1">
</b>Diets higher in saturated fats have been linked to coronary heart disease.
Saturated fats should make up less than 10% of your daily calories, foods that
contain more saturated fats are usually solid at room temperate and can be
found in high-fat cheeses, high-fat cuts of meat, whole-fat milk and cream,
butter, ice cream, and palm and coconut oils. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">18.15.2.4.3. Trans fats have also been linked to
coronary heart disease and intake of these fats should be kept as low as
possible. They can be found in small amounts in the fatty parts of meat and
milk products and in foods that contain partially hydrogenated oils. Trans fats
can be made from vegetable oils through a process called hydrogenation and are
found in foods such as frozen pizzas, frozen pies, cookies, and margarine,
spreads and other processed foods. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">18.15.2.4.4.<b class="calibre1">
</b>Eating more unsaturated fan can reduce your risk for heart disease and
improve high-density lipoprotein/good cholesterol levels.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Unsaturated fats are typically liquid at room temperature and
include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats typically
come from plant sources such as canola oil, olive oil, nuts, seeds, flaxseed,
and avocado but is also present in fish such as trout, herring, and
salmon.<span class="calibre6">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.15.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Sodium. </b><span class="calibre6"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal9">Americans consume about 3,400 milligrams of sodium
every day, mostly in the form of salt found in processed foods- canned foods,
soups, cheese, bread, prepared mixes and deli meats. The Dietary Guidelines for
Americans recommends that adults limit their sodium intake to 2,300 mg per
day-about the amount in one teaspoon of table salt. Certain “at-risk” groups
including adults over the age of 51, African Americans, and people who have
high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney disease should limit their sodium
intake to about 1,500 milligrams per day. High sodium intake raises blood
pressure which is a major risk factor for the nation’s leading cause of death –
heart disease. The best way to ensure a low sodium diet is to eat whole foods
such as fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables; lean, unprocessed poultry and
fish; unsalted nuts; whole grains; and low-fat dairy products such as skim milk
or yogurt.<span class="calibre6">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.15.2.6. <b class="calibre1">Fluid. </b><span class="calibre6"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal23">Water is essential for life, in fact the body is made up
of over 60% water. Water has no calories and is needed to transport nutrients
throughout your body via blood plasma, while also assisting many of your body’s
other functions, including waste elimination. Depending on age, sex, race, and
body composition water needs differ. The exact percentage is different for
males and females and from one person to another with a range of 45-75%. Taking
these factors into account, daily water balance for each individual also
depends on the total difference between water gain and water loss. Water gains
occur from consumption of liquids, foods, and the body’s natural production of
water. Water losses occur from the following sources: sweat, respiration,
gastrointestinal, and renal. The body is in constant demand for water and this
demand increases when you exercise, when you are ill, and in environmental
conditions, such as humidity and altitude. For a generally healthy individual,
the Dietary Reference Intakes, recommend a total daily water consumption
(combination of drinking water, beverages, and food) for women, 19-70 years of
age, as 2.7 liters per day and for men, 19-70 years of age, as 3.7 liters per
day.<span class="calibre6">  </span></p>

<b class="calibre1">Caffeine.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal24">Caffeine is a stimulant present in a variety of
products including coffee, tea, colas, energy drinks, dietary supplements,
over-the-counter medications, and some foods. According to the Human
Performance Resource Center, daily caffeine intake up to 400 mg has been found
safe for healthy adults and non-pregnant/non-lactating women. Caffeine used in
moderation with a dose of up to 200 mg has been shown to improve cognitive
performance in individuals. A cup of coffee typically has 100 mg of caffeine.
Be aware that taking large doses of caffeine, roughly 400–500 mg, at one time
can result in a serious condition known as “caffeine intoxication.” Symptoms of
caffeine intoxication can include nausea, vomiting, agitation, nervousness, or
headache. Excessive caffeine intake can be life-threatening and could
potentially cause electrolyte imbalance or high levels of acid in the blood
which could cause seizures. </p>

<b class="calibre1">Energy Drinks versus Sport Drinks. </b><span class="calibre6"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal7">Energy drinks and sports drinks are both marketed
by manufacturers to improve performance. Evidence as to the effect of energy
drinks on athletic performance is inconsistent. Be aware, case studies have
reported seizures after heavy consumption of energy drinks. Energy drinks
usually carry a “warning” due to the use of stimulants such as caffeine, green
tea extract, guarana seed extract, yerba mate, acacia rigidula, taurine,
ginseng or other proprietary “energy boost blends.” Proprietary blends can
contain novel, untested ingredients, along with botanicals, amino acids,
proteins, peptides, or extracts. Additionally, vitamins and minerals (e.g.
B-vitamins and magnesium) may be added, leading to excessive intakes. Energy
drinks are not meant to hydrate. Sports drinks, or carbohydrateelectrolyte
beverages, are designed to hydrate and do not contain caffeine unless otherwise
stated. Sports drinks generally contain a mixture of carbohydrates (14 to 19
grams per 8-ounce serving), sodium (115-175 mg per 8ounce serving), and
potassium (20-98 milligrams per 8-ounce serving) which has been shown to improve
exercise performance. If eight liters of sweat are lost per day or higher
intensity exercise lasts greater than 60 minutes, a carbohydrate-electrolyte
beverage may be needed. In conclusion, the safest solution is to avoid energy
supplements and learn more about electrolytes and carbohydrate fueling
strategies to decide which sport drink (not energy drink) is the best choice
for you. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.15.2.9. <b class="calibre1">Alcohol.
</b><span class="calibre6"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Excessive drinking can be harmful to your health
and may increase the risk for high blood pressure, liver cirrhosis and several
forms of cancer. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans advise limiting alcohol
to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. The serving size
for beer is 12 ounces, wine is 5 ounces and 80 proof distilled spirits is 1.5
ounces. The average serving of alcohol generally has about 150 calories.
Additionally, alcohol has 7 calories per gram and can be a significant
contributor caloric consumption in the diet. Alcohol may lead to excess weight
gain, increased risk for chronic diseases, osteoporosis, stress injuries, and
impaired short and long term cognitive function.<span class="calibre6">   </span></p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.15.3.<b class="calibre1"> Performance
Nutrition Basics.<span class="calibre6">  </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal51">Nutrition plays an important role in maintaining
health and performance, particularly exercise. This next section builds upon
the basic nutrition principles and focuses on fueling strategies that will help
enhance and optimize physical performance. The basics of performance nutrition
focus on fluid hydration and timing of fueling strategies (before, during, and
after exercise).<span class="calibre6">    </span><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre6"> </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal54"><span class="calibre40"><span class="calibre6">               </span></span><span class="calibre6"> </span><span class="calibre6">           </span>18.15.3.1.
<b class="calibre1">Fluid Requirements with Exercise. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">Exercise substantially increases fluid loss,
placing greater demands on fluid replacement; so that proper hydration before,
during, and after intense workouts is critical. Decrements in performance
starts to occur with fluid losses of 2% of body weight degrades both cognitive
and mental performance. One liter of water is equivalent to 1 kilogram (2.2
pounds) of body weight. An example would be a 150 pound individual losing 3
pounds of body weight through sweat losses which would equate to 1.36 liters of
fluid. During exercise, sweat rate losses can vary from 0.3-2.4 liters. Fluid losses
are dependent on exercise intensity, genetic predisposition, fitness status,
acclimation of heat, altitude, clothing, and other environmental conditions.
Dehydration occurs with fluid losses of greater than 2% of body weight and
increases risk for heat illness, exhaustion and stroke. In general, for
activities less than 60 minutes, water is the best beverage for hydration. If
you are doing more than 60 minutes of continuous exercise, then you may benefit
from a sports drink to replace electrolytes and carbohydrates. Also know that a
while dehydration can affect performance and be life threatening, the same can
occur on the opposite end of the spectrum with excess fluid consumption. Excess
fluid can lead to over-hydration resulting in symptoms such as chills,
vomiting, dizziness, disorientation, altered mental status, fatigue, headache,
and even death. According to the United States Army Research Institute of
Environmental Medicine, regardless of how hot it is or how hard you are
working, you should limit fluids to no more than 6 cups an hour and 48 cups a
day. The key with fluid intake is to aim to replace losses and monitor signs
and symptoms of under/over hydration. Determine how much water is lost by
taking a weight measurement (without clothes/gear) before and after a hard
training workout. Drink 16 ounces of fluid for every pound of weight lost. </p>

<p class="msonormal55"><span class="calibre40"><span class="calibre6">               </span></span><span class="calibre6"> </span><span class="calibre6">           </span>18.15.3.2.
<b class="calibre1">Pre-, During, and Post-event Eating
Strategies. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal22">Following appropriate eating strategies based on event
timing and exercise intensity can help improve performance.<span class="calibre6">  </span>Avoid drastic changes in diet before a
fitness test or mission; try out new foods and strategies during training
times. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">18.15.3.2.1.<b class="calibre1">
Pre-exercise: </b>The purpose of a pre-exercise beverage, snack or meal is to
provide enough fluid to maintain hydration and enough carbohydrates to maintain
proper blood sugar levels during activity. A pre-exercise meal (includes some
carbs, protein and low or moderate fat) should be consumed 3 to 4 hours before
starting the activity. This allows time for the body to digest the food. A
small amount of protein before exercise may reduce muscle soreness later.
Pre-exercise snacks/beverages should be consumed 30 to 60 minutes before an
activity. The snacks and beverages consumed one hour before should contain mainly
carbohydrates since they are digested quickly and turned to energy-giving
glucose. Snack examples are bananas or other fruits (grapes, applesauce, and
peaches), graham crackers, pretzels, or low fiber dry cereal. Avoid foods with
fat and fiber in a pre-exercise snack to minimize possibility of an upset
stomach. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">18.15.3.2.2. <b class="calibre1">During
Exercise: </b>During exercise duration of less than 45 minutes, carbohydrate
consumption is not warranted. In sustained high intensity exercise with a
duration of 45-75 minutes, small amounts of carbohydrates during activity
(sports drinks and products) may enhance performance, but does not provide a
source of fuel. During endurance exercise of 1-2.5 hours in length,
carbohydrate intake provides a source of fuel. The recommended intake of
carbohydrates for events 1-2.5 hours in length is 30-60 grams per hour. In
ultra-endurance events, greater than 2.5-3 hours in length, carbohydrate
intakes of up to 90 grams per hour can improve performance.<span class="calibre6">    </span></p>

<p class="msonormal56">18.15.3.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Post-exercise/Recovery:
</b>If exercising at a low or moderate intensity for less than a half hour a
post workout beverage or snack is not necessary. However, if the exercise
routine is rigorous and lasts for more than 45 minutes, a snack or light meal
will help in recovery. This “recovery” meal helps replenish the carbohydrates
burned during exercise and converts them into a storage form (glycogen) for
later use. Adding protein to the meal or snack helps rebuild muscle tears that
occur during exercise. Following exhaustive exercise a minimum of 24 hours is
required to replace the glycogen stores lost in training. Timing and the ratio
of carbohydrate to protein are also important factors to consider. The critical
window of refueling is within 45 minutes of finishing your exercise. High
glycemic foods are the most effective for restoring glycogen. An optimal
composition of a post recovery beverage or snack is a 4:1 carbohydrate to
protein ratio. This means that for every 4 grams of carbohydrates there should
be 1 gram of protein. A great example is the recovery beverage chocolate milk.
A regular 8 ounce glass of chocolate milk contains about 29 grams of
carbohydrates and 8 grams of protein, a 3.6:1 carbohydrate/protein ratio. In
contrast, a regular 8 ounce glass of milk contains 12 grams of carbohydrates
and 8 grams of protein, a 1.5:1 carbohydrate/protein ratio. Other examples of
simple post-workout snacks include low fat yogurt, trail mix (cereal, nuts and
dried fruit) and water, or string cheese and a fruit bar with water. Hydration
repletion should also be a priority. Recovery fluids should include sodium and
potassium. Examples of these types of fluids are: water, juices, sports
beverages, coffee, tea, soups, and water containing foods such as fruits and
vegetables. </p>

<p class="msonormal58">18.15.3.3.1. The use of dietary supplements
continues to be popular among members of the military. The term dietary
supplement includes many products, such as vitamins, minerals, herbs,
botanicals, amino acids, or other substances, and are sold as pills, powders,
bars, packs, gels, drinks, or shakes. The Food and Drug Administration does not
test products before they are sold in stores or via the internet; this lack of
oversight means there is no guarantee that what you purchase is what you get.
Knowing the “red flags” when choosing a dietary supplement is important. First,
be aware that the most popular types of supplements- bodybuilding, performance
enhancement, sexual enhancement, and weight loss products, are the ones most
likely to be “tainted” with prescription drugs, heavy metals, or other
undeclared ingredients. Second, avoid products that have ingredients listed as
“blends,” “proprietary blends,” or “delivery systems” on the label. These
blends do not specify the amount of each ingredient in the blend and increase
the risk of overdosing on ingredients such as creatine or caffeine. Third, be
wary of products that promise a “quick fix” or amazing results that seem too
good to be true. Fortunately, there are third party verification/certification
companies that will test the purity and/or quality of the product, so look for
those types of labels on your products (Figure 18.3). Remember, climate and
stress may alter the effects of dietary supplements, especially in a deployed
environment which can increase the risk of having a bad reaction to a product. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.16. Alcohol and
Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Drug Demand Reduction Programs: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal61">18.16.1. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and
Treatment and Drug Demand Reduction programs include substance use/misuse
prevention, education, treatment, and urinalysis testing. Substance use/misuse
prevention and treatment policies and programs are thoroughly integrated into
every facet of Air Force core values, quality of life, and force management.
These policies have been in place for over two decades and have evolved to meet
changing conditions within the Air Force. Our members are held to the highest
standards of discipline and behavior, both on and off duty. Individuals who
experience problems related to substance use/misuse will receive counseling and
treatment as needed; however, all Air Force members are held accountable for
unacceptable behavior. </p>

<p class="msonormal62">18.16.2. The Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and
Treatment Program objectives are to promote readiness, health, and wellness
through the prevention and treatment of substance misuse and abuse; minimize
the negative consequences of substance misuse and abuse to the individual,
family, and organization; provide comprehensive education and treatment to
individuals who experience problems attributed to substance misuse or abuse, to
restore function and return identified substance abusers to unrestricted duty
status or assist them in their transition to civilian life. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.17. Policy on Drug
Abuse: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal39">18.17.1. Department of Defense policy is to prevent
and eliminate drug and alcohol abuse and dependence from the Department of
Defense. Such abuse and dependence are incompatible with readiness, the
maintenance of high standards of performance, and military discipline. Drug
abuse is defined as the illegal, wrongful, or improper use, possession, sale,
transfer, or introduction onto a military installation of any drug defined in
AFI 90-507<i class="calibre2">, Military Drug Demand
Reduction Program. </i>“Wrongful” means without legal justification or excuse. </p>

<p class="msonormal38">18.17.2. Studies have shown that products made with
hemp seed and hemp seed oil may contain varying levels of tetrahydrocannabinol,
an active ingredient of marijuana which is detectable under the Air Force Drug
Testing Program. To ensure military readiness, the ingestion of products
containing or products derived from hemp seed or hemp seed oil is prohibited.
Failure by military personnel to comply with the prohibition on the ingestion
of products containing or products derived from hemp seed or hemp seed oil is a
violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice. </p>

<p class="msonormal39">18.17.3. To ensure military readiness, safeguard
the health and wellness of the force, and to maintain good order and discipline
in the Service, the knowing use of any intoxicating substance, other than the
lawful use of alcohol or nicotine products, that is inhaled, injected,
consumed, or introduced into the body in any manner to alter mood or function,
is prohibited. These substances include, but are not limited to, controlled
substance analogues (for example, designer drugs such as “spice” that are not
otherwise controlled substances); inhalants, propellants, solvents, household
chemicals, and other substances used for “huffing;” prescription or
over-the-counter medications when used in a manner contrary to their intended
medical purpose or in excess of the prescribed dosage; and naturally occurring
intoxicating substances (for example, Salvia divinorum). The possession of any
intoxicating substance described in this paragraph, if done with the intent to
use in a manner that would alter mood or function, is prohibited. Failure by
military personnel to comply with the prohibitions contained in this paragraph
is a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">18.17.4. All patients diagnosed with a substance use
disorder and entered into the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.18. Policy on
Alcohol Abuse. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal61">Air Force policy recognizes that alcohol abuse
negatively affects public behavior, duty performance, and/or physical and

31-116 establishes guidance on court hearing procedures, convictions,
non-judicial punishment, civilian administrative action, or appropriate
punishment for violation of impaired and intoxicated driving policies. If a
member has a blood alcohol percentage of 0.05 but less than 0.10, the person is
presumed to be impaired. Intoxicated driving is operating a motor vehicle under
intoxication caused by alcohol or drugs. There is a 1-year driving privilege
suspension for driving or being in physical control of a motor vehicle while
under the influence of intoxicating liquor 0.10 percent or greater. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b> In the United States, if a state
uses a more stringent standard (for example, 0.08 instead of 0.10), Air Force
units will use the lower standard. Overseas, the limit is 0.10 unless the

and Referring Personnel for Substance Use and Abuse: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal40">18.19.1.1. Each person is responsible for
exercising good judgment in the use of alcohol when not otherwise restricted by
public law or military directive. The Air Force reviews members’ drinking
habits that affect public behavior, duty performance, or physical and mental
health. The Air Force provides non-punitive assistance to members seeking help
for an alcohol problem. In assessing potential drug- and alcohol-related
problems, the supervisory role is to identify subordinates with problems early
and to motivate them to seek and accept help. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">18.19.1.2. As depicted in Figure 18.4, many signs
and symptoms of substance use/misuse exist. However, the presence of these
signs, though common indicators of substance use/misuse, does not always
substantiate a substance use problem. To note all the behavioral symptoms that
may suggest substance use/abuse or precisely define their sequence and severity
is impossible. They are exactly as stated—signs and symptoms. Do not use these
signs to make a conclusive substance use diagnosis. This responsibility lies
with the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program personnel. If
any of these signs are present, it may suggest a potential problem exists for
the member. Talk with the member and explain why you are concerned. Fear of
discussing concerns is normal, but discussing the concern is important to
address the concern early before the problem gets out of control. Document and
discuss specific instances of unusual behavior with the supervisor, first
sergeant, or unit commander. This will help expedite the care a subordinate may
need. When additional professional assistance is needed, do not hesitate to
document and then refer troubled subordinates to the Alcohol and Drug Abuse
Prevention and Treatment Program. <b class="calibre1">Note:<i class="calibre2"> </i></b>Help must be offered to every

<p class="msonormal8">18.19.2. <b class="calibre1">Identifying
Individuals with Substance use Disorders or Misuse. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal67">For the Air Force to have an effective substance
use prevention and treatment program, there must be a means of identifying
service members experiencing problems with substance use. Although commanders
play a major role in identifying substance abusers, members should be aware of
how commanders must proceed in various circumstances. Due to the nature of the
position noncommissioned officers hold within the unit, they also play an
important part in the identification process. There are basically five identification
methods: </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.19.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Medical
Care Referrals. </b>Medical personnel must notify the unit commander and the
Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment program manager when a member: </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.19.2.1.1. Is observed, identified, or suspected to be
under the influence of drugs or alcohol while seeking medical care. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.19.2.1.2. Receives treatment for an injury or illness
that may be the result of substance use/misuse. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.19.2.1.3. Is suspected of abusing substances. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.19.2.1.4. Is admitted as a patient for alcohol or drug
detoxification. </p>

<p class="msonormal25">18.19.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Commander’s
Identification.</b> Unit commanders will refer all service members for
assessment when substance use or misuse is suspected to be a contributing
factor in any misconduct; for example, driving under the influence, public
intoxication, drunk and disorderly, spouse or child abuse and maltreatment,
underage drinking, positive drug test, or when notified by medical personnel.
When commanders or supervisors fail to refer a member with suspected or
identified substance use problems, this places the member at increased risk for
developing more severe substance use problems and may jeopardize the safety of
others and ultimately mission accomplishment. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">18.19.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Drug
Testing. </b>The Air Force conducts drug testing of personnel according to AFI
90-507, <i class="calibre2">Military Drug Demand Reduction
Program</i>.<i class="calibre2"> </i>Drug testing is most
effective as a deterrent. Therefore, Air Force military members are subject to
testing regardless of grade, status, or position. Inspection testing is the
best deterrent presently available against drug abuse. Military members may
receive an order or voluntarily consent to provide urine samples at any time.
Military members who fail to comply with an order to provide a urine sample are
subject to punitive action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
Commander-directed testing should only be used as a last resort because the
results cannot be used in actions under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, <span class="calibre5">or </span>administrative actions,
including adverse characterization of administrative discharges such as
(General) or under other than honorable conditions. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">18.19.2.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Inspection
under Military Rule of Evidence 313. </b>Inspection testing is the most common
method of testing in the Air Force. Drug testing is random and unpredictable.
In general, an inspection is an examination conducted as an incident of
command, the primary purpose of which is to determine and ensure the security,
military fitness, or good order and discipline of the unit, organization, or
installation. Individuals are selected at random using a nonbiased selection
process. Commanders may also select work sections, units, or segments of the
military population to provide urine samples. Commanders may use the positive
result of a urine sample to refer a member for a substance use evaluation, as
evidence to support disciplinary action under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice or administrative discharge action, and as a consideration on the issue
of characterization of discharge in administrative discharges. </p>

<p class="msonormal43">18.19.2.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Probable
Cause. </b>Probable cause<b class="calibre1"> </b>requires a
search and seizure authorization from the appropriate commander to seize a
urine specimen. Probable cause exists when there is a reasonable belief that
drugs will be found in the system of the member to be tested. Consult with the
staff judge advocate regarding procedures for determining whether probable
cause exists. Results may be used for Uniform Code of Military Justice or to
characterize administrative discharges. </p>

<p class="msonormal67">18.19.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Medical
Purposes. </b>Results of any examination conducted for a valid medical purpose
including emergency medical treatment, periodic physical examination, and other
such examinations necessary for diagnostic or treatment purposes may be used to
identify drug abusers. Results may be used as evidence to support disciplinary
action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or administrative discharge
action according to AFI 90-507, Table 7.1. These results may also be considered
on the issue of characterization of discharge in separation proceedings. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">18.19.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Self-identification.
</b>Air Force members with substance use problems are encouraged to seek
assistance from the unit commander, first sergeant, substance use counselor, or
a military medical professional. Selfidentification is reserved for members who
are not currently under investigation or pending action because of an
alcohol-related incident. Following the assessment, the Alcohol and Drug Abuse
Prevention and Treatment program manager will consult with the treatment team
and determine an appropriate clinical course of action. </p>

<p class="msonormal68">18.19.2.5.1. <b class="calibre1">Drugs.</b>
An Air Force member may voluntarily disclose evidence of personal drug use or
possession to the unit commander, first sergeant, substance use counselor, or a
military medical professional. Commanders will grant limited protection for Air
Force members who reveal this information with the intention of entering
treatment. Commanders may not use voluntary disclosure against a member in an
action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or when weighing
characterization of service in a separation. Disclosure is not voluntary if the
Air Force member has previously been: </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.19.2.5.1.1. Apprehended for drug involvement. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">18.19.2.5.1.2. Placed under investigation for drug
abuse. The day and time when a member is considered placed under investigation
is determined by the circumstances of each individual case. A member is under
investigation, for example, when an entry is made in the security forces blotter,
when the security forces investigator’s log shows an initial case entry, or
when the Air Force Office of Special Investigations opens a case file.
Furthermore, a member is considered under investigation when he or she has been
questioned about drug use by investigative authorities or the member’s
commander, or when an allegation of drug use has been made against the member. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.19.2.5.1.3. Ordered to give a urine sample as part of
the drug-testing program in which the results are still pending or have been
returned as positive. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.19.2.5.1.4. Advised of a recommendation for
administrative separation for drug abuse. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.19.2.5.1.5. Entered into treatment for drug abuse. </p>

<p class="msonormal43">18.19.2.5.2. <b class="calibre1">Alcohol.</b>
Commanders must provide sufficient incentive to encourage members to seek help
for problems with alcohol without fear of negative consequences.
Self-identified members will enter the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and
Treatment assessment process and will be held to the same standards as others
entering substance use education, counseling, and treatment programs. </p>

<p class="msonormal42"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal69"><b class="calibre1">18.20. Leadership Responsibilities. </b>The supervisor’s role in the
treatment process does not end with identifying and referring members. Though
the supervisor is not charged with providing treatment, daily interaction with
his or her personnel and the treatment team can have a significant impact on
the success of the treatment efforts. Identifying individuals who need
treatment is a critical first step in helping them break free of the
tremendously potent cycle of denial, negativity, and increased substance use.
However, entering treatment is only a first step. A member’s substance use
problem did not develop overnight and took time, as will treatment and
recovery. The supervisor must remain focused on the member’s duty performance,
attendance in the program, and maintenance of standards. One of the most
critical components to a member’s treatment is the treatment team meeting.
Commander and/or first sergeant and supervisor involvement in the treatment
team meeting at key points in the patient’s treatment and recovery are
important. The commander or first sergeant and the supervisor must be involved
at program entry, termination, and anytime there are significant treatment
difficulties with the patient. The primary objective of the treatment team is
to guide the clinical course of the patient’s treatment after examining all the
facts. The treatment team consists of the commander, supervisor, member’s
counselor, medical consultants, other appropriate helping agencies, and the
member. </p>

<p class="msonormal70"><b class="calibre1">18.21. Substance Use
Assessment. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal71">The central purpose of the substance use assessment
is to determine the patient’s need for treatment and level of care required.
Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment staff members conduct the
substance use assessment within seven calendar days of notification. Alcohol
and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment program managers conduct required
reviews of the patient’s medical records and all documentation provided by the
Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment staff on a priority basis.
Information gathered during the assessment will form the basis for patient
diagnosis, treatment planning, and delivery of substance use services. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.22. Substance Use
Treatment. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">Substance use treatment is divided into two services:
nonclinical and clinical. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.22.1. <b class="calibre1">Nonclinical
Services. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">All active duty members involved in alcohol-related
misconduct will be referred for a substance use assessment. Members who do not
meet diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder will receive alcohol
counseling targeted (secondary) prevention and education. All decisions about
length and number of visits of targeted prevention and education will be based
on thorough assessment and determination of risk and is tailored for the
individual. There will be at least two follow-up appointments of a minimum of
30 minutes duration to reassess risk, assess progress, and as appropriate,
conduct a follow-up review of the educational components. If the client is
assessed to need more services, there should be follow-ups with progress
updates depending on the client’s needs. The focus of these appointments is not
treatment. They are designed to be targeted (individual) prevention, education,
and reassessment. In addition to the initial assessment, a required alcohol
education module will be completed within 2 weeks following the assessment. The
alcohol education module includes information on Air Force policy,
understanding the relationship between consumption, metabolism and
intoxication, and physiological effects of alcohol on brain and body. </p>

<p class="msonormal72">18.22.1.1. Additional counseling addressing
bio-psychosocial issues identified in the assessment may be prescribed. Length
of involvement will be determined based on the patient’s presenting problems
and agreed-upon treatment or behavioral contract. </p>

<p class="msonormal73">18.22.1.2. Individuals being processed for separation are
provided appropriate medical care <span class="calibre5">(e.g., detoxification) </span>before separation. Separation action is not
postponed because of a member’s participation in the Alcohol and Drug Abuse
Prevention and Treatment Program. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.22.2. <b class="calibre1">Clinical
Services: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal68">18.22.2.1. Patients meeting the Diagnostic
Statistical Manual 5 diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder will be
entered into substance use treatment with the level and intensity of care
determined by the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment program
manager using current American Society of Addiction Medicine criteria. The
philosophy is to place personnel with substance use problems in the least
intensive or restrictive treatment environment possible appropriate to their
therapeutic needs. </p>

<p class="msonormal74">18.22.2.2. Depending on the member’s needs,
variable lengths of stay or duration of treatment are provided within an array
of treatment settings. The treatment program will reflect a multidisciplinary
approach to assist the patient to achieve full recovery, free of the negative
effect of the substance use. Treatment plans are individually tailored to meet
patient’s needs. Family involvement is strongly encouraged. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">18.22.2.3. Individuals diagnosed with a substance
use disorder<i class="calibre2"> </i>will refrain from the
use of alcohol during the initial phase of treatment and are strongly
encouraged to continue to abstain during aftercare. Total abstinence is a
critical treatment goal; however, because of the nature of alcoholism, relapses
into drinking behavior are not uncommon and should be anticipated. A relapse by
itself is not sufficient reason for program failure; however, relapses must be
considered a significant threat to the patient’s treatment and dealt with
appropriately. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.22.2.4. Involvement in self-help recovery groups (such
as 12-step, rational recovery) is encouraged as an adjunct to treatment. The
frequency of attendance is determined by the treatment team with the patient. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.23. Detoxification
Prior to Treatment. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">Patients being referred for inpatient treatment
will be assessed to determine the level of detoxification services required. To
the greatest extent possible, patient detoxification will be managed on an
outpatient basis prior to inpatient treatment. Patients assessed as requiring
medically managed detoxification (inpatient) will be entered into an
appropriate medical facility. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.24. Completing the
Program: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.24.1. <b class="calibre1">Successful
Completion.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal40">Patients will not be considered to have
successfully completed treatment until they meet the Diagnostic Statistical
Manual criteria for early full remission. Based on Diagnostic Statistical
Manual criteria, the treatment team determines patient progress toward
agreed-upon goals and issues as stated in the treatment plan and determines
when the patient is effectively in recovery and no longer requires program
resources. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.24.2. <b class="calibre1">Failing the
Program: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal40">18.24.2.1. The treatment team determines a patient
to have failed the program based on a demonstrated pattern of unacceptable
behavior, inability, or unwillingness to comply with their treatment plan, or
involvement in alcohol or drug-related incidents after receiving initial
treatment. The determination a patient has failed treatment is based on the
patient’s repeated failure to meet and maintain Air Force standards (behavior),
rather than solely on the use of alcohol. An individual who has failed the
Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program will be considered for
administrative separation by his or her commander. </p>

<p class="msonormal44">18.24.2.2. Decisions regarding aftercare services
will be based on a current assessment of status and will include establishment
of an aftercare treatment plan identifying specific goals, interventions, and
means to assess interventions. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.25. Management of
Personnel with Substance use Disorders. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">The commander is responsible for all personnel and
administrative actions pertaining to patients involved in the Alcohol and Drug
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program, to include assignment availability,
promotion eligibility, reenlistment eligibility, Personnel Reliability Program,
security clearance, etc. Application of administrative restrictions should be
based on the establishment of an unfavorable information file or control roster
resulting from the member’s unacceptable behavior and not solely based on their
involvement in the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.26. The Line of
Duty Determination. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">A member’s substance use misconduct can lead to a
line of duty determination. A line of duty determination is a finding made
after an investigation into the circumstances of a member’s illness, injury,
disease, or death. The finding concludes: (1) whether or not the illness;
injury, or disease existed prior to service and if an existed prior to service
condition was aggravated by military service; (2) whether or not the illness,
injury, disease, or death occurred while the member was absent from duty; and
(3) whether or not the illness, injury, disease, or death was due to the
member’s own misconduct. The line of duty determination protects the interests
of both the member and the United States Government. A line of duty
determination may impact disability retirement and severance pay, forfeiture of
pay, period of enlistment, as well as veteran benefits. Additional guidance may
be found in AFI 36-2910, <i class="calibre2">Line of Duty
(Misconduct) Determination. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 18E—Tobacco Use </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.27. Air Force Goal
for Tobacco Use. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">The Air Force’s goal is a tobacco-free force. Tobacco use is
the single most preventable cause of disease and death in the United States.
Every year, in the United States, tobacco use is responsible for about 1 in 5
deaths (at least 480,000 deaths per year, of which an estimated 41,000 of these
deaths are from secondhand smoke exposure). </p>

<p class="msonormal20"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal21"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.28. Effects of
Tobacco Use: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal26">18.28.1. Optimal health and total fitness are force
multipliers and critical to the military mission. Tobacco use, including but
not limited to cigarettes, cigars, spit tobacco (also known as smokeless
tobacco or “chew”), and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), is inconsistent
with the Air Force’s goal of a mission-ready, healthy and fit force. Tobacco
use affects all bodily systems, not just the mouth and lungs. Some types of
cancer, cardiovascular diseases and many types of other diseases, have been
linked to tobacco use. For the military member, tobacco use decreases
endurance, night vision and fine motor coordination (for example, the
coordination needed to hold a weapon steady), increases the risk of injuries
(such as fractures) and post-operative respiratory complications, and impairs
(or slows) wound healing. Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency
classifies tobacco smoke as a class “A” carcinogen. This means smoking causes
cancer. Smoking is an obvious cancer threat to the smoker; but, more
importantly, it poses a cancer threat to the individual who chooses not to
smoke. Tobacco not only harms the user but can also cause cancer or contribute
to cardiovascular disease in those who breathe the exhaled smoke called
environmental tobacco smoke. </p>

<p class="msonormal71">18.28.2. While studies by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health have shown a
decline in cigarette smoking, the use of other forms of tobacco has
significantly increased. The increased use of smokeless tobacco is based on the
faulty assumption of less hazardous. Smokeless tobacco actually contains 28
different cancercausing agents (carcinogens). Oral cancers affect 30,000 people
annually, and one person dies every hour as a result of this disease. The
5-year survival rate is very low. Only 50 percent of persons are alive at 5
years after diagnosis. </p>

<p class="msonormal26">18.28.3. Nicotine found in tobacco products is addictive.
Nearly one-half of all smokers in the United States have tried to quit in the
past year. Because of the powerful physical and psychological addiction,
quitting can be a challenge. The longer one uses tobacco, the more difficult
cessation can be. Therefore, never using products containing nicotine is the
best prevention. The United States Surgeon General has found that nearly 100
percent of adults who smoke every day started smoking when they were 26 years
of age or younger, reinforcing prevention in our younger Airmen is critical to
reducing tobacco prevalence in the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal75"><b class="calibre1">18.29. Cost of Tobacco
use to the Air Force. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal76">The significant costs associated with tobacco use
are both physical and financial. TRICARE has estimated that tobacco use costs
the Department of Defense $1.7 billion annually because of increased healthcare
utilization and decreased work productivity (due to smoking breaks and
illness). No less significant is the fact that the cost of smoking a pack a day
for a year is 1-month’s base pay for an Airman Basic. </p>

<p class="msonormal77"><b class="calibre1">18.30. Air Force
Standards. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">AFI 40-102, <i class="calibre2">Tobacco
Use in the Air Force</i>, expands tobacco-free environments. Tobacco use on a
military installation is restricted to designated tobacco areas. Tobacco use is
prohibited on military treatment facility campuses; within 50 feet of a
building entry, sidewalk, or parking lot; within 100 feet of a playground; on
all recreational facilities, including athletic complexes, golf courses, and
beaches; in all lodging rooms, lodging and unaccompanied housing common areas,
and temporary lodging facility units; and family housing if serviced by a
common air-handling unit. Installation commanders are authorized to designate
all unaccompanied housing as nonsmoking. The Air Force prohibits all students
in technical training, accession, and graduate medical education programs from
using tobacco products while in duty uniform, and prohibits tobacco use at all
times during basic military training. Not using tobacco should be the Air Force
norm to promote mission readiness, health, and productivity. Commanders are
expected to support Airmen trying to quit tobacco products. Installation health
promotion programs provide strategies for education, motivation, and
intervention to discourage tobacco use. Formal, structured tobacco cessation
programs designed to assist members in breaking the addiction to tobacco
products are available. </p>

survivors, plus certain former spouses entitled to TRICARE benefits. TRICARE
programs are also available to Air Reserve Component members and their
families. TRICARE is a force multiplier for the military health system that
fills gaps in military health care using networks of civilian health care
professionals, facilities, pharmacies, and suppliers. These civilian networks
help enable the Department of Defense to provide beneficiaries with access to
high-quality health care services even while uniformed medics are serving
abroad in contingency operations. Comprehensive, current information on the

for each depends on the sponsor’s military status and residence. The three
primary health care options offered to eligible beneficiaries are TRICARE
Prime, TRICARE Standard, and TRICARE Extra. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.36.1. <b class="calibre1">TRICARE
Prime. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal40">TRICARE Prime is the managed care option and offers
the most affordable and comprehensive health coverage to beneficiaries. Active
duty members and their families do not pay enrollment fees, annual deductibles,
or copays for care, unless they seek care in the network without a primary care
manager referral. Each Prime enrollee is assigned a primary care manager who is
responsible for providing routine, non-emergency, and urgent health care. The
primary care manager is responsible for submitting referrals for specialty care
and establishing medical necessity when needed. The primary care manager also
coordinates with the regional TRICARE contractor, when necessary, to find
specialists in the network. TRICARE Prime also has time and distance standards
for urgent, routine, and specialty care to ensure beneficiaries can
conveniently access care when the care is needed. Other Prime benefits include
travel reimbursement for some specialty care, and a point-of-service option
that permits enrollees to seek care from any provider without a referral;
however, the point-of-service option carries significantly higher deductibles
and cost shares then those under TRICARE Standard. TRICARE Prime is the only
health plan option available to active duty service members. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">18.36.1.1. <b class="calibre1">TRICARE

<p class="msonormal51">18.36.1.1.1. <b class="calibre1">Active
Duty Service Members.</b> Uniformed service members on extended active duty
orders who meet TRICARE Prime Remote qualifications are required to enroll in
TRICARE Prime Remote. In some cases where geographic boundaries create undue
hardship for travel, active duty service members living closer than 50 miles
may be eligible for TRICARE Prime Remote. </p>

Prime Remote-enrolled sponsors are eligible for TRICARE Prime Remote for active
duty family members and must enroll to enjoy the benefit. Family members
enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote for active duty family members may remain
enrolled even if the sponsor receives unaccompanied permanent change of station

<p class="msonormal8">18.36.2. <b class="calibre1">TRICARE
Standard and Extra and TRICARE Overseas Program Standard. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">TRICARE Standard and Extra are fee-for-service
plans available to eligible non-active duty beneficiaries throughout the United
States. TRICARE Standard is the stateside program and TRICARE Overseas Program
Standard is the overseas program. Enrollment is not required and coverage is
automatic as long as the beneficiary is eligible and registered in the Defense
Eligibility and Enrollment System. When using TRICARE Standard and Extra, the
beneficiary may visit any TRICARE-authorized provider within the network or
outside the network. Care within military medical treatment facilities is on a
space-available basis only. Referrals for health care are not needed under
these two health plans, but some services may require prior authorization. The
network status of the provider being seen determines whether the beneficiary
will be charged copays under TRICARE Standard or TRICARE Extra. When visiting a
non-network provider, the Standard option is being used and Standard copays
apply. When visiting a network provider, the Extra option is being used and the
beneficiary will pay less out of pocket as compared to non-network providers.
Additionally, when using network providers, the provider will file all medical
claims on behalf of the beneficiary and the beneficiary will not be liable for
any charges outside of the TRICARE copay and deductible. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.38. Suicide
Defined. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines
suicide as death caused by self-directed injurious behavior with an intent to
die as a result of the behavior. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.39. Suicide
Demographics. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal26">In any given year, roughly 40,000 Americans die by
suicide, almost twice as many as are killed by homicide. The military is not
exempt from the problem of suicide. Suicide remains a leading cause of concern
and preventable form of death among Air Force personnel. During the last five
years (2011 - 2015) the Air Force lost between 43- 63 Airmen per year to death
by suicide. This equates to 12.9 to 20.3 suicides for every 100,000 Airmen. The
Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve components have lost an average of 25
Airmen per year. Additionally, the Air Force has lost an average of 18 civilian
employees to death by suicide over the last five years. Within the Air Force,
the most common stressors experienced by those who die by suicide are
relationship problems, legal problems, mental health problems, financial
hardship and work problems. Air Force data shows that while all age, rank,
gender and ethnic groups are represented suicide is most common amongst young,
junior enlisted Caucasian males. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.40. Effect on the
Military.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal6">When suicides occur in the Air Force, they may result in a
number of serious consequences, which include: </p>

<p class="msonormal87">18.40.1. First and foremost, a preventable loss of human
life. </p>

<p class="msonormal88">18.40.2. Second, the grief and loss to the deceased’s
family, friends, co-workers, and military community. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">18.40.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Third,
a direct impact on mission capability through loss of the deceased’s skills,
experience, and productivity. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.41. Dynamics of
Suicide. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal26">18.41.1. The reasons for considering suicide will vary
from person to person. All people experience stressors (i.e., challenges or
problems) and distress (i.e., the negative feelings associated with stressors).
Research tends to identify that risk for suicide is associated with feeling
isolated/not belonging, the belief that the individual is or will become a
burden and an acquired capability both in access to a means to die and
overcoming the fear of dying. Other factors associated with suicide are new or
worsening stressors/distress combined with an inability to problem solve/cope.
The Air Force promotes and supports Airmen who resolve their problems and
challenges in healthy, safe, and constructive ways. To that end, the Air Force
has developed many resources to help Airmen and their families resolve these
problems. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">18.48.2. Airmen must know the importance of
recognizing that anyone can become suicidal, regardless of how well they have
managed military or personal stress previously. If an Airman experiences
stressors or problems that overwhelm their ability to cope, it may result in
feeling distressed, alone, and a burden to others. This may increase
vulnerability and susceptibility to suicide. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.42. Protective
Factors. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">18.42.1. Protective factors are strengths or resources
which the individual possesses or practices which enhance resilience and reduce
distress. Common protective factors include: </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.42.1.1. Sense of belonging. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.42.1.2. Good, healthy support from family, friends, and
fellow Airmen. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.42.1.3. Effective problem solving skills and coping
strategies. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.42.1.4. Individual’s belief that he/she has control
over his/her own life and actions. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.42.1.5. Willingness to seek help early. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.42.1.6. Focus on the future. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.42.1.7. Believe things will get better. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.42.1.8. Lack of access to means to hurt yourself. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.42.1.9. Cultural/religious/spiritual beliefs that
discourage suicide and support self-preservation. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">18.42.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Demographic
factors are personal and unchangeable by the individual. They include aspects
such as gender or age. Common stressors are experiences which may increase
risk. They include experiences such as problems in a relationship or legal
problems. Risk factors are personal characteristics which reduce resilience or
increase susceptibility to illness and suicide. Risk factors include a history
of mental illness or use of substances. Warning signs are sudden and signify a
person is in distress and requires support. Warning signs include sudden
changes such as sleep difficulties or sudden discipline problems (See Figure
18.5.).<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.43. Common
Problems. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">18.43.1. <b class="calibre1">Legal
Problems.</b> Being under investigation for a suspected criminal offense is
extremely stressful. Legal problems almost always entail some type of career
impact and can be cause for administrative action by the Air Force. Military
members who face serious legal problems often worry about public disgrace, a
very real threat to their careers, their freedom, or their ability to find work
if separated from the Air Force. While criminal charges carry realistic
consequences, some individuals may begin thinking of the worst possible outcome
whether realistic or not. This increased stress (real or perceived) is why they
need more support from their command, unit, and Air Force community regardless
of the crime for which they have been investigated/charged/convicted.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal26">18.43.2. <b class="calibre1">Financial
Problems. </b>Financial problems can be a stressor and a cause of distress.
Alert commanders often recognize this as symptomatic of a possible broader
pattern of problems or poor decision-making. Financial problems can also be a
symptom of other problems such as gambling or substance misuse/addiction.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal92">18.43.3.<b class="calibre1">
Relationship Problems. </b>Relationship problems are the most common stressor
type among Air Force members who have died by suicide. An abrupt loss, like a
break up in a romantic relationship is a frequently seen stressor. A healthy,
happy and supportive relationship can be an important protective factor against
many other kinds of stress. When relationships are troubled they may add to
personal stress/distress and/or make other stressors more challenging to
manage. </p>

<p class="msonormal92">18.43.4.<b class="calibre1">
Work and Administrative Problems. </b>Work and administrative problems (e.g.,
failure to complete tasks, poor performance or showing up to work late) have
been noted in many Air Force suicides. These work related stressors may be a
sign of other problems (e.g., alcohol or relationship problems) and/or they may
influence or increase feelings of hopelessness and isolation. Feelings of
hopelessness and isolation increase vulnerability and susceptibility to
suicide. An Airman facing administrative problems like fitness testing failures
may feel his career and future are at risk. Airmen must be able to identify and
understand the seriousness of workplace or administrative problems. Front line
leaders and fellow Airmen should understand the challenges that an Airman may
be experiencing and act to provide support. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">18.43.5.<b class="calibre1">
Mental Health Problems. </b>Studies in non-military populations have tended to
show that up to 90% of individuals dying from suicide have evidence of past
mental health problems. This has led to the assumption that mental health
problems lead to suicide. While many individuals who die by suicide have a
mental health history the majority of individuals with a mental health history
will not attempt or die by suicide. Mental health problems are common among
Airmen who die by suicide. Despite the difficulty to fully quantify mental
health problems among Airmen who die by suicide, since Airmen may avoid seeking
mental health care and/or may under-report their symptoms. Most mental health
problems treated in the Air Force are not severe and many mental health visits
are related to difficulties with life stresses rather than a serious mental
illness. However, individuals with significant mental illness are at increased
risk of suicide. Therefore, Airmen with symptoms of a mental illness must
understand the importance of seeking help early and complying with their
treatment plans. Effective treatments for mental illness are available and can
reduce risk of suicide.<span class="calibre6">   </span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.44. Facts about Air
Force Suicides. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal39">18.44.1.<b class="calibre1">
Planned versus Unplanned. </b>Suicides may be unplanned (impulsive) or planned.
In unplanned suicides, there may be little or no warning. These may be very
difficult to predict or prevent and can be associated with excessive use of
alcohol or other substances. In planned suicides, an individual may take the
time to plan out the aspects of their death, like updating a will or checking
on life insurance. While these are normal activities for most adults to
undertake, a pattern of behavior in an Airman that indicates he is “putting his
affairs in order” may indicate consideration of suicide. There are often some
indicators in either planned or unplanned suicides that can be detected. See
the list of risk factors to identify potential changes.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">18.44.2. <b class="calibre1">Communication
of Intent. </b>Not every Airman who dies by suicide will communicate their
intention to end their life. Some may make suicidal statements (e.g., stating
that others would be better off without them), or send texts, use voicemails,
social media posts or leave a note. Sometimes suicidal individuals talk about
themes of death and suicide, without referring to themselves. In other cases,
the deceased may not communicate their intent at all. The increase in the use
of electronic communications presents another medium for people to communicate
suicidal thoughts or intentions as well as new opportunities for alert Airmen
to intervene. Any suicidal remark should be taken very seriously and followed
up on. Some people are reluctant to ask a person whether they are having
thoughts of suicide because of the fear that they will give someone the idea.
Substantial research indicates that this is not the case. The opposite is true:
asking a person if they are having thoughts of suicide may prevent a suicide by
getting the person the care they need. </p>

<p class="msonormal26">18.44.3.<b class="calibre1"> Time of
Year versus Unpredictable Variability.</b> Statistically, suicide is a rare
occurrence. Because of the infrequent, suicide rates in small populations (e.g.
a major command) vary quite randomly. This often leads people to try to find
factors like time of year to explain rises and dips in rate. One such myth is
that suicide is more common during the holidays when people may feel more alone
and isolated. This is not true. Personal factors like the ones described above
are much more important. Vigilance must be maintained year round. </p>

<p class="msonormal27">18.44.4.<b class="calibre1">
Changes in Behavior versus no Change in Behavior. </b>A common myth is that
once an Airman has made the decision to die by suicide, they may appear calm,
as if all their problems have been resolved. This may be true for some, but not
all. Airmen need to be observant for any sudden changes in behavior or attitude
in their fellow Airman. These changes should be attended to in a supportive
manner to ensure the individual is not considering suicide. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.45. Self-injurious
Behavior and Suicide Attempts. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal93">Self-injurious behavior (i.e., cutting, burning) is
any behavior that intentionally causes harm to the individual regardless of the
severity of the injury. A suicide attempt is any behavior whose intent is to
end the individual’s life, regardless of the outcome. Any self-injury or
suicide attempt should be treated as serious as the severity of injury is not
an accurate indicator of the person’s potential risk or intent. These injuries
warrant immediate medical and command attention and should be addressed and
reported without delay. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.46. Every Airman’s
Responsibilities. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal94">In
the Air Force, each Airman has the responsibility to identify and support other
Airmen (Regular Air Force, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, Civilians and
Family Members) in times of need. Each Airman must be aware of the following: </p>

<p class="msonormal27">(1) Command is available and trained to provide
support to Airmen in need, or those attempting to support their Airmen; (2) The
Air Force established numerous resources aimed at resolving problems and
stressors. Airmen can access these resources through chaplains, medical
services or command leadership; (3) Airman can access counseling through
Military One Source (1-800-342-9647) as well as Military Family Life
Counselors; and (4) National resources like the Military Crisis line
(1-800-273-8233, Press 1). Early identification combined with proactive problem
solving enhances careers. Early intervention increases the probability of
success, and is most likely to save a life; similarly, this helps maintain the
balance promoted through the four domains of Comprehensive Airmen Fitness
(Social, Mental, Physical and Spiritual). There are a number of identifiable
risk factors and warning signs. These may include: (1) multiple stressors or an
intense stressor, sudden mood or behavior changes; (2) giving away personal
effects; and (3) making statements about suicide/suggesting it would be better
if the individual were not alive. Safety is increased when an at-risk Airman
has limited access to means of self-harm (e.g., firearms or potentially
dangerous medications). Command and Legal should be part of this process. Any
sudden purchase of lethal means can be a very significant warning sign that
should be questioned and reported. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">18.46.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>The
people most likely to spot a person at risk for suicide are the ones who
interact with that person on a daily basis (e.g., friends, coworkers or
immediate supervisors). These individuals are best positioned to notice changes
in an atrisk Airman’s behavior, mood, and performance. Engage with that person,
find out what caused the observed changes, assist in choosing resources to
resolve stressors, and communicate concerns with the chain of command as
appropriate. </p>

<p class="msonormal26">18.46.2. Know your resources and encourage appropriate
help-seeking from installation and other support agencies to resolve the
challenges. Challenges and stressors are a normal part of each person’s life.
You are encouraged to engage with fellow Airman and know how they generally
look and behave. When you notice there is a problem, assist your fellow Airman
in finding help to resolve the challenge early. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.47. Military
Leadership Role in Preventing Suicide: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">18.47.1. While suicide prevention is the ultimate
responsibility of every Airman, the Air Force has identified that leadership
support and action across the levels of command are critical to the goal of
reducing suicide in the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">18.47.2. The Air Force Suicide Prevention program
is based on leadership action. Leaders at all levels are responsible for
implementing this program. Successful risk identification rests with the
Airman’s most immediate associates and his or her first-line supervisors who
see and interact with them on a daily basis and are in a position to see any
changes in behavior or performance that may signal a problem. Open
communication between Airmen and their supervisors, especially in an
environment where there is genuine concern for everyone’s well-being, is
vitally important. </p>

<p class="msonormal92">18.47.3. Frontline supervisors have tremendous and
complex responsibilities in our high ops tempo Air Force, executing the mission
and taking care of their subordinates. Effective training and strong leadership
can enhance the support that an Airman will receive. Some factors that can
challenge effective supervision are: (1) tunnel vision on the mission to the
exclusion of subordinate needs; (2) not being engaged with their Airmen; (3)
difficulty recognizing risk factors and warning signs; (4) lack of knowledge of
Air Force supported resources and the true impact of seeking help on an Air
Force career; and (5) inappropriately “protecting” the Airman from the
consequences of their actions or failing to take proper action. Some examples
of inappropriate supervisor actions are supervisors telling subordinates to
avoid seeking mental health assistance as this will hurt their career, helping
subordinates hide alcohol and drug misuse problems, promoting the avoidance of
installation helping services and possible safe and constructive resolution of
problems. The majority of the time, seeking help appropriately does not have
long-term negative career impact. In fact, seeking help can improve performance
and enable people to better solve problems. Supervisors should engage in
problems early to ensure subordinates get the help they need to maintain peak
performance. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">18.47.4. When risk is identified, appropriate
professional resources can be obtained and applied to the problem. The Air
Force has invested in the development of outstanding helping resources whose
purpose is to support individuals in distress, leaders in enhancing safety,
promoting balance in the four domains of Comprehensive Airmen Fitness and
preventing suicide. Appropriate intervention will vary depending on the nature
of the problem and degree of risk. Sometimes situations require services from
multiple support agencies (e.g., Mental Health, Airman &amp; Family Readiness
and Chaplains, etc.). The Airman’s Guide for Assisting Personnel in Distress
provides resources to help supervisors and Airmen guide personnel to
appropriate helping agencies and is available at: <a href="http://www.airforcemedicine.af.mil/airmansguide/index.asp" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre36">airforcemedicine.af.mil/airmansguide</span></a><a href="http://www.airforcemedicine.af.mil/airmansguide/index.asp" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre39">.</span></a> </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.48. Actions to
Mitigate Suicide Risk. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal38">While not every suicide can be prevented, definite
steps can be taken by Air Force personnel to reduce risk in Air Force
populations. The following actions can be taken to support Airmen in resolving
life’s challenges and reducing the number of suicides: (1) Knowing your
co-workers; their usual mood and behaviors, and how they are functioning; (2)
Being able to recognize early signs of risk, stress and distress; (3) Engaging
with Airmen to determine what may be stressful or problematic; (4) Assisting
Airmen with choosing the most appropriate resource to help resolve the problem;
and (5) Following up with Airmen to ensure the stressors are resolving and new
ones are not taking their place. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.49. Psychological
Services. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal26">Mental Health Services are designed to be a force
multiplier in the Air Force. Seeking care for a mental health problem is a sign
of strength and increases the likelihood of recovery while reducing risk for suicide.
More than 12% of Air Force personnel voluntarily seek mental health services
each year. </p>

<p class="msonormal38">18.49.1. At the installation level, mental health
clinic staff members typically perform a risk assessment on all individuals who
come in for services as well as screen for suicide at follow up appointments.
The services and treatment provided at mental health clinics play an important
role in suicide prevention, but the healthcare system does not own the problem
and can only act if aware of the problem. This means individuals at risk must
either seek help themselves or be brought into the healthcare system by others.
Suicide prevention is the responsibility of the entire Air Force community. </p>

<p class="msonormal39">18.49.2. A common fear is that seeking care at the
mental health clinic will have negative impact on the person’s career. A 2006
study (Rowan, A.B. &amp; Campise R. L., 2006) reviewing more than 1,000
self-referred mental health cases found that in 89 percent of cases there was
no contact at all between the mental health clinic and the patient’s unit. In
97% of cases there was no negative impact on career. Confidentiality is
governed by AFI 44-172 <i class="calibre2">Mental Health.</i>
</p>

<p class="msonormal38">18.49.3. Mental health providers are required by
DoDI 6490.08, <i class="calibre2">Command Notification
Requirements to Dispel Stigma in Providing Mental Health Care to Service
Members,</i><span class="calibre35"> </span>to disclose safety (for example, suicidal or violent thoughts)
and fitness for duty issues to commanders, but all other information is
private. For more information on the limitations of confidentiality see DoDI
6490.08. Willingness to seek help when needed is a sign of good judgment and
strength. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">18.49.4. In an effort to promote help-seeking by
Airmen who are experiencing legal or administrative problems, the Air Force
instituted the Limited Privilege Suicide Prevention Program in accordance with
AFI 44-172<i class="calibre2">. </i>This program allows
Airmen who are under investigation to receive mental health care without risk
of further incriminating themselves. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.50. Air Force
Suicide Prevention Program: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">The Air Force Suicide Prevention Program is an evidence
based approach which requires that all personnel take an active role in
reducing suicide.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal95">18.50.1.<b class="calibre1"> Suicide
Prevention Program’s History.</b> In May 1996, General Thomas S. Moorman, Air
Force Vice- </p>

<p class="msonormal27">Commander, commissioned an integrated product team
composed of all functional areas of the Air Force. He requested General Charles
H. Roadman (Air Force Surgeon General) chair the 75-member committee and
develop suicide prevention strategies. The suicide prevention integrated
product team quickly realized suicide was not a medical problem, but instead
was a community problem. To establish an effective program, they designed a
line program owned by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force with the Air Force
Surgeon General as the office of primary responsibility. The program was
founded upon the concept that decreasing suicides required a community/Public
Health approach in which prevention and assistance were offered long before
someone became suicidal.<span class="calibre6">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal18">18.50.2. <b class="calibre1">Air
Force Suicide Prevention Summit</b>. In 2015, in response to a concern about
rising suicide rates, the Air Force convened a Suicide Prevention Summit,
bringing together subject matter experts from DoD, the Military Services,
federal agencies including the National Institute for Mental Health and Centers
for Disease Control and academic researchers and theorists, to address the
issue of suicide in the Air Force and move the program forward. Based on the
recommendations of the Summit, six interconnected Suicide Prevention Lines of
Effort were identified and six corresponding working groups were formed under
oversight of the Air Force Integrated Delivery System and Community Action
information Board. These Lines of Effort’s included: (1) Integrate Prevention;
(2) Strengthen Airman Culture; (3) Leverage Strength-Based Communication; (4)
Enhance Civilian Support Services; (5) Targeted Resilience Outreach; and (6)
Improve Medical Care of At-risk Airmen. The 11 elements were retained as the
core of the program while a wide range of initiatives were established and
executed under the Lines of Effort framework to enhance the effectiveness of
suicide prevention.<span class="calibre6">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal5">18.50.3.<b class="calibre1"> Air
Force Suicide Prevention Program Elements.</b> In order to combat suicide, the
suicide prevention integrated product team developed and implemented 11
overlapping initiatives or elements, as published in AFI 90-505, <i class="calibre2">Suicide Prevention Program. </i>These 11
initiatives are designed to foster an Airman culture under commander-led action
groups which can be grouped into three broad categories: </p>

<p class="msonormal43">18.50.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Leadership
and Community.</b> Leadership Involvement, Unit-based Preventive Services,
Airman Culture, Suicide Event Tracking and Analysis, Post Suicide Response
(Postvention), Integrated Delivery System, Community Action Information Board
and Commanders Consultation Assessment Tool. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.50.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Education.</b>
Addressing Suicide Prevention through Professional Military Education,
Guidelines for Commanders: Use of Mental Health Services. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">18.50.3.3. <b class="calibre1">Protections
for those under Investigation.</b> The Investigative Interview Policy and
Limited Privilege Suicide Prevention Program. The Investigate Interview policy
directs that following any investigative interview, the Air Force investigators
(e.g., Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Inspector General, Security
Forces, and Equal Employment Opportunity) must hand-off the accused directly to
the member’s commander, or first sergeant through person-to-person documented
contact.<span class="calibre35"> </span>Limited Privilege Suicide Prevention Program<span class="calibre35"> </span>is
available to those who are under investigation or have been formally charged
with a crime. This protection allows individuals at risk of suicide to access
mental health services with confidentiality of what is discussed during that
time that the individual is deemed to be at risk. </p>

<p class="msonormal96"><b class="calibre1">18.51. Intervention
Model. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal61">Suicide prevention is everyone’s responsibility.
For effective suicide prevention, we need to create a culture that encourages
early help-seeking behavior and develop a community that provides assistance
long before someone becomes suicidal. The model listed below was developed to
assist Airmen in intervening when an Airman is experiencing stress, distress
and challenges. </p>

<p class="msonormal97"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal21"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.51.1. <b class="calibre1">The Ask,
Care, and Escort (ACE) Model. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal98">To facilitate personal engagement in suicide prevention,
the Air Force has developed the acronym, ACE, to help people remember the key
steps. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">18.51.1.1. <b class="calibre1">Ask.
</b>When you see or hear any of the warning signs discussed in this section, or
are aware of risk factors in someone’s life, ask questions to learn more about
the person’s problems or concerns. If you have any concerns about someone’s
safety, calmly but directly ask the question, “Are you thinking of
killing/hurting yourself?” Asking about suicide gives people permission to talk
about a subject that may otherwise be difficult to bring up and lets the Airman
know you are ready to discuss what they are experiencing. Do not promise to
keep thoughts of suicide a secret. Airmen need to remember the importance of
sharing these concerns with command and professionals who can help the person. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">18.51.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Care.
S</b>howing care and concern for those at risk is important. Simply taking the
time to ask about problems, and asking specifically about suicide shows caring
and concern. If someone acknowledges thoughts of suicide, listen to them and
allow them to share what is troubling them. Avoid making judgmental statements,
such as “you wouldn’t do something so stupid” or immediately trying to solve
their problem or talk them out of suicide. If they have shared thoughts of
suicide with you, accept that they are in distress, listen to their concerns,
and begin the process of getting them help. You should also identify if they
have a plan for suicide, what the plan is, and attempt to remove anything that
might be used for self-harm, such as weapons or medications. First, understand
there are many potential means for self-harm and recommend you take reasonable
steps to secure the potential means of suicide while not putting yourself in
harm’s way. If you are not able to secure the potential means of selfharm, or
you have significant concern about the individual’s safety, then command and
emergency services need to be contacted. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">18.51.1.3. <b class="calibre1">Escort.
</b>After asking about suicide and showing concern, the final step is to escort
the person to command, or a professional support agency that can provide
appropriate assistance. Do not leave him or her alone, or send the person alone
to a chaplain or mental health clinic as he or she may change his or her mind
on the way. At most bases, chaplains and mental health professionals are on
call through the command post, and evaluations can be conducted in local
emergency rooms if on-base services are not accessible. If an Airman reveals
that he or she is thinking about suicide, this is a life or death emergency and
command must be contacted. If a distressed Airman will not agree to go with
you, you should contact your chain of command or emergency services for help to
ensure the person’s safety. </p>

<p class="msonormal99">18.51.2. Understanding the appropriate steps to
suicide risk prevention and the available Air Force approved resources can aid
in saving the career and life of a fellow Airman. Engage the Airman to
understand the problem. Utilize leadership to support safety and good
decision-making. In non-crisis situations utilize resources such as chaplain
services, Military Family Life Counselors or Military One Source. If an Airman
is in crisis utilize emergency services including Air Force, local civilian or
national resources, 911, emergency room, mental health clinic or Military
Crisis Line (1-800-273-8255) to provide professional support to an Airman in
distress. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 18H—Posttraumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD) </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.52. Posttraumatic
Stress Disorder Components. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">Understanding the difference between operational
stress and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is important. Most individuals
who experience a traumatic event in an operational environment will have some
reaction and some signs of “stress” like problems with sleep or troublesome
memories; however, the majority of individuals exposed to a traumatic event
will not develop PTSD. PTSD is a complex mental health diagnosis made by
trained professionals for individuals meeting specific diagnostic criteria.
Prolonged or repeated exposures to stressful or traumatic events increase the
chance of stress reactions, and if over looked or untreated can lead to mental
health symptoms to include recurrent and unwanted thoughts, images and dreams,
exaggerated startle response, and avoidance of situations or activities that
remind the individual of aspects of the traumatic event. PTSD also causes
persistent mood symptoms, including feelings of depression, foreshortened sense
of the future, and an inability to express the full range of emotions. This
latter symptom is often noticed by friends and family members who are more
likely to notice a mood or behavioral change in the individual with PTSD. Since
the dawn of time, people have experienced traumatic events and many have the skills
and resources to deal with them. For this reason most stress reactions resolve
on their own or with minimal assistance, especially when identified early.
Therefore, the benefit to the individual, unit and mission is to recognize and
respond to stressors and stress-related symptoms proactively when they are
present in the unit or individual. However, do not assume that simply because
someone has been exposed to trauma, they will inevitably develop PTSD. If
symptoms from a traumatic event emerge, they usually emerge within the first 30
days of the trauma and for someone to develop delayed onset PTSD in the absence
of any initial symptoms is unusual. Some of the symptoms of PTSD you might
notice in yourself or your wingmen are listed below. Depending on many factors,
like the severity and number of exposures, for a small subset of individuals,
stress reactions do not resolve on their own, and symptoms of PTSD may develop.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual5 defines PTSD by eight criteria: (1)
stressor (there must be a traumatic incident the person was exposed to); (2)
intrusive symptoms (the person persistently re-experiences the event); (3)
avoidance (the person attempts to avoid reminders of the event); (4) negative
alterations in cognitions (thoughts) and mood; (5) alterations in arousal and
reactivity (like irritability, easy startle and sleep difficulties); (6)
duration (persistence of symptoms greater than one month); (7) functional
significance (impact to functional areas (e.g., social, occupational)); and (8)
exclusion (disturbance not due to medication, substance use or other illness).
As with most mental health diagnoses, other conditions must first be ruled-out
before a diagnosis of PTSD can be made. This includes the effects of
medication, alcohol or a co-existing medical condition that shares some of the
symptoms of PTSD.<span class="calibre6">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.53. PTSD Incidence.
</b></p>

<p class="msonormal39">New rates of diagnosed PTSD continue to remain
relatively low (under 1%) among total force Airmen, but differ by gender and
career group. Women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with PTSD as men, and
specific career fields show elevated rates of PTSD, including special
investigators, medical, and support personnel. Deployment is a risk factor for
PTSD because deployment increases the likelihood of exposure to trauma.
However, an important note is that most people who develop PTSD experience a
non-combat trauma such as interpersonal violence which can occur in a number of
different environments. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.54. Prevention. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">The prevention of PTSD occurs by fostering
resilient coping responses to stress. The more psychologically capable the
individual is to withstand a stressful situation, the less likely that
individual is to develop PTSD. An internal locus of control, the belief that
and commitment to life values, and a supportive peer network are all factors
that bolster the stress response and enable Airmen to go through trauma without
negative consequences. Further, the ability to recognize stress reactions and
intervene when they are present is important in the prevention of PTSD and
other mental health issues. This is based on the theory that preparation for trauma
helps to “insulate” the individual and gain a sense of control or mastery over
the environment. Deploying Airman receive just in time training on stress
reactions, psychological first aid, and referral resources through online
Pre-Deployment mental health training (in Advanced Distributed Learning
Service). Additionally, post deployment training (currently provided by
installation mental health staff) focuses on the reintegration back into home
life and work after a deployment and how to recognize stress reactions and
symptoms that can remain or emerge following a deployment where there have been
potentially traumatic experiences. Critical to the prevention of PTSD is for
leaders to clearly communicate mission details and expectations to the extent
possible so that deploying Airmen can anticipate their deployment experiences
and practice adaptive coping responses prior to exposure to trauma. Preparation
also helps Airman evaluate the possible difficulties they may experience during
deployment and develop a plan for managing those difficulties before they
occur.<span class="calibre6">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.54.1.<b class="calibre1"> Risk and
Protective Factors. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal43">18.54.1.1. There are many factors that can make an
individual more vulnerable to negative effects of traumatic experiences and to
eventually develop PTSD. Some of these include ongoing life stresses, lack of
social support, history of a psychiatric disorder/or family history of one, and
past stresses like prior combat exposure, and even childhood history of abuse.
Each individual has different personal strengths and resilience skills that
help him or her deal with traumatic experiences. Therefore, each unit is a sum
of these strengths and each deployed unit should capitalize on these strengths.
Understanding your personal strengths and vulnerabilities and those of the
others in your unit allows you to intervene early after a traumatic event and
seek out the support needed for resolving stress reactions. Remember, risk
factors or even exposure to horrific events do not equal a diagnosis of PTSD. </p>

<p class="msonormal43">18.54.1.2. Effective unit leadership is a critical
factor in preventing PTSD. A cohesive unit with solid leadership, clear
operational goals, and frequent communication can reduce risk. Leadership which
stresses and Airmen who practice good self-care (getting regular and adequate
sleep, eating a balanced diet, and having adequate time for rest and
relaxation) along with the use of positive stress management skills can help
reduce operational stress and decrease the risk of PTSD. Informed leaders can
actively impact their units to reduce the risk of PTSD and other related
problems to their Airmen by ensuring they are engaged and working as a team. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.54.2. <b class="calibre1">Operational
Stress Reactions. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">Operational stress reactions can be experienced by
both individuals exposed to a traumatic event or those individuals/units with a
high operational tempo where the requirements of battle have kept them from
having adequate downtime. Stress reactions may be evident in different forms
and may range from mild to severe. Below are some of the reactions to be aware
of to ensure early intervention. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.54.2.1. Physical signs like rapid breathing or
shortness of breath, feeling dizzy, headaches, feeling nauseated, profuse
sweating or sweaty palms, and rapid heart rate. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.54.2.2. Mental signs like sleep disturbance, poor
attention and concentration, poor problem solving, confusion, hyper-vigilance,
and nightmares. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.54.2.3. Emotional signs like irritability and blaming
others, fear or anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, feeling guilt, denial, agitation,
and feelings of sadness (depressed mood). </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.54.2.4. Behavioral signs like withdrawal, change in
communication, increased alcohol consumption, change in appetite, emotional
outbursts, jumpiness or being easily startled, and suspiciousness. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.54.3. <b class="calibre1">Psychological
First Aid. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal100">Psychological first aid is designed to reduce the initial
distress caused by a traumatic event and can be used for ongoing operational
stress where individuals may exhibit stress reactions. Psychological first aid
supports individuals with stress reactions by teaching adaptive coping and
recovery skills that can easily be implemented. </p>

<p class="msonormal101">For individuals whose stress reactions aren’t
resolving in a short period of time, additional support from Mental Health or
the Combat &amp; Operational Stress Control unit should be encouraged. Tenets
of psychological first aid include the following: </p>

<p class="msonormal102">18.54.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Safety.</b>
Provide a physically and emotionally safe place (as the operational environment
allows) for individuals to recuperate emotionally following a traumatic event.
This may be as simple as designating a tent/shelter away from the incident with
food, water and a place to relax. </p>

<p class="msonormal103">18.54.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Needs.</b>
Learn what the Airmen’s needs and concerns are by listening to them with
compassion and responding with a calm voice. Are they worried about someone? Do
they want to make a phone call? </p>

<p class="msonormal103">18.54.3.3. <b class="calibre1">Availability.</b>
Make yourself available. For example, offer to go to the gym, dining facility,
play games, morale tent, or just be there to talk/listen. </p>

<p class="msonormal104">18.54.3.4. <b class="calibre1">Support.</b>
Encourage Airmen to stay connected with peers and social support, this maybe in
the deployed setting or at home. </p>

<p class="msonormal103">18.54.3.5. <b class="calibre1">Coping.</b>
Provide basic coping skills that empower others to make decisions for one’s
self and restoration back to ‘normal’ state. Lead by example using self-care
mentioned earlier. </p>

<p class="msonormal103">18.54.3.6. <b class="calibre1">Services.</b>
Finally, link individual with supportive services, if needed. These include
Chaplains, first sergeants, or Mental Health. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.54.4. <b class="calibre1">Pre-Exposure
Preparation.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal9">18.54.4.1. The goal of Pre-Exposure preparation is
to enhance resilience through anticipating and understanding normal responses
to unusual stressors which might include exposure to battle or a mass accident
scene with human casualties. Individuals are better prepared, are calmer and
feel more in control when they have some advance knowledge of what to expect on
scene and what stress reactions are normal and to be expected. Pre-Exposure
preparation focuses on preparing Airmen for a particular mission or incident by
providing relevant (and sometimes graphic) details applicable to the probable
upcoming mission or situation. In preparing Airmen for a mission, PreExposure
preparation training will educate the Airman on three key steps to support
successful performance under stress by: (1) Being aware of the individual’s
functioning and changes in functioning (such as changes in their behavior,
sleep, or mood); (2) Identifying and practicing positive stress management
behaviors (such as getting proper sleep, nutrition, and exercise); and (3)
Avoiding unhelpful coping behaviors (such as excessive alcohol usage, poor
sleep or eating practices, etc). Pre-Exposure preparation should be tailored to
the unit and specific mission in order to be relevant and effective. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">18.54.4.2. Units that have a moderate or higher chance of
exposure to traumatic events as part of their duties can enhance their
psychological resilience and risk of operational stress with the following
preparation principles:<span class="calibre6">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal74">18.54.4.2.1.<b class="calibre1">
Engage in Realistic Training. </b>Get Airmen ready for the tasks they will
perform in the operational environment.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Train
using simulated or actual exposure to realistic events, such as body handling,
survival training, and mock captivity training, as appropriate for the unit’s
mission. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">18.54.4.2.2.<b class="calibre1">
Strengthen Perceived Ability to Cope. </b>Feeling competent to do one’s job in
an operational environment is critical.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Discuss
reasons for realistic training. Enhance the individual’s sense of competency by
training to the point until the Airmen feels competent and has gained a sense
of mastery. If possible, include the teaching of coping skills during operational
training in order to increase the likelihood that the Airmen will use those
skills when needed. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.55. Treatment. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal105">Today, there are treatments available for PTSD that
have been demonstrated through rigorous scientific research to be high
effective. These are referred to as Evidence-Based Treatments. The Air Force
has supported training in two EvidenceBased Treatments by requiring training in
one or more Evidence-Based Treatments during mental health residency programs
in psychiatry, psychology, and social work. Direct accession providers receive
training in Evidence-Based Treatments during their first assignment through a
collaborative arrangement with the Center for Deployment Psychology. The two
Evidence-Based Treatments that are taught to all mental health providers in the
United States Air Force are: (a) Cognitive Processing Therapy; and (b)
Prolonged Exposure. These are among the Evidence-Based Treatments that have
been recommended as first-line treatment of PTSD by the Veterans
Affairs/Department of Defense Clinical Practice Guidelines based on a detailed
review of the scientific literature. Typical treatment protocols include 10-12,
weekly sessions with a trained provider in a supportive, therapeutic
environment. Most research indicates that Evidence-Based Treatments reduces
PTSD symptoms by approximately 50% and that this improvement is sustained over
several months to years. In many cases, Airmen diagnosed with PTSD and treated
with Evidence-Based Treatments will “lose” the PTSD diagnosis and will notice
that symptoms either disappear entirely, or are sub-threshold and do not
interfere with quality of life. If properly treated, the majority of Airmen
diagnosed with PTSD never require a medical board. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 18I—Stress Management </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.56. Stress Defined.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal71">18.56.1. At some point in your life, you have
probably experienced stress. Long work days, increased deployments, and
financial issues are just a few of the things that can make you feel stressed.
The frequency of stress and the significant negative effect stress can have on
people and organizations make this a major concern of enlisted leaders at all
levels. The importance at the organizational level is because stress can
negatively affect performance, organizational effectiveness, and mission
accomplishment. On a personal level, experiencing stress over an extended
period of time can lead to health problems and affect your overall quality of
life. Therefore, the importance is to personally and professionally recognize
stress and to learn how to manage stress effectively. </p>

<p class="msonormal26">18.56.2. Stress is a dynamic concept that dates back to
earlier this century. According to Jerrold S. Greenberg in his book <i class="calibre2">Comprehensive Stress Management</i>, the
concept of stress is based on the research of two individuals named Walter
Cannon and Hans Selye. Cannon, a physiologist at Harvard Medical School, was
the first person to describe the body’s reaction to stress. He identified this
reaction as a response to a perceived threat that prepared the body for flight
or fight. Later research conducted by Selye, an endocrinologist widely regarded
as the father of stress research, concluded that the body’s reaction to stress
was the same regardless of whether the source was good or bad, positive or
negative. He also provided us with a useful definition of stress. According to
Selye, stress can be defined as “the nonspecific response of the body to any demand
for change.” The demand in Selye’s definition is commonly called a stressor. </p>

<p class="msonormal106">18.56.3. A stressor can be more
accurately defined as any factor (demand) that has the potential to cause
stress. This factor can be positive, such as getting promoted, or negative,
such as getting fired. The causes of stress is from either positive or negative
factors. Selye labeled the stress experienced from positive factors eustress.
Eustress results from exhilarating experiences and is the stress of winning and
achieving. He labeled the stress experienced from negative factors distress. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">Distress includes the stress of losing, failing,
overworking, and not coping effectively. When you start to feel “stressed out,”
distress is usually the type of stress you are feeling. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">18.56.4. We are in daily contact with many types of
stressors. For the most part, we can categorize them into two major areas:
organizational stressors and extra-organizational stressors. </p>

<p class="msonormal68">18.56.4.1. Organizational stressors are the type of
factors experienced in the work environment. For Airmen today, that could range
from short-notice deployments to hazardous working conditions. Imagine how you
would feel if your commander informed you that you would deploy in a week, or
how you might feel if your work environment was bombarded with loud noises all
day. If these types of situations regularly happen to you and you have not
developed effective ways to cope with them, you could experience stress. </p>

<p class="msonormal74">18.56.4.2. Extra-organizational stressors are the
type of factors experienced outside the work environment. Three major
extra-organizational stressors are family, marital, and financial issues.
Family and marital issues can run the gamut from minor illness to conflicting
roles in the family to a death in the family. Similarly, financial problems can
run from the minor to the catastrophic. These types of stressors are important
because while they usually occur outside of the duty section, if not properly
managed, they can affect performance at work. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">18.56.5. How do you know if you are stressed?
Stress reactions appear in four different categories: cognitive, emotional,
behavioral, and physical. The key to recognizing stress is to know understand
what is normal for you so that you can recognize when something has changed.
The combined presence of symptoms determines the degree of the problem. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">Indicators (Figure 18.6) may be isolated reactions or
combinations among the four categories. Finally, the duration, frequency, and
intensity of the symptoms could make dealing with stress difficult. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">18.56.6. Being able to recognize the symptoms of
stress is important, not only for yourself, but for your Airmen, as well. The
earlier you identify what stress does to your body and state of mind, the
earlier you can employ stress reduction techniques. </p>

<p class="msonormal26">18.56.7. Stress management programs and methods vary, but
they all tend to have common goals. Individual stress management methods aim at
strengthening your ability to manage stressors and the stress response.
Organizational stress management methods aim more at altering potential
stressors themselves. Because organizational and extra-organizational stressors
are interrelated and influence each other, attention to both stress management
methods is vitally important. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.57.</b> <b class="calibre1">Individual Stress Management Methods:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.57.1. <b class="calibre1">Planning.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal7">You can reduce stress by identifying potential
stressors before they cause problems. Once you identify stressors, you can
develop strategies to avoid their effects while achieving your goals. For
example, if you are stressed by crowds and long lines, don’t plan to visit the
commissary on or just after payday. If you get extremely upset when you are
recalled in the middle of the night, having the latest recall roster and
procedures readily available at all times may help reduce the amount of stress
you feel. While planning can’t prevent stress that occurs as an event is
happening, planning is extremely valuable in preventing stress before a
stressor occurs. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.57.2. <b class="calibre1">Time
Management.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal73">Not having enough time to complete a task can be a
significant stressor for some people. If time management is an issue for you,
you can reduce stress by using effective time management skills and tools, like
developing a task list and prioritizing tasks. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.57.3. <b class="calibre1">Overload
Avoidance.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal108">For most people to eliminate, or at least reduce,
the effects of overload-related stressors is relatively simple. For a start,
identify and avoid busy work, delegate or empower others when possible, learn
to say no, and attempt to negotiate unreasonable deadlines. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.57.4. <b class="calibre1">Relaxation. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal101">Relaxation can help you manage stress and stay
alert, energetic, and productive. When you relax, you reduce mind and body
tension. By incorporating relaxation skills into your daily routines, you can
train your body to respond differently to stress. Relaxation techniques, such
as meditation, reading, and listening to music, can improve your heart rate,
regulate your blood pressure, and decrease your respiratory rate. If you are
experiencing stress in your life, taking the time to relax can reduce the
negative effects of stress on your health. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.57.5. <b class="calibre1">Exercise and
Good Nutrition.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal109">Regular exercise combined with a healthy diet is an
effective stress management technique. Exercise can provide an outlet for
excess energy and tension caused by stress. Eating nutritious foods ensures
your body has the nutrients needed to manage stress, and helps prevent
overeating. Exercising and eating a balanced diet help your body become more
resistant to the negative results of stress, such as high blood pressure, heart
attacks, and frequent illness. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.57.6. <b class="calibre1">Strong Social
Support Networks. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal110">Having a strong social support network such as family,
friends, social clubs, peers etc. can help you manage stress.<span class="calibre6">  </span>Being able to discuss your problems with
people who care about you and your wellbeing can help reduce your stress by
giving you a more positive outlook, suggest solutions to your problems, or just
listen. Just talking about your problems and letting them out can help release
any built-up tension and may make you see the situation or problem more
clearly.<span class="calibre6">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal111"><b class="calibre1">18.58.</b> <b class="calibre1">Organizational Stress
Management Methods.</b> As an Airman or a supervisor, your approach to dealing
with stress can help reduce your and your subordinates’ stress levels. You can
begin by identifying potential stressors in the work environment and developing
strategies to remove or reduce them. Here are a few examples of organizational
stress management methods you can use: </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.58.1. <b class="calibre1">Job Design.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal24">If you identify potential sources of stress
associated with tasks, ask yourself if there is a need for each task and if the
task is feasible. Eliminate the task if not needed. If the task is feasible,
ask yourself how important job design is and prioritize. If your job requires
you and/or your subordinates to work long hours, consider using elements of job
enrichment, like giving adequate time off or periodic breaks to help reduce
potential stress. If within your power restructure the job to better accommodate
individual needs and the abilities of your Airmen to help reduce stress and
enhance productivity. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.58.2. <b class="calibre1">Improving the
Work Environment.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal51">Numerous physical factors within a work environment
can be potential stressors. Some of these stressors cannot be eliminated, but
you may be able to reduce them. Examine such environmental factors as
temperature, noise, light levels, and make necessary improvements. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.58.3.<b class="calibre1"> Improving
Organizational Communication.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">A lack of information can be a significant stressor.
As a supervisor, you should do your best to keep your subordinates informed
about anything that could impact their lives. In addition, you should practice
good communication skills, like active listening, being open minded and
avoiding prejudging, and humility. These skills not only will help reduce
stress, but also promote trust, cooperation, and teamwork within the work
center. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.58.4. <b class="calibre1">Personnel
Selection and Job Placement.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal112">Having the wrong person in a job position can
create a great deal of stress for the individual and others. When possible, you
should carefully match individuals to a position they are qualified for based
on their skills, level of experience, and rank. In the military, this might not
be the easiest thing to do, but you should keep in mind the potential
stress-related benefits of having the right person in the right position. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.58.5. <b class="calibre1">Workplace
Conflict.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal24">Having conflict with co-workers can cause serious
stress within the work center. Look for ways to help resolve any issues you or
subordinates may have with others. Sit down and talk with the person with whom
you are having conflict with, listen to their point of view and understand what
the other person is saying, communicate your point of view in a calm and
professional way, and try to come to an agreement or compromise. If the
conflict can’t be resolved amongst yourselves you may need to have a mediator
to help resolve the issue.<span class="calibre6">   </span></p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.58.6. <b class="calibre1">Substance
Abuse Programs.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal113">Sometimes stress can cause people to resort to
excessive amounts of alcohol and/or drugs which can have a dramatically
negative effect on mission, morale, and readiness. All supervisors are
responsible and accountable for managing substance abusers in accordance with
applicable directives and getting them the help they need. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 18J—Redeployment Support
Process </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.59. Purpose. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal38">The positive and sustained care, control, and
discipline of each Airman is the purpose of the redeployment support process.
The goal is to ensure personnel readiness throughout the air and space
expeditionary force cycle by providing timely support for our military members
and their families. Redeployment support is an ongoing process, not a
homecoming event. The intent is to provide continuous, integrated support from
the area of responsibility to home station and to assist in the transition from
the deployed environment to family life and work site.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.60. Recovery. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">After periods of arduous duty and protracted
periods of deployment, a lengthy respite from the deployment environment has a
beneficial effect on an individual’s psychological and physical status. An
immediate recovery period also provides time for the returning Airman to tend
to personal needs neglected during lengthy periods away from home. Each major
command is responsible for establishing and publishing personnel recovery
(leave, passes, attribution, and retention) policies for returning combat
forces. See AFI 36-3003, <i class="calibre2">Military Leave
Program</i>, for guidance.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.61. Reconstitution.
</b></p>

<p class="msonormal39">Although recovery is important to support returning
forces as they transition back to their normal environment, they also must be
reconstituted for further deployment possibilities, including surge
requirements. This process entails planning that will return units back to full
combat capability in a short time. While there is no one correct rule set for
reconstitution planning, consideration must be given to prioritizing and
restoring levels of consumables expended during the crisis, and recovering lost
training. Every base/unit must assess their own situation based on such
variables as the magnitude, duration, and intensity of a crisis, consumption
rates, and the type of deployment location (fixed versus austere base). See AFI
10401, <i class="calibre2">Air Force Operations Planning and
Execution</i>, for further guidance on reconstitution.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">18.62. Scope. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal71">The Air Force redeployment support process applies
to deployed area of responsibility and home stations. All personnel deployed to
an area of responsibility, to continental United States locations in support of
contingencies, and to remote assignments are included. Key determinants for
participation are lengthy family separation and significant family related
stressors prior to reintegration. Community Action Information Board and
Integrated Delivery System helping agencies complete specified activities to
support redeployed Regular Air Force, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve,
military and civilian personnel, their family members, and units during the air
and space expeditionary force cycle. Readjustment from duty in the area of
responsibility requires structured recovery time and activities for members and
families prior to leave or temporary duty.<b class="calibre1">

<p class="msonormal8">18.64.1. <b class="calibre1">Personnel
Readiness.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">Personnel readiness begins reintegration, and
develops the reception station. Personnel readiness will ensure procedures are
established to account for members returning from deployments. These procedures
will be incorporated into installation reconstitution planning and the
installation deployment plan. Returning units and individuals will in-process
with the installation personnel readiness element within 2 duty days of
redeployment day. The installation personnel readiness element will update the
date of return to home station for all individuals in Deliberate and Crisis
Action Planning and Execution Segments on the date of notification of return
according to AFI 36-3802, <i class="calibre2">Personnel

<p class="msonormal10">Chaplain Corps members support personnel, families,
and base populations during contingencies according to AFI 52-104, <i class="calibre2">Chaplain Service Readiness</i>. At home
station following deployment, chaplain service members provide follow-up
support, reintegration and reunion ministries, and other programs to strengthen
families and enhance individual spiritual health. Post-deployment services at
Air Force Reserve Command wings will be coordinated with the reserve wing
deployment support program point of contact.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal8">18.64.3. <b class="calibre1">Airman and
Family Readiness Center.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal23">18.64.3.1. The Airman and Family Readiness Center provides
mobility and deployment assistance to help single and married Department of
Defense personnel and families meet predeployment, deployment, and post
deployment challenges, according to AFI 36-3009, <i class="calibre2">Airman and Family Readiness Centers</i>. Services help reduce stress
and deal with separation and reintegration, increase individual and family
morale and unit cohesion, and support operational readiness. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">18.64.3.2. Airman and Family Readiness Centers use
electronic media and hard copies to help develop reintegration educational
material and provide materials support to the chaplain and mental health
services in the area of responsibility. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">18.64.3.3. During deployments, Airman and Family
Readiness Center staffs tailor support to commanders, units, and families; work
with local school authorities and teachers to help them understand stressors
unique to children of deployed military; provide a myriad deployment support
programs; and distribute commercial, printed materials addressing deployment.
Upon request, one-on-one counseling is available. The Airman and Family
Readiness Center staff provides support to the parents and siblings of single
Airmen. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">18.64.3.4. Post deployment assistance is linked to
pre-deployment activities, particularly early intervention to educate families,
single members, and units on concerns related to reunion and reintegration. The
Airman and Family Readiness Center staff monitors family coping skills, assists
potential at-risk families, and collaborates with Community Action Information

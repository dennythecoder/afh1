    <p class="msonormal12">8.2.4.3.8. When the flag is suspended across a corridor or lobby in a building with only one main entrance, the flag should be suspended vertically with the union of the flag to the observer’s left upon entering. If the building has more than one main entrance, the flag should be suspended vertically near the center of the corridor or lobby with the union to the north when entrances are to the east and west or to the east when entrances are to the north and south. If there are entrances in more than two directions, the union should be to the east. This includes aircraft hangars.</p><p class="msonormal16">8.2.4.3.9. When three flag staffs are positioned outside a building, there may be two display options. If the flag staffs are in a straight line, then the flags should be of the same height with the U.S. flag to its own right. Use the building looking out to the flags as the point of reference for flag placement when flags are in line. If the flag is positioned on the center staff, then the center staff must be higher than the other two staffs.</p><p class="msonormal12">8.2.4.3.10. On a closed casket, place the flag lengthwise with the union at the head and over the left shoulder of the deceased (Figure 8.11). When a full-couch casket is opened, remove the flag, fold to the triangular shape of a cocked hat, and place in the lid at the head end of the casket and just above the decedent’s left shoulder. When a half-couch casket is opened, fold the flag on the lower half of the casket in the same relative position as when displayed full length on a closed casket. Do not lower the flag into the grave, and do not allow the flag to touch the ground. The interment flag may be given to the next of kin at the conclusion of the interment.</p>

However, the Air Force flag and organizational flags will be dipped as appropriate. Military members will render the military salute as appropriate. At no time will a foreign national flag be dipped.</p><p class="msonormal10">8.2.5.1.

The flag should never be festooned, drawn back, up, or in folds, but always allowed to fall free (for example, the flag should not be used to cover a speaker’s podium, drape the front of a platform, or for other decoration. A proper substitute is bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below).</p><p class="msonormal10">8.2.5.5.

The 13 white stars represent the original 13 colonies. The Air Force yellow numerals under the shield stand for 1947, the year the Department of the Air Force was established. The band encircling the whole design is white edged in Air Force yellow with black lettering reading “Department of the Air Force” on the top and “U.S. of America” on the bottom. Centered on the circular background is the Air Force Coat of Arms, consisting of the crest and shield.</p><p class="msonormal18">8.3.1.1. The crest consists of the eagle, wreath, and cloud form. The American bald eagle symbolizes the U.S. air power, and appears in natural colors. The wreath under the eagle is made up of six alternate folds of metal (white, representing silver) and light blue. This repeats the metal and color used in the shield. The white clouds behind the eagle denote the start of a new sky.</p><p class="msonormal44">8.3.1.2. The shield, directly below the eagle and wreath, is divided horizontally into two parts by a nebular line representing clouds. The top part bears an Air Force yellow thunderbolt with flames in natural color that shows striking power through the use of aerospace. The thunderbolt consists of an Air Force yellow vertical twist with three natural color flames on each end crossing a pair of horizontal wings with eight lightning bolts. The background of the top part is light blue representing the sky. The lower part is white representing metal silver.</p><p class="msonormal8">8.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> Authorized and Unauthorized Uses of the Seal and Coat of Arms.<span class="calibre2"></span></b></p><p class="msonormal52">Title 18, United States Code, Section 506,

AFMAN 33-326, <i class="calibre3">Preparing Official Communications, </i>Attachment 2, outlines the authorized users and uses of the seal or any part thereof.

Official Air Force Symbol:</b></p><p class="msonormal53">8.4.1. The Air Force Symbol (Figure 8.15) was designated the official symbol of the U.S. Air Force on 5 May 2004<b class="calibre1">.</b> The Symbol honors the heritage of our past and represents the promise of our future. Furthermore, the symbol retains the core elements of our Air Corps heritage—the “Arnold” wings and star with circle—and modernizes them to reflect our air and space force of today and tomorrow.</p><p class="msonormal54"><img src="image049.png" v:shapes="Group_x0020_842701 Picture_x0020_64158 Picture_x0020_64160" class="calibre18"><b class="calibre1">Figure 8.15. Air Force Symbol </b>8.4.2. The Symbol has two main parts. In the upper half, the stylized wings represent the stripes of our strength—our enlisted men and women. The wings are drawn with great angularity to emphasize our swiftness and power and are divided into six sections which represent our distinctive capabilities—air and space superiority, global attack, rapid global mobility, precision engagement, information superiority, and agile combat support.</p><p class="msonormal28">8.4.3. In the lower half are a sphere, a star, and three diamonds. The sphere within the star represents the globe. Moreover, the symbol reminds us of our obligation to secure our Nation’s freedom with global vigilance, reach, and power. The globe also reminds us of our challenge as an expeditionary force to respond rapidly to crises and to provide decisive air and space power worldwide.</p>
    <p class="msonormal55">8.4.4. The area surrounding the sphere takes the shape of a star. The star has many</p><p class="msonormal56">meanings. The five points represent the components of our one force and family—our Regular Air Force, civilians, Guard, Reserve, and retirees. The star symbolizes space as the high ground of our nation’s air and space force. The rallying symbol in all our wars, the star also represents our officer corps, central to our combat leadership.</p><p class="msonormal57">8.4.5. The star is framed with three diamonds that represent our core values—integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do. The elements come together to form one symbol that presents two powerful images—at once an eagle, the emblem of our Nation; and a medal, representing valor in service to our Nation.</p><p class="msonormal58">8.4.6.

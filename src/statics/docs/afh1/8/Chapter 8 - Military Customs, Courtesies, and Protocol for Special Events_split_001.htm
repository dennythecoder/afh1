<p class="msonormal42">8.2.4.3.8. When the flag is suspended across a
corridor or lobby in a building with only one main entrance, the flag should be
suspended vertically with the union of the flag to the observer’s left upon
entering. If the building has more than one main entrance, the flag should be
suspended vertically near the center of the corridor or lobby with the union to
the north when entrances are to the east and west or to the east when entrances
are to the north and south. If there are entrances in more than two directions,
the union should be to the east. This includes aircraft hangars. </p>

<p class="msonormal43">8.2.4.3.9. When three flag staffs are positioned outside a
building, there may be two display options. If the flag staffs are in a
straight line, then the flags should be of the same height with the U.S. flag
to its own right. Use the building looking out to the flags as the point of
reference for flag placement when flags are in line. If the flag is positioned
on the center staff, then the center staff must be higher than the other two
staffs. </p>

<p class="msonormal42">8.2.4.3.10. On a closed casket, place the flag
lengthwise with the union at the head and over the left shoulder of the
deceased (Figure 8.11). When a full-couch casket is opened, remove the flag,
fold to the triangular shape of a cocked hat, and place in the lid at the head
end of the casket and just above the decedent’s left shoulder. When a
half-couch casket is opened, fold the flag on the lower half of the casket in the
same relative position as when displayed full length on a closed casket. Do not
lower the flag into the grave, and do not allow the flag to touch the ground.
The interment flag may be given to the next of kin at the conclusion of the
interment. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">8.2.5.<b class="calibre1"> Respect for the U.S. Flag. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal15">No disrespect should be
shown to the U.S. flag; the flag will not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental
colors, state flags, and </p>

<p class="msonormal12">organizational or institutional flags
are always dipped as a mark of respect to the U.S. flag. However, the Air Force
flag and organizational flags will be dipped as appropriate. Military members
will render the military salute as appropriate. At no time will a foreign
national flag be dipped. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.2.5.1. The flag should never be displayed
with union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme
danger to life or property. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">8.2.5.2. The flag should never touch
anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise. The
flag should never be used as the covering for a statue or monument, although
the flag could form a distinctive feature in a ceremony of the unveiling of a
statue or monument. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.2.5.3. The flag should never be carried
flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free. </p>

<p class="msonormal46">8.2.5.4. The flag should never be used as
wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. The flag should never be festooned, drawn
back, up, or in folds, but always allowed to fall free (for example, the flag
should not be used to cover a speaker’s podium, drape the front of a platform,
or for other decoration. A proper substitute is bunting of blue, white, and
red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red
below). </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.2.5.5. The flag should never be fastened,
displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit the flag to be easily
torn, soiled, or damaged. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.2.5.6. The flag should never be used as a
covering for a ceiling. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.2.5.7. The flag should never have placed
upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter,
word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.2.5.8. The flag should never be used as a
receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">8.2.5.9. The flag should never be used for
advertising purposes or be embroidered on such articles as cushions or
handkerchiefs. Moreover, the flag should not be printed or otherwise impressed
on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and
discard. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from
which the flag is flown. </p>

<p class="msonormal47">8.2.5.10. No part of the flag should
be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed
to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of
patriotic organizations. A lapel flag pin, being a replica of the flag, should
be worn on the left lapel near the heart. Patches worn on uniforms depicting
the U.S. flag should be worn on the left shoulder, with the union to the
viewer’s left. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.2.5.11. The flag should not be displayed on
a float in a parade except from a staff. </p>

<p class="msonormal48">8.2.5.12. The flag should not be draped over
the hood, top, sides, or back of a vehicle, railroad train, or boat. When the
flag is displayed on an automobile, the staff should be fixed firmly to the
chassis or clamped to the right fender. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">8.2.5.13. No other flag or pennant
should be placed above or, if on the same level, to the right (observer’s left)
of the U.S. flag, except during church services conducted by naval chaplains at
sea when the church pennant may be flown above the flag during church services
for the personnel of the Navy. </p>

<p class="msonormal51">8.2.6.2. The responsible military commander
ensures the procedures for flying the flag at half-staff are executed as
follows: </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.2.6.2.1. The term “half-staff” means the
position of the flag when the flag is one-half the distance between the top and
bottom of the staff. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.2.6.2.2. When flown at half-staff, first
hoist the flag to the peak for an instant and then lower to the half-staff
position. Raise the flag again to the peak position before lowering the flag
for the end of the day. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.2.6.3. The flag is flown at half-staff
outside the U.S. on Department of Defense buildings, grounds, and naval vessels
even if another nation’s flag is flown full staff next to the U.S. flag. </p>

<p class="msonormal28">8.2.6.4. All flags displayed with the U.S.
flag are flown at half-staff when the U.S. flag is flown at half-staff, with
the exception of foreign national flags, unless the foreign country has granted
permission for their flag to also be at half-staff. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">8.2.6.5. The Heads of Department of
Defense components may direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on
buildings, grounds, or naval vessels under their jurisdiction on occasions when
they consider the flag be flown at half-staff proper and appropriate. Within
the Air Force, this authority is delegated to the installation commander. Any
time an installation commander decides to fly the flag at half-staff based on
this local authority for a local death, state the reason on the base marquees
to avoid confusion.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal8">8.2.7.<b class="calibre1"> Care and Disposition of U.S. Flags. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal52">Exercise extreme care to ensure proper
handling and cleaning of soiled flags. Professionally mend a torn flag, but
destroy a badly torn or tattered flag. Title 4, U.S. Code, Chapter 1, states:
"The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting
emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by
burning." There may be instances when a flag is retired from service and
preserved because of its historical significance. In this case, the unit must
request disposition instructions from the proper authority, such as the
installation honor guard or protocol office. </p>

<p class="msonormal53"><b class="calibre1">8.3. Department of the Air Force Seal:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal54">8.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Description.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">The official Air Force colors of ultramarine
blue and Air Force yellow are reflected in the Air Force Seal; the circular
background is ultramarine blue, and the trim is Air Force yellow (Figure 8.14).
The 13 white stars represent the original 13 colonies. The Air Force yellow
numerals under the shield stand for 1947, the year the Department of the Air
Force was established. The band encircling the whole design is white edged in
Air Force yellow with black lettering reading “Department of the Air Force” on
the top and “U.S. of America” on the bottom. Centered on the circular
background is the Air Force Coat of Arms, consisting of the crest and shield. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">8.3.1.1. The crest consists of the
eagle, wreath, and cloud form. The American bald eagle symbolizes the U.S. air
power, and appears in natural colors. The wreath under the eagle is made up of
six alternate folds of metal (white, representing silver) and light blue. This
repeats the metal and color used in the shield. The white clouds behind the
eagle denote the start of a new sky. </p>

<p class="msonormal47">8.3.1.2. The shield, directly below the
eagle and wreath, is divided horizontally into two parts by a nebular line
representing clouds. The top part bears an Air Force yellow thunderbolt with
flames in natural color that shows striking power through the use of aerospace.
The thunderbolt consists of an Air Force yellow vertical twist with three
natural color flames on each end crossing a pair of horizontal wings with eight
lightning bolts. The background of the top part is light blue representing the
sky. The lower part is white representing metal silver. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">8.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> Authorized and Unauthorized Uses of the
Seal and Coat of Arms.<span class="calibre2">  </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal55">Title 18, United States Code, Section
506, <i class="calibre3">Seals of Departments or Agencies</i>,
protects the Air Force seal from unauthorized use. Falsely making, forging,
counterfeiting, mutilating, or altering the seal or knowingly using or
possessing with fraudulent intent any such altered seal is punishable by law.
AFMAN 33-326, <i class="calibre3">Preparing Official
Communications, </i>Attachment 2, outlines the authorized users and uses of the
seal or any part thereof. The Coat of Arms is authorized for unofficial use
when approved by the Secretary of the Air Force of Public Affairs (SAF/PA).
This approving authority was delegated to the Air Force Public Affairs Agency
(AFPAA), a Field Operating Agency of SAF/PA. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">8.4. Official Air Force Symbol: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal56">8.4.1. The Air Force Symbol (Figure 8.15) was designated the
official symbol of the U.S. Air Force on 5 May 2004<b class="calibre1">.</b> The Symbol honors the heritage of our past and represents the promise
of our future. Furthermore, the symbol retains the core elements of our Air
Corps heritage—the “Arnold” wings and star with circle—and modernizes them to
reflect our air and space force of today and tomorrow. </p>

<p class="msonormal57"><b class="calibre1">Figure 8.15. Air Force Symbol </b></p>

<p class="msonormal14">8.4.2. The Symbol has two main parts. In the
upper half, the stylized wings represent the stripes of our strength—our
enlisted men and women. The wings are drawn with great angularity to emphasize
our swiftness and power and are divided into six sections which represent our
distinctive capabilities—air and space superiority, global attack, rapid global
mobility, precision engagement, information superiority, and agile combat
support. </p>

CUSTOMS, COURTESIES, AND PROTOCOL FOR SPECIAL EVENTS </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">8.1.<i class="calibre3"> </i>Introduction.
</b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">Military customs and courtesies are proven traditions that
explain what should and should not be done in many situations. They are acts of
respect and courtesy when dealing with other people, and have evolved as a
result of the need for order, as well as the mutual respect and sense of
fraternity that exists among military personnel. Military customs and
courtesies go beyond basic politeness; they play an extremely important role in
building morale, esprit de corps, discipline, and mission effectiveness.
Customs and courtesies ensure proper respect for the military members and build
the foundation for self-discipline. Customs and courtesies are outlined in four
sections: Symbols, Professional Behavior, Drill and Ceremony, and Honor Guard.
Not all-inclusive, this chapter highlights many of the customs and courtesies
that make the Air Force and its people special. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">8.2. The United States (U.S.) Flag. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre3">The
flag of the U.S. has not been created by rhetorical sentences in declarations
of independence and in bills of rights. It has been created by the experience
of a great people, and nothing is written upon it that has not been written by
their life. It is the embodiment, not of a sentiment, but of a history. </i></p>

<b class="calibre1">Laws of the U.S. Flag.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal9">The laws relating to the flag of the U.S. of
America are outlined in detail in the United States Code. Title 4, United

pertains to the seal; Chapter 3 pertains to the seat of the Government; and
Chapter 4 pertains to the States; and Title 36, United States Code, <i class="calibre3">Patriotic and National Observances,
Ceremonies, and Organizations</i>, Chapter 1, pertains to patriotic customs and

laws. See AFI 34-1201, <i class="calibre3">Protocol</i>, and

Air Force-specific guidance on protocol, decorum, customs and courtesies for

<b class="calibre1">Position and Manner of Display.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">The following rules will be observed: </p>

<p class="msonormal18">8.2.4.1. When carried in a procession
with another flag or flags, the flag of the U.S. should be either on the
marching right; that is, to the flag’s own right (to the far right of all
others) (Figure 8.1), or, if there is a line of other flags, in front of the
center line. This also applies when flags are displayed in a stationary
position. Flags carried by Airmen are never at half-staff. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.2.4.2. The U.S. flag, when displayed with
another flag against a wall from crossed staffs, should be on the right, the
flag’s own right (observer’s left), and the staff should be in front of the
staff of the other flag (Figure 8.2). </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.2.4.3. When the U.S. flag is displayed from
a flagstaff with other flags, the following applies: </p>

<p class="msonormal16">8.2.4.3.1. When a number of flags are grouped
and displayed from staffs radiating from a central point, and no foreign flags
are in the display, the U.S. flag will be in the center and at the highest
point of the group as shown in Figure 8.3. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">8.2.4.3.2. When a number of flags are
displayed from staffs set in a line, all staffs will be of the same height and
same finial. The U.S. flag will be at the right, which is to the left of an
observer facing the display (Figure 8.4). However, if no foreign national flags
are involved in the display, the U.S. flag may be placed at the center of the
line when displayed at a higher level than the other flags in the display
(Figure 8.5). </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre8"><span class="calibre2"> </span></span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">8.2.4.3.3. When flags of two or more nations
are displayed, they are flown from separate staffs of the same height. The
flags should be of equal size. International usage prescribes the display of
the flag of one nation equal to that of another nation in time of peace. The
flags are displayed in a line, alphabetically, using the English alphabet, with
the U.S. flag at its own right (the observer’s left). When in North Atlantic
Treaty Organization countries, North Atlantic Treaty Organization member
country flags are displayed in French alphabetical order. </p>

<p class="msonormal29">8.2.4.3.4. When the U.S. flag is
displayed from a staff projecting horizontally or at an angle from the
windowsill, balcony, or front of a building, the union (or blue field) of the
flag should be placed at the peak of the staff (Figure 8.6). </p>

<p class="msonormal30">8.2.4.3.5. When displayed either
horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost and to
the flag’s own right; that is, to the observer’s left (Figure 8.7). When
displayed in a window, the flag should be displayed in the same way, with the
union to the left of observer in the street (Figure 8.8). </p>

<p class="msonormal36">8.2.4.3.6. When the flag is displayed over the<b class="calibre1"> </b>middle of the street, the flag should
be suspended vertically with the union to the north on an east and west street
or to the east on a north and south street. </p>

<p class="msonormal37">8.2.4.3.7. When used on a speaker’s platform, the
flag, if displayed flat, should be displayed above and behind the speaker
(Figure 8.9). When displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium, the
U.S. flag should hold the position of superior prominence and in the position
of honor at the clergyman’s or speaker’s right as he or she faces the audience.
Any other flag so displayed should be placed on the left of the clergyman or
speaker or to the right of the audience (Figure 8.10). </p>

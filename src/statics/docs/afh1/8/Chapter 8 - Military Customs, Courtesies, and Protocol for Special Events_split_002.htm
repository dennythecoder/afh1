<p class="msonormal28">8.4.3. In the lower half are a sphere, a
star, and three diamonds. The sphere within the star represents the globe.
Moreover, the symbol reminds us of our obligation to secure our Nation’s
freedom with global vigilance, reach, and power. The globe also reminds us of
our challenge as an expeditionary force to respond rapidly to crises and to
provide decisive air and space power worldwide. </p>

<p class="msonormal58">8.4.4. The area surrounding the sphere
takes the shape of a star. The star has many meanings. The five points
represent the components of our one force and family—our Regular Air Force,
civilians, Guard, Reserve, and retirees. The star symbolizes space as the high
ground of our nation’s air and space force. The rallying symbol in all our
wars, the star also represents our officer corps, central to our combat
leadership. </p>

<p class="msonormal46">8.4.5. The star is framed with three diamonds
that represent our core values—integrity first, service before self, and
excellence in all we do. The elements come together to form one symbol that
presents two powerful images—at once an eagle, the emblem of our Nation; and a
medal, representing valor in service to our Nation. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">8.5. Respect for the Flag.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal61">The procedures to use when showing respect to the flag and
the national anthem include: </p>

<p class="msonormal62">8.5.1. When outdoors, all personnel in uniform, except
those in formation must face the flag and salute during the raising and
lowering of the flag. Upon the first note of the national anthem or “To the
Colors,” all personnel in uniform who are not in formation will stand at
attention, face the flag (or the sound of the music, if the flag is not
visible), and salute. Hold the salute until the last note of the national
anthem or “To the Colors” is played. </p>

<p class="msonormal61">8.5.2. All vehicles in motion will pull to the side of the
road and stop. All occupants sit quietly until the last note of the national
anthem or “To the Colors” has played. </p>

<p class="msonormal61">8.5.3. When in civilian clothes, face the flag (or the sound
of the music if the flag is not visible) and stand at attention with the right
hand placed over the heart or render a salute. </p>

<p class="msonormal63">8.5.4. If indoors during retreat or reveille, there is no
need to stand or salute. However, everyone must stand during the playing of the
national anthem before a showing of a movie while in the base theater. When
listening to a radio or watching television, no specific action is necessary.
Additionally, a folded flag is considered cased; therefore, a salute is not
necessary.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal64"><b class="calibre1">8.6. Saluting. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal63">The salute is a courteous exchange of greetings, with the
junior member always saluting the senior member first. A salute is also
rendered to the flag as a sign of respect. Any Airman, NCO, or officer
recognizing a need to salute or a need to return a salute may do so anywhere at
any time. When returning or rendering an individual salute, the head and eyes
are turned toward the flag or person saluted. Guidance when exchanging salutes
includes: </p>

<p class="msonormal8">8.6.1.<b class="calibre1"> Outdoors.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal65">Salutes are exchanged upon recognition
between officers or warrant officers and enlisted members of the Armed Forces
when they are in uniform. Saluting outdoors means salutes are exchanged when
the persons involved are outside of a building. For example, if a person is on
a porch, a covered sidewalk, a bus stop, a covered or open entryway, or a
reviewing stand, the salute will be exchanged with a person on the sidewalk
outside of the structure or with a person approaching or in the same structure.
This applies both on and off military installations. The junior member should
initiate the salute in time to allow the senior officer to return it. To
prescribe an exact distance for all circumstances is not practical; however,
good judgment should dictate when salutes are exchanged. Superiors carrying
articles in both hands need not return the salute, but should nod in return or
verbally acknowledge the salute. If the junior member is carrying articles in
both hands, verbal greetings should be exchanged. Also, use the same procedures
when greeting an officer of a foreign nation. Use these procedures in: </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.6.1.1.<b class="calibre1">
Formation.</b> Members do not salute or return a salute unless given the
command to do so. The person in charge salutes and acknowledges salutes for the
whole formation. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">8.6.1.2.<b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3"> </i>Groups, But Not in
Formation.</b> When a senior officer approaches, the first individual noticing
the officer calls the group to attention. All members face the officer and
salute. If the officer addresses an individual or the group, all remain at
attention (unless otherwise ordered) until the end of the conversation, at
which time they salute the officer. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.6.1.3.<b class="calibre1">
Public Gatherings. </b>Salutes between individuals are not required in public
gatherings, such as sporting events, meetings, or when a salute would be
inappropriate or impractical. </p>

<p class="msonormal46">8.6.1.4.<b class="calibre1">
Moving Military Vehicles. </b>Exchange of salutes between military pedestrians
(including gate sentries) and officers in moving military vehicles is not
mandatory. However, when officer passengers are readily identifiable (for
example, officers in appropriately marked staff vehicles), the salute must be
rendered. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">8.6.1.5.<b class="calibre1"> The Presence of Civilians. </b>Persons in uniform may salute
civilians. The President of the U.S., as Commander in Chief of the Armed
Forces, is always accorded the honor of a salute. AFI 34-1201 provides
additional guidance. In addition, if the exchange of salutes is otherwise
appropriate, customs encourage military members in civilian clothes to exchange
salutes upon recognition. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.6.1.6.<b class="calibre1">
A Work Detail. </b>In a work detail, individual workers do not salute. The
person in charge salutes for the entire detail. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.6.1.7. <b class="calibre1">Military
Funeral. </b>When at a military funeral in uniform, salute the caisson or
hearse as it passes and the casket as it is carried by your position. You also
salute during the firing of volleys and the playing of “Taps.” </p>

<p class="msonormal8">8.6.2.
<b class="calibre1">Indoors.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Except for formal reporting, salutes are not
rendered. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">8.7. Military Etiquette. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal61">Etiquette is defined as common, everyday courtesy. The
military world, like the civilian world, functions more smoothly and pleasantly
when members practice good manners. </p>

<p class="msonormal66">8.7.1. Simple things like saying “please” and “thank you”
help the organization run smoother because people respond more enthusiastically
when asked in a courteous manner to do something. They also appreciate knowing
their efforts are recognized when told “thank you.” </p>

<p class="msonormal67">8.7.2. One of the most valuable habits anyone can develop is
to be on time for appointments. Granted, sometimes a person cannot avoid being
late. When this happens, the best course of action is to call ahead or to
reschedule the appointment. Do not keep others waiting. 8.7.3. Address civil
service employees properly. As a rule, address them appropriately as “Mr.,”
“Mrs.,” “Miss,” or “Ms.” and their last name, unless requested to do otherwise.
Always address a superior formally. This is especially important in most
foreign countries where using first names on the job is much more limited than
in the U.S. </p>

<p class="msonormal66">8.7.4. Don’t gossip<b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">.</i></b> A discussion of personal habits,
problems, and activities (real or rumored) of others often results in quarrels
and disputes among people who work together. The morale of any unit may suffer
because of feuds that arise from gossip. The best policy is not to gossip and
to discourage others from gossiping. </p>

<p class="msonormal68">8.7.5. Use proper telephone etiquette<b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">.</i></b><i class="calibre3"> </i>Always be polite and identify yourself
and your organization. When an individual is not available to take a call, ask:
“May I take a message?” or “Is there something I may help you with?” If taking
a message to return a call, write down the individual’s name, organization,
telephone number, the message, and then pass this information along to the
intended recipient. </p>

<p class="msonormal61">8.7.6. Do not lean or sit on desks. Also, do not lean back
in a chair or put feet on desks. This type of conduct doesn’t present a
professional military image. </p>

<p class="msonormal61">8.7.7. In general, use common sense, be considerate of other
people, and insist your subordinates do the same. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">8.8.</b> <b class="calibre1">Courtesies to Other Services:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal69">8.8.1. The collective efforts of the Air Force, Army,
Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard provide for the defense of the country against
aggression. All Services are part of the military team; therefore, extend the
same military courtesies to members of the other Services. While there is a
friendly natural rivalry between the Services, military courtesies among
Services remain the same. Thus, the members of the other Services are as much
comrades-in-arms as are any Airmen. </p>

<p class="msonormal70">8.8.2. This is equally true of the friendly armed
forces of the United Nations. Salute all commissioned officers and pay the same
respect to the national anthems and flags of other nations as rendered the U.S.
national anthem and flag. While not necessary to learn the identifying insignia
of the military grades of all nations, you should learn the insignia of the
most frequently contacted nations, particularly during an overseas assignment
or deployment. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">8.9. Respect and Recognition: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal8">8.9.1.<b class="calibre1"> Common Acts of Courtesy. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Common acts of courtesy among all Air Force
personnel aid in maintaining discipline and promoting the smooth conduct of
affairs in the military establishment. When courtesy falters within a unit,
discipline ceases to function, and accomplishing the mission is endangered.
Many of the Air Force courtesies involve the salute. There are, however, many
other courtesies commonly extended to superiors, subordinates, and working
associates. Some acts of courtesies include: </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.9.1.1. Giving the senior person, enlisted
or commissioned, the position of honor when walking, riding, or sitting with
him or her at all times. The junior person takes the position to the senior’s
left. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">8.9.1.2. When reporting to an officer
indoors, knock once and enter when told to do so. Upon entering, march to
approximately two paces from the officer or desk, halt, salute, and report in
this manner: “Sir (Ma’am), Airman Smith reports as ordered,” or “Sir (Ma’am),
Airman Smith reports.” When the conversation is completed, execute a sharp
salute and hold until the officer acknowledges the salute, then perform the
appropriate facing movements and depart. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.9.1.3. Unless told otherwise, rise and
stand at attention when a senior official enters or departs a room. If more
than one person is present, the person who first sees the officer calls the
group to attention. However, if an officer is already in the room who is equal
to or has a higher rank than the officer entering the room, do not call the
room to attention. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">8.9.1.4. Military personnel enter automobiles
and small boats in reverse order of rank. Juniors will enter a vehicle first
and take their appropriate seat on the senior’s left. The senior officer will
be the last to enter the vehicle and the first to leave. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Section 8D—Drill and Ceremony</i> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal88"><b class="calibre1">8.10. Flag Ceremonies:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal8">8.10.1.<b class="calibre1"> Reveille.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal89">The signal for the start of the
official duty day is the reveille. Because the time for the start of the duty
day varies between bases, the commander designates the specified time for
reveille. If the commander desires, a reveille ceremony may accompany the
raising of the flag. This ceremony takes place after sunrise near the base
flagstaff. In the unit area, reveille is normally held using the formation of
squadron in line. This formation is used when a reveille ceremony is not held
at the base flagstaff. Procedures for reveille include: </p>

<p class="msonormal11">8.10.1.1. Shortly before the specified
time, Airmen march to a pre-designated position near the base flagstaff, halt,
face toward the flagstaff, and dress. The flag security detail arrives at the
flagstaff at this time and remains at attention. </p>

<p class="msonormal90">8.10.1.2. The unit commander (or senior
participant) commands “Parade, REST.” </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.10.1.3. At the specified time for reveille,
the unit commander commands “SOUND REVEILLE.” The flag detail assumes the
position of attention, moves to the flagstaff, and attaches the flag to the
halyards. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">8.10.1.4. After reveille is played,
the unit commander commands “Squadron, ATTENTION” and “Present, ARMS” and then
faces the flagstaff and executes present arms. On this signal, the national
anthem or “To the Colors” is sounded. 8.10.1.5. On the first note of the
national anthem or “To the Colors,” the flag security detail begins to raise
the flag briskly. The senior member of the detail holds the flag to keep the
flag from touching the ground. </p>

<p class="msonormal91">8.10.1.6. The unit commander holds the salute
until the last note of the national anthem or “To the Colors” is played. Then
he or she executes order arms, faces about, and commands “Order, ARMS.” The
Airmen are then marched back to the dismissal area. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">8.10.2.<b class="calibre1"> Raising the Flag: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.10.2.1. When practical, a detail consisting
of one NCO and two Airmen hoists the flag. This detail should carry sidearms if
the special equipment of the guard includes sidearms. </p>

<p class="msonormal47">8.10.2.2. The detail forms in line
with the NCO carrying the flag in the center. The detail then marches to the
flagstaff and halts, and the flag is attached to the halyards. The flag is
always raised and lowered from the leeward side of the flagstaff. The two
Airmen attend the halyards, taking a position facing the staff to hoist the
flag without entangling the halyards. </p>

<p class="msonormal52">8.10.2.3. The NCO continues to hold the flag
until hoisted clear of his or her grasp, taking particular care that no portion
of the flag touches the ground. When the flag is clear of the grasp, the NCO
comes to attention and executes present arms. </p>

<p class="msonormal92">8.10.2.4. On the last note of the
national anthem, “To the Colors,” or after the flag has been hoisted to the
staff head, all members of the detail execute order arms on command of the
senior member. The halyards are then secured to the cleat of the staff or, if
appropriate, the flag is lowered to half-staff and the halyards are secured.
The detail is formed again and then marches to the dismissal area. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">8.10.3.<b class="calibre1"> Retreat Ceremony: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal65">8.10.3.1. The retreat ceremony<i class="calibre3"> </i>serves a twofold purpose: signals the
end of the official duty day and serves as a ceremony for paying respect to the
U.S. flag. Because the time for the end of the duty day varies, the commander
designates the time for the retreat ceremony. The retreat ceremony may take
place at the squadron area, on the base parade ground, or near the base
flagstaff. If conducted within the squadron area, the ceremony usually does not
involve a parade. If conducted at the base parade ground, retreat may be part of
the parade ceremony. For retreat ceremonies conducted at the base flagstaff,
the units participating may be formed in line or massed, depending on the size
and number of units and the space available. </p>

<p class="msonormal92">8.10.3.2. Shortly before the specified
time for retreat, the band and Airmen participating in the ceremony are
positioned facing the flagstaff and dressed. If marching to and from the
flagstaff, the band precedes the Airmen participating in the ceremony. </p>

<p class="msonormal93">8.10.3.3. If the band and Airmen march to the
flagstaff, a flag security detail also marches to the flagstaff and halts, and
the senior member gives the command “Parade, REST” to the security detail. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.10.3.4. As soon as the Airmen are dressed,
the commander commands “Parade, REST.” The commander then faces the flagstaff,
assumes the position of the Airmen, and waits for the specified time for
retreat. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">8.10.3.5. At the specified time, the
commander orders the bandleader to sound retreat by commanding “SOUND RETREAT.”
</p>

<p class="msonormal11">8.10.3.6. The band plays retreat. If a
band is not present, recorded music is played over the base public address
system. During the playing of retreat, junior members of the flag security
detail assume the position of attention and move to the flagstaff to arrange
the halyards for proper lowering of the flag. Once the halyards are arranged,
the junior members of the flag security detail execute parade rest in unison. </p>

<p class="msonormal29">8.10.3.7. Uniformed military members
not assigned to a formation face the flag (if visible) or the music and assume
the position of parade rest on the first note of retreat. Upon completion of
retreat, they should assume the position of attention and salute on the first
note of the national anthem or “To the Colors.” </p>

<p class="msonormal12">8.10.3.8. After the band plays
retreat, the commander faces about and commands “Squadron (Group, etc.),
ATTENTION.” 8.10.3.9. The commander then commands “Present, ARMS.” As soon as
the Airmen execute present arms, the commander faces to the front and also
assumes present arms. The members of the flag security detail execute present
arms on command of the commander. </p>

<p class="msonormal94">8.10.3.10. The band plays the national
anthem, or the bugler plays “To the Colors.” The junior members of the flag
security detail lower the flag slowly and with dignity. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">8.10.3.11. The commander executes order arms
when the last note of the national anthem or “To the Colors” is played and the
flag is securely grasped. The commander faces about, gives the Airmen “Order,
ARMS,” and then faces to the front. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">8.10.3.12. The flag
security detail folds the flag as illustrated in Figure 8.17. The senior member
of the detail remains at attention while the flag is folded unless needed to
control the flag. </p>

<p class="msonormal95"><span class="calibre2"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal96">8.10.3.13. When the flag is folded, the flag
security detail, with the senior member on the right and the flag bearer in the
center, marches to a position three paces from the commander. (<b class="calibre1">Note:<i class="calibre3">
</i></b>In an informal ceremony, the detail marches three paces from the
officer of the day.) The senior member salutes and reports “Sir (Ma’am), the
flag is secured.” The commander returns the salute, and the flag security
detail marches away. The Airmen are then marched to their areas and dismissed. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">8.10.4.<b class="calibre1"> Lowering the Flag: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal99">8.10.4.1. When practical, the persons
lowering the flag should be one NCO and three Airmen for the all-purpose flag
and one NCO and five Airmen for the installation flag. </p>

<p class="msonormal100">8.10.4.2. The detail is formed and marched to
the flagstaff. The halyards are detached and attended from the leeward side.
8.10.4.3. On the first note of the national anthem or “To the Colors,” the
members of the detail not lowering the flag execute present arms. The lowering
of the flag is coordinated with the playing of the music so the two are
completed at the same time. 8.10.4.4. The senior member commands the detail
“Order, ARMS” when the flag is low enough to be received. If at half-staff,
briskly hoist the flag to the staff head while retreat is sounded and then
lower on the first note of the national anthem or “To the Colors.” </p>

<p class="msonormal101">8.10.4.5. The flag is detached from the
halyards and folded. The halyards are secured to the staff. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">8.10.5.<b class="calibre1"> Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal102">The Pledge of Allegiance to the flag,
“I pledge allegiance to the flag of the U.S. of America and to the Republic for
which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice
for all” should be rendered by standing at attention and facing the flag. When
not in uniform, persons should remove any non-religious headdress with their
right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, with the hand being over the
heart. Persons in uniform should remain silent, face the flag, and render the
military salute if outdoors and indoors if in formation and wearing appropriate
headdress. If indoors and without headdress, military members should stand at
attention, remain silent, and face the flag. Military members in uniform do not
recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag. </p>

<p class="msonormal103">8.10.6.<b class="calibre1"> Flag Folding Ceremony.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal18">Although several flag folding ceremony
options are offered by various national interest groups, these are not official
Air Force ceremonies. According to Title 4, United States Code, no specific
meaning is assigned to the folds of the flag. The Air Force developed a script
that provides a historical perspective on the flag. There are no ceremonies in
the Air Force requiring a script to be read when the flag is folded. However,
when a flag folding ceremony is desired and conducted by Air Force personnel at
any location, on or off an installation, this script is the only one that may
be used. Refer back to Figure 8.17 for the proper method for folding the U.S.
flag and Figure 8.18 for a copy of this script. </p>

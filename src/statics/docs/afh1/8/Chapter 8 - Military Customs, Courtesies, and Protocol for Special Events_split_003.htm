<h1 class="calibre46" id="calibre_pb_0">Flag Folding Ceremony </h1>

<p class="msonormal105"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre47">Air Force
Script </span></b>For more than 200 years, the American flag has been the
symbol of our Nation’s unity, as well as a source of pride and inspiration for
millions of citizens. </p>

<p class="msonormal106">Born on June 14, 1777, the Second
Continental Congress determined that the flag of the U.S. be 13 stripes,
alternating between 7 red and 6 white; and that the union be 13 stars, white in
a blue field representing a new constellation. (1) </p>

<p class="msonormal106">Between 1777 and 1960, the shape
and design of the flag evolved into the flag presented before you today. The 13
horizontal stripes represent the original 13 colonies, while the stars
represent the 50 states of the Union. The colors of the flag are symbolic as
well; red symbolizes hardiness and valor; white signifies purity and innocence;
and blue represents vigilance, perseverance, and justice. (1) </p>

<p class="msonormal107">Traditionally, a symbol of
liberty, the American flag has carried the message of freedom, and inspired
Americans, both at home and abroad. </p>

<p class="msonormal106">In 1814, Francis Scott Key was so
moved at seeing the Stars and Stripes waving after the British shelling of
Baltimore’s Fort McHenry that he wrote the words to The Star Spangled Banner.
(2) </p>

<p class="msonormal108">In 1892 the flag inspired Francis
Bellamy to write the “Pledge of Allegiance,” our most famous flag salute and
patriotic oath. (2) </p>

<p class="msonormal106">In July 1969 the American flag was
“flown” in space when Neil Armstrong planted it on the surface of the moon. (2)
</p>

<p class="msonormal107">Today, our flag flies on constellations
of Air Force satellites that circle our globe, and on the fin flash of our
aircraft in harm’s way in every corner of the world. Indeed, it flies in the
heart of every Airman who serves our great Nation. The sun never sets on our
U.S. Air Force, nor on the flag we so proudly cherish. (2) </p>

<p class="msonormal106">Since 1776, no generation of
Americans has been spared the responsibility of defending freedom… Today’s
Airmen remain committed to preserving the freedom that others won for us for
generations to come. </p>

<p class="msonormal106">By displaying the flag and giving
it a distinctive fold we show respect to the flag and express our gratitude to
those individuals who fought, and continue to fight for freedom, at home and
abroad. Since the dawn of the 20th century, Airmen have proudly flown the flag
in every major conflict on lands and skies around the world. It is their
responsibility…our responsibility…to continue to protect and preserve the
rights, privileges, and freedoms that we, as Americans, enjoy today. The U.S.
flag represents who we are. It stands for the freedom we all share and the
pride and patriotism we feel for our country. We cherish its legacy as a beacon
of hope to one and all. Long may it wave. </p>

<p class="msonormal88"><b class="calibre1">8.11. Air Force Ceremonies.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal112">The Air Force has many different types of ceremonies
that are unique customs of our military profession. Some of these ceremonies
are very formal and elaborate, while others are quite simple and personal.
Award, decoration, promotion, reenlistment, and retirement ceremonies are a few
of the most common within the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal113"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.11.1.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Award
Ceremony. </b>An award ceremony affords an opportunity to recognize a member’s
accomplishments. The commander or other official determines whether to present
an award at a formal ceremony or to present it informally. Many units present
awards during commander’s call. Because there are no specific guidelines for an
award presentation, commanders and supervisors must ensure the presentation
method reflects the significance of the award.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal114"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.11.2.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Decoration
Ceremony:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal13"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.11.2.1.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Basic Guidelines.</b> Decoration ceremonies
formally recognize service members for meritorious service, outstanding
achievement, or heroism. A formal and dignified ceremony is necessary to
preserve the integrity and value of decorations. When possible, the commander
should personally present the decoration. Regardless of where the presentation
is conducted, the ceremony is conducted at the earliest possible date after
approval of the decoration. All military participants and attendees should wear
the uniform specified by the host. If in doubt, the Service Dress rather than
the Airman Battle Uniform is recommended. At the commander’s discretion, a
photographer may take pictures during the ceremony. </p>

<p class="msonormal13"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.11.2.2.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Procedures.</b> Although decoration
ceremonies may differ slightly from one unit to another, they normally begin by
announcing “ATTENTION TO ORDERS.” All members in attendance stand at attention
and face the commander and the recipient. The commander’s assistant reads the
citation while the commander and recipient stand at attention. After the
citation is read, the commander and recipient face each other, and the
commander affixes the medal on the individual’s uniform. The commander next
extends personal congratulations and a handshake while presenting the
decoration certificate. The recipient salutes the commander, and the commander
returns the salute to conclude the formal part of the ceremony. Attendees are
then invited to personally congratulate the recipient and enjoy any
refreshments provided. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">8.11.3.<b class="calibre1"> Promotion Ceremony:<i class="calibre3"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal12"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.11.3.1.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Basic Guidelines.</b><i class="calibre3"> </i>Promotions are significant events in the lives of military people.
Commanders and supervisors are responsible for ensuring their personnel receive
proper recognition. Many of the guidelines for promotion ceremonies are the
same as for decoration ceremonies. Because most promotions are effective the
first day of the month, the promotion ceremony is customarily conducted on the
last duty day before the promotion. Some bases hold a base-wide promotion for
all <span class="calibre2">promotees</span>; many organizations have operating
instructions detailing how promotion ceremonies will be conducted. </p>

<p class="msonormal65"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.11.3.2.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Procedures.</b> The national anthem,
reaffirmation of the Oath of Enlistment, and the Air Force Song are options
that add decorum to the event. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">8.11.4.<b class="calibre1"> Reenlistment Ceremony: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal115"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.11.4.1.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Basic Guidelines. </b>Unit commanders will
honor all <span class="calibre2">reenlistees</span> through a dignified
reenlistment ceremony. The Airman may request any commissioned officer to
perform the ceremony and may invite guests. The member’s immediate family
should be invited. This reinforces the fact that when a member makes a
commitment to the Air Force, the family is also making a commitment. Any
regular, reserve, guard, or retired commissioned officer of the U.S. Armed
Forces may perform the ceremony, which may be conducted in any place that lends
dignity to the event. The U.S. flag must form a backdrop for the participants. <span class="calibre2">Reenlistees</span> and reenlisting officers must wear an
authorized uniform for the ceremony. <b class="calibre1">Exception:</b>
The uniform requirement is optional for retired officers. </p>

<p class="msonormal12"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.11.4.2.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Procedures.</b> The core of the ceremony is
the Oath of Enlistment. The oath<b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3"> </i></b>is recited by the officer and
repeated by the <span class="calibre2">reenlistee</span>. The <span class="calibre2">reenlistee</span>
and the officer administering the oath must be physically collocated during the
ceremony. Once completed, the officer congratulates the <span class="calibre2">reenlistee</span>
and invites the other attendees to do the same. Refreshments may be served. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">8.11.5.<b class="calibre1"> Retirement Ceremony: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal46">8.11.5.1.<b class="calibre1">
Basic Guidelines. </b>Recognition upon retirement is a longstanding tradition
of military service. Each commander makes sure members leave with a tangible
expression of appreciation for their contributions to the Air Force mission and
with the assurance they will continue to be a part of the Air Force family in
retirement. Anyone involved in planning a retirement should consult AFI
36-3203, <i class="calibre3">Service Retirements,</i> for
complete details. The following paragraphs are extracts from AFI 36-3203: </p>

<p class="msonormal16"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.11.5.1.1.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span>Commanders are responsible for ensuring members
have a retirement ceremony to recognize their contributions. They must offer
the retiring member the courtesy of a formal ceremony in keeping with the customs
and traditions of the Service. If possible, a general officer conducts the
ceremony. Ceremonies held as part of formal military formations, such as
retreats and parades, are further encouraged if conditions permit. </p>

<p class="msonormal16"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.11.5.1.2.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span>During the retirement ceremony, the member
receives a certificate of retirement, a U.S. Flag, the Air Force retired lapel
button, Certificate of Appreciation for Service in the Armed Forces of the
U.S., and appropriate awards, decorations, honors, and letters of appreciation.
If possible, avoid using “dummy” elements that the member cannot keep. Family
members and friends should be invited and encouraged to attend the ceremony.
Furthermore, the member’s spouse is customarily presented with a certificate of
appreciation for the support and sacrifices made during the member’s career. </p>

<p class="msonormal16"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.11.5.1.3.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span>Commanders follow formal ceremony procedures
unless the member prefers otherwise. If the member doesn’t want a formal
ceremony or for any reason (leave or hospitalization) can’t be present for duty
on the retirement date, the commander personally presents all decorations and
any awards or honors to the member at another time. The retirement certificate
is not mailed to the member’s retirement address unless there is no other
choice. </p>

<p class="msonormal47">8.11.5.2.<b class="calibre1"> Procedures. </b>AFPAM 34-1202 outlines an approved sequence of events
for indoor retirement ceremonies. Figure 8.19 provides a general guideline that
may be used to assist in planning a retirement ceremony as well as many other
ceremonies. </p>

<p class="msonormal61">The Dining-In, Dining-Out, and Order of the Sword Induction

<p class="msonormal8">8.12.1.<b class="calibre1"> The Dining-In and Dining-Out: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal14"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.12.1.1.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span>The only
difference between a Dining-In and Dining-Out is that nonmilitary spouses,
friends, and civilians may attend a Dining-Out. The Dining-In is a formal
dinner for military members only. The present Dining-In format had its
beginnings in the Air Corps when General Henry H. “Hap” Arnold held his famous
wingdings. The association of Army Air Corps personnel with the British and
their Dining-In during World War II also encouraged their popularity in the Air
Force. Members now recognize the Dining-In as an occasion where ceremony,
tradition, and good fellowship serve an important purpose. </p>

<p class="msonormal14"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.12.1.2.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span>Specifically,
these ceremonies provide an occasion for Air Force members to meet socially at
formal military functions. They also provide an excellent means of saying
farewell to departing members and welcoming new ones, as well as providing the
opportunity to recognize individual and unit achievements. These are effective
in building and maintaining high morale and esprit de corps. Military members
who attend these ceremonies must wear the mess dress or the semiformal uniform.
Civilians wear the dress specified in the invitations. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">Induction into the Order of the Sword
is an honor reserved for individuals who have provided outstanding leadership
and support to enlisted members. The induction ceremony occurs at a formal
evening banquet held to honor the inductee as a “Leader among Leaders and an
Airman among Airmen.” The entire event is conducted with the dignity that
reflects its significance as the highest recognition enlisted member can bestow
on anyone. Each command has an Order of the Sword and develops their own
selection and induction procedures. </p>

</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Introduction
to Drill.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal65">For the purpose of drill, Air Force
organizations are divided into elements, flights, squadrons, groups, and wings.
Drill consists of certain movements by which the flight or squadron is moved in
an orderly manner from one formation to another or from one place to another.
Standards such as the 24-inch step, cadence of 100 to 120 steps per minute,
distance, and interval were established to ensure movements are executed with
order and precision. The task of each person is to learn these movements and
execute each part exactly as described. Individuals must also learn to adapt
their own movements to those of the group. Everyone in the formation must move
together on command. </p>

<p class="msonormal114"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.13.2.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Drill and
Ceremony.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal123">While the term “ceremony” was defined
earlier in this chapter, you should be note that certain ceremonies use drill.
In these events, ceremonies not only honor distinguished persons and recognize
special events, but also demonstrate the proficiency and training state of the
Airmen. Ceremonies are an extension of drill activities. The precision
marching, promptness in responding to commands, and teamwork developed on the
drill field determine the appearance and performance of the group in
ceremonies. The following paragraphs cover only the basic aspects of drill. For

<p class="msonormal124"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.13.3.1.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Drill Command.</b> A drill command is an
oral order that usually has two parts: the preparatory command and the command
of execution. The preparatory command explains what the movement will be. When
calling a unit to attention or halting a unit’s march, the preparatory command
includes the unit designation. In the command “Flight, HALT,” the word “Flight”
is the preparatory command and, at the same time, designates the unit. The
command of execution follows the preparatory command. The command of execution
explains when the movement will be carried out. In “Forward, MARCH,” the
command of execution is “MARCH.” </p>

<p class="msonormal123"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.13.3.2.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Supplementary Command.</b> A supplementary
command is given when one unit of the element must execute a movement different
from other units or the same movement at a different time. Examples include:
“CONTINUE THE MARCH” and “STAND FAST.” </p>

<p class="msonormal125"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.13.3.3.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Informational Command. </b>An informational

SQUADRON.” </p>

<p class="msonormal18"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.13.3.4.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Mass Commands. </b>The mass commands<b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3"> </i></b>help
develop confidence, self-reliance, assertiveness, and enthusiasm by making the
individual recall, give, and execute proper commands. Mass commands are usually
confined to simple movements, with short preparatory commands and commands of
execution carried out simultaneously by all elements of a unit. Each person is
required to give commands in unison with others as if this person alone were
giving the commands to the entire element. The volume of the combined voices
encourages every person to perform the movement with snap and precision. </p>

</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">General
Rules for Giving Commands.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">When giving commands, the commander is at the
position of attention. Good military bearing is necessary for good leadership.
While marching, the commander must be in step with the formation at all times.
The commander faces the Airmen when giving commands except when the element is
part of a larger drill element or when the commander is relaying commands in a
ceremony. </p>

<p class="msonormal114"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.13.5.<span class="calibre49">

Place the heels as near each other as the conformation of the body permits and
ensure the feet are turned out equally to form a 45-degree angle. Keep the legs
straight without stiffening or locking the knees. The body is erect with hips
level, chest lifted, back arched, and shoulders square and even. Arms hang
straight down alongside the body without stiffness and the wrists are straight
with the forearms. Place thumbs, which are resting along the first joint of the
forefinger, along the seams of the trousers or sides of the skirt. Hands are
cupped (but not clenched as a fist) with palms facing the leg. The head is kept
erect and held straight to the front, with the chin drawn slightly so the axis
of the head and neck is vertical; eyes are to the front with the line of sight
parallel to the ground. The weight of the body rests equally on the heels and
balls of both feet. Silence and immobility are required.<i class="calibre3"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal13"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.13.5.2.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Rest Positions.</b><i class="calibre3"> </i>There are four positions of rest: parade rest, at ease, rest, and
fall out. The commander and members of the formation must be at the position of
attention before going to any of the rest positions. To resume the position of
attention from any of the rests (except fall out, for which the commander uses
the command “FALL IN”), the command is “Flight, ATTENTION.” </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.13.5.2.1.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Parade
Rest.</b><i class="calibre3"> </i>(The command is “Parade,
REST.”) On the command “REST,” members of the formation raise the left foot
from the hip just enough to clear the ground and move smartly to the left so
the heels are 12 inches apart, as measured from the inside of the heels. Keep
the legs straight but not stiff and the heels on line. As the left foot moves,
bring the arms, fully extended, to the back of the body, <span class="calibre2">uncupping</span>
the hands in the process; extend and join the fingers, pointing them toward the
ground. Face the palms outwards. Place the right hand in the palm of the left,
right thumb over the left to form an “X.” Keep the head and eyes straight ahead
and remain silent and immobile. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.13.5.2.2.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">At Ease.</b><i class="calibre3"> </i>On the command “AT EASE,” members of
the formation may relax in a standing position, but they must keep the right
foot in place. Their position in the formation will not change; silence is
maintained. </p>

</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Fall Out.
</b>On the command “FALL OUT,” individuals may relax in a standing position or
break ranks. </p>

<p class="msonormal127">They must remain in the immediate area; no specific method
of dispersal is required. Moderate speech is permitted. </p>

</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">The
Flight as the Basic Drill Unit.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal13">The first phase of drill involves
teaching basic movements, facings, and positions either as an individual or as
a member of an element. The second phase of drill merges the individual with
others to form a flight in which base formations and marching are learned. The
flight is composed of at least two, but no more than four, elements. This
formation is the most practical drill group. </p>

<p class="msonormal129"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.13.7.2.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span>On this
command, each Airman will fall in and establish their dress, cover, interval,

on an individual basis and remains at the position of attention. </p>

<p class="msonormal130"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.13.7.3.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span>The flight
commander will then size the flight. Once all members are properly sized and in
column formation (Figure 8.21), the flight commander brings the flight back to
line formation. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.13.7.4.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span>To align
the flight in line formation, the commands are “Dress Right, DRESS” and “Ready,

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.13.7.5.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span>The flight
commander verifies the alignment of each rank then marches to three paces
beyond the front rank, faces toward the flight, and commands “Ready, FRONT.”

Distinguished Visitors, and Military Ceremonies </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">8.14. Base Honor Guard Program: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal137"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.14.1.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span>The primary mission of the base honor guard
program is to employ, equip, and train Air Force members to provide
professional military funeral honors for Regular Air Force, retired members,
and veterans of the U.S. Air Force. The Base Honor Guard Program is a mandatory
Air Force program and is the responsibility of the installation commander.
Members are usually volunteers from the installation host and tenant units,
with selections generally coming from the installation’s Airman Basic to
Technical Sergeant pool. The base honor guard emphasizes the importance of
military customs and courtesies, dress and appearance, and drill and
ceremonies. </p>

<p class="msonormal138"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.14.2.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span>The origins of the base honor guard can be
traced to May 1948 when Headquarters Command, U.S. Air Force, directed the
creation of an elite ceremonial unit comparable to those of the other Services.
The first base honor guard was activated within the 1100th Air Police Squadron,
<span class="calibre2">Bolling</span> Field, Washington District of Columbia, and
was responsible for maintaining an Air Force ceremonial capability in the
National Capitol Region. However, other Air Force installations worldwide
approached ceremonial responsibilities and military funeral honors quite
differently. </p>

<p class="msonormal138"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.14.3.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span>In January of 2000, public law was implemented,
providing for all veterans to receive, at a minimum, a funeral ceremony that
includes the folding of a U.S. flag, presentation of the flag to the veteran’s
family, and the playing of “Taps.” </p>

</span></span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Protocol
Defined.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal63">Protocol is the set of rules prescribing good manners in
official life and in ceremonies involving governments and nations and their
representatives. Protocol is an internationally recognized system of courtesy
and respect. Protocol for the military and government agencies is a code of
traditional precedence, courtesy, and etiquette in matters of military,
diplomatic, official, and celebratory ceremonies. Military protocol encompasses
the knowledge, accumulation and application of established service customs. In
modern practice, protocol combines the traditional codes of conduct with
contemporary etiquette and courtesy. The goal is to avoid disputes, insults,
embarrassment, and distractions by following a set of objective and generally
accepted criteria. As times change, so do the manners of the people; protocol
must keep pace with developing official life. Though only a guide, the
following sections will help you avoid protocol pitfalls. </p>

</span></span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Distinguished
Visitors (DV): </b></p>

<p class="msonormal140"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.16.1.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span>A DV may be defined as any: (1) general or flag
officer; (2) government official with rank equivalent to a brigadier general or
higher; (3) foreign military officer or civilian designated a DV by the Under
Secretary of the Air Force for International Affairs (SAF/IA); and (4) visitor
or group designated by the commander. Also, persons of lower rank, but in
certain positions, may be given DV status. At base level, for example,
colonels, civilian equivalents, and the Command Chief Master Sergeant may be
designated as DV by the commander. Many distinguished dignitaries, military and
civilian, domestic and foreign, visit Air Force installations for festive
occasions and official business. Reducing the frequency of ceremonial honors
rendered official visitors at field installations is of high importance. In the
interest of economy and efficiency, such ceremonies as parades, honor cordons,
motorcades, and other ceremonies that involve large numbers of Airmen and
equipment will be held to an absolute minimum when officials entitled to such
honors visit military installations. In general, full honors are reserved for
statutory appointees and general or flag officers of the military Services,
foreign dignitaries, and occasions when ceremonies promote international good
will. The installation commander determines which types of honors are rendered.
Enlisted personnel are frequently appointed as project NCOs for ceremonies,
officials at social events, or escorts for visiting DVs. </p>

<p class="msonormal140"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.16.2.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span>Project NCOs represent their organization or
their base and are responsible for assisting DVs. A smooth visit requires
planning before the visit. Review AFI 34-1201 and AFPAM 34-1202 for further
guidance on responsibilities and proper procedures.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Contact guests beforehand to find out if they desire special
arrangements. The base protocol office may also need to know guests’
transportation needs. Other duties may include preregistering guests, meeting
them upon arrival, and escorting them to their next destination. </p>

<p class="msonormal141"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.16.3.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span>Place a tentative itinerary and welcome package
in the guest quarters. Include such items as a recent base newspaper, unit or
base history, telephone numbers of base facilities, maps of the base and local
area, and most importantly, the visit point of contact information. Also
appropriate are biographies on the installation or host commander and Command
Chief Master Sergeant, host Professional Military Education commandants and
program managers, and Chief </p>

<p class="msonormal142">Master Sergeants and first sergeants
(in the case of a senior enlisted DV, such as the Chief Master Sergeant of the
Air Force). Include instructions on operating difficult-to-use appliances or
machines, using the telephone system, and computer connection information in
the guest quarters. </p>

<p class="msonormal140"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.16.4.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span>Give a thorough <span class="calibre2">prebriefing</span>
to the guest speaker at a special function, such as a Dining-In. Guests may
have several commitments other than the primary project. If so, make sure they
have schedules that allow time for meetings, telephone calls, meals, changes of
clothes, coffee breaks, occasional rest periods, and transportation. Common
practice is to leave 2 hours between the end-of-the-day activities and the
start of evening functions. </p>

<p class="msonormal140"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.16.5.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span>Determine transportation time by physically traveling
from place to place before the schedule is set. Allow extra time for boarding
vehicles and transferring baggage or luggage. For large official parties, be
sure to brief all drivers on the schedule and give explicit directions so they
can operate independently if they become separated. Ensure they “dry run” the
routes to avoid delays due to roadwork, stoplight outages, or road closures.
Arrange the lodging checkout time and bill payment method. Arrange flight meals
if the guests are leaving by military aircraft and desire this service. Smooth
visits can make a lasting positive impression. If you run into difficulty or
have questions, do not hesitate to contact the base protocol office. </p>

<p class="msonormal140"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.16.6.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span>A DV’s visit is an important event in the
day-to-day life of an organization. Everyone wants to make a good impression
whether the visitor is a representative of Congress, foreign dignitary, or city
mayor. Problems with these visits are avoided through strict attention to
detail from the preplanning for arrival to luggage handling, dinner
arrangements, and departure plans. Remember, you never get a second chance to
make a good first impression. </p>

Information.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal143">The enlisted corps has a variety of programs to recognize
individuals for outstanding performance, achievements, contributions, and
promotions to the senior noncommissioned officer grades. AFI 36-2805, <i class="calibre3">Special Trophies and Awards</i>, provides
information on a variety of programs but is not all-inclusive. Senior
noncommissioned officers should become familiar with the induction of newly
promoted Master Sergeants into the “Top 3.” They should also become familiar
with the Order of the Sword Ceremony (reference AFI 36-2824, <i class="calibre3">Order of the Sword Programs</i>) and
retirement ceremonies. </p>

<p class="msonormal144"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.18.1.1.<span class="calibre49">
</span></span></span>The Order of the Sword is patterned after an
order of chivalry founded during the Middle Ages—the Swedish Royal Order of the
Sword. The rank of NCO was established in the early 12th century. In 1522,
Swedish King <span class="calibre2">Gustavus</span> I enjoined the noblemen commissioned
by him to appoint officers to serve him. Those appointed were accountants,
builders, crafts people, teachers, scribes, and others conducting the daily
kingdom affairs. The system worked so well it was incorporated into the Swedish
Army as a way to establish and maintain a cohesive, disciplined, and
well-trained force. This force ensured the protection of lives and property in
the kingdom. </p>

<p class="msonormal145"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.18.1.2.<span class="calibre49"> </span></span></span>Ancient
NCOs would honor their leader and pledge their loyalty by ceremoniously
presenting him with a sword. The sword—a symbol of truth, justice, and power
rightfully used—served as a token for all to see and know that here was a
“leader among leaders.” The ceremony became known as The Royal Order of the
Sword. The first recorded use in the U.S. was in the 1860s when General Robert
E. Lee was presented a sword by his command. </p>

<p class="msonormal114"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.18.2.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">The
Current Ceremony.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal146">The Royal Order of the Sword ceremony
was revised, updated, and adopted by Air Force NCOs in 1967. The Order of the
Sword was established by the Air Force enlisted force to recognize and honor
military senior officers, colonel or above, and civilian equivalents, for
conspicuous and significant contributions to the welfare and prestige of the
Air Force enlisted force mission effectiveness as well as the overall military
establishment.<span class="calibre83"> </span>The Order of the Sword is the highest honor and
tribute NCOs can bestow upon an individual.<span class="calibre83"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal114"><span class="calibre48"><span class="calibre2">8.18.3.<span class="calibre49"> 
</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Approved
Swords.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal28">The only approved swords are at the Air Force
level (Air Force Sword) and major command level (Major Command Sword). The Air
Force Sword is reserved for those deserving senior leaders who serve outside
the major command structure. The Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
maintains the Air Force Sword. The Major commands maintain the Major Command
Swords and ensure they are reserved for those deserving senior leaders who
serve or have served within the awarding major command.<span class="calibre83"> </span>Each major command
establishes additional guidelines not already covered in AFI 36-2824. An Order
of the Sword executive committee is responsible for developing guidelines,
nomination procedures, approval or disapproval of any nominations submitted,
and protocol of the induction ceremony. The committee must also approve the
nomination. The Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force or major command’s
Command Chief Master Sergeant (depending on level of award), is known as the
“keeper of the sword,” and usually chairs the committee. </p>

</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Nomination
and Selection.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal9">NCOs wishing to nominate a qualified officer
or civilian for induction into the Order of the Sword should contact their
Command Chief Master Sergeant and refer to AFI 36-2824 for processing
procedures. (<b class="calibre1">Note: </b>Do not inform the
nominee of the possible induction.) The nomination folder should include a
cover memorandum, biographical sketch, and brief justification. Ensure the
nomination is thorough enough so the committee can carefully weigh the
individual’s merits. The Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force or major
command Chief Master Sergeant (depending on level of award) informs the
nominating organization of the decision and provides appropriate guidance and
procedures as necessary. </p>

</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Preparation
for the Ceremony.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal18">Once the nomination is approved, a
ceremony committee will form and begin planning the ceremony. Preparations
required for the Order of the Sword ceremony are similar to those for the
Dining-In discussed in this chapter. Host NCOs are responsible for planning,
executing, and paying for the ceremony. This includes the dinner, awards and
presentations to be made to the honoree, ceremonial equipment (such as
individual swords), and printed proclamations. </p>

</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Induction
Ceremony. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">This evening affair usually consists of a
social period, formal dinner, and induction ceremony. The required dress is the
mess dress or semiformal uniform. The ceremony should be well rehearsed to
reflect formality, dignity, and prestige. Four key participants have speaking
parts and other duties: the Chief Master Sergeant of the mess,<span class="calibre83"> </span>first
sergeant, duty sergeant, and sergeant at arms. Major command directives provide
specific guidance for NCOs serving in these positions. </p>

</span></span></span><b class="calibre1">Permanent
Recognition in the Order of the Sword.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">The Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
maintains the official list of Order of the Sword recipients. Each sponsoring
command maintains a master sword designed for their ceremonies. This sword is
on display at each command’s headquarters. A nameplate commemorating the
command’s inductions is affixed to its command master sword. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">8.19. Conclusion.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal18">Military customs and courtesies are
proven traditions, acts of respect and courtesy, and signs of the mutual
respect and fraternity that exist among military personnel. Military customs
and courtesies play an extremely important role in building morale, esprit de
corps, discipline, and mission effectiveness. This chapter outlines customs and
courtesies, providing an extensive but not all-inclusive outline of what makes
the Air Force and the people special. These ceremonies represent many customs
and traditions of our Air Force heritage. They are very real aspects of life,
and, in the aggregate, form the special culture and lifestyle uniquely
characteristic of the military profession. This guidance is offered to empower
you with the knowledge that can add comfort to your daily social interactions.
Apply using common sense. The guidelines in this chapter can help avoid
protocol pitfalls. </p>

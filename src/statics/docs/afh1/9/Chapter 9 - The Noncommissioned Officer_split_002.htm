<p class="msonormal58">9.5.3.4.10. <b class="calibre1">CMSAF Gary R. Pfingston: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal59"><img src="image013.png" hspace="15" class="calibre9"/>9.5.3.4.10.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Gary R. Pfingston played minor league
baseball before enlisting in the Air Force as an aircraft mechanic. During his
first assignment as a B-52 crew chief at Castle Air Force Base, California, he
went to work one day with a pack of cigarettes and $2, and did not return home
for 30 days because the Cuban Missile Crisis sent the base into lockdown. Ten
years later, Pfingston worked aircraft maintenance in Thailand, reconfiguring 
B-52s to carry conventional bombs in what became known as “iron belly”
modifications. In 1973, he returned to the states and spent the next 8 1/2
years as a military training instructor, and later, chief of the military
training division. During an assignment to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam,
Pfingston broke his back, was hospitalized for 147 days, and returned to duty
as the first sergeant. Future assignments had Pfingston taking part in the
first ability to survive and operate exercise in a chemical environment and
serving as a senior enlisted advisor. </p>

<p class="msonormal60">9.5.3.4.10.2. CMSAF Pfingston’s
focus during his tenure was the Air Force drawdown and budget. Holding the
highest enlisted position during Desert Storm, he worked to restore basic
allowance for subsistence to the troops living in field </p>

<p class="msonormal61">conditions and increasing the Servicemember’s Group
Life Insurance, but the toughest challenge he faced was the Air Force
downsizing. To avoid involuntary separations, Pfingston worked to implement the
Voluntary Separation Incentive and Special Separation Bonus Programs. His idea
to provide career paths and milestones in line with the officer career model,
led to the career field education and training plan, three-level and
seven-level technical schools for all career fields, and mandatory in-residence
PME schools. He also found himself involved with issues such as homosexuals
serving in the military, Air Force specialty codes opening up to women,
assignment policies including the Enlisted Quarterly Assignments Listing
(EQUAL) and EQUAL-Plus, and even the introduction of the new senior NCO stripes.
Pfingston remained active in what he called the “communication chain” of former
CMSAFs advocating for the enlisted force after his retirement. CMSAF Pfingston
died in 2007.<span class="calibre19"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal58">9.5.3.4.11. <b class="calibre1">CMSAF David J. Campanale: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal62"><img src="image014.png" hspace="15" class="calibre20"/>9.5.3.4.11.1. Worcester, Massachusetts, native David J.
Campanale said he had the world by the throat after high school. A promising
athlete, when a baseball career fell through, his mother encouraged him to join
the Air Force in 1970. Campanale completed aircraft maintenance technical
school despite poor study habits and breaking his collarbone playing football.
He credits his supervisors at his first base with turning his attitude around.
Campanale sought challenges, volunteering for several tours to Andersen Air
Force Base, Guam, in support of B-52 Arc Light missions in Southeast Asia. He
later volunteered to transfer to aerial repair. As he rose through the ranks,
Campanale earned the distinguished graduate award at both the NCO academy and
senior NCO academy and was stripes for exceptional performer-promoted to Master
Sergeant. He later served as a senior enlisted advisor, a role called “richly
rewarding.” </p>

<p class="msonormal63">9.5.3.4.11.2. The year CMSAF
Campanale began his tour, the military launched the new TRICARE health program.
The change introduced many questions and a great deal of anxiety. He led the
charge to alleviate those feelings through education. Also, when Congress
threatened to change the retirement system to “High One” effectively reducing
retirement pay, Campanale quickly responded. </p>

<p class="msonormal64">With senior leader support, Campanale stood before
Congress in the successful fight against the proposed change. Another important
recruitment and retention milestone was adoption of the one-plus-one dormitory
standard, which gave each Airman his or her own room. Not a proponent of long
speeches, while visiting bases he encouraged questions rather than delivering a
speech, which created meaningful dialogue. He believes anyone can become CMSAF
and offers those who want to follow in his footsteps this piece of advice: Be
honest and keep your promise. Campanale continues to actively mentor Airmen
serving today. </p>

<p class="msonormal58">9.5.3.4.12. <b class="calibre1">CMSAF Eric W. Benken: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal67"><img src="image015.png" hspace="15" class="calibre11"/>9.5.3.4.12.1. Raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, after graduating
high school Eric W. Benken moved to Houston, Texas, to join his parents.
Struggling to find a good paying job out of the area, he joined the Air Force
as an administrative specialist. Although first assigned to Ellington Air Force
Base, Texas (less than 25 miles from </p>

<p class="msonormal68">Houston), he would get his chance to travel 9 months
later, on orders to Ching Chuan Kang Air Base, Taiwan. During his tour, he
deployed to South Vietnam, where he spent his 20th birthday. As the United
States Air Forces Europe senior enlisted advisor, he facilitated the highly
successful beddown of forces during the Bosnia Operation Joint Endeavor. He led
numerous quality-of-life initiatives, including eliminating/remodeling a third of
the United States Air Forces Europe zero-privacy dormitories, making way for
the newly developed one-plus-one dormitories. During his assignment, Benken
crafted the NCO Professional Development Seminar, an effort to fill the career
education void between Airman Leadership School and the NCO academy. </p>

<p class="msonormal69">9.5.3.4.12.2. During his tenure as
CMSAF, he focused heavily on fundamental discipline, getting back to basics,
and changing the culture of the Air Force to meet </p>

<p class="msonormal61">new expeditionary requirements. He championed Warrior
Week at basic training and ensured funding for a simulated deployed location at
Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. He instituted changes in the First Sergeant
Academy curriculum, focusing on deployment responsibilities. He believed
changing the title “senior enlisted advisor” to “Command Chief Master Sergeant”
and adding the star to the chevron were critical to the success of these
positions, in garrison and on the battlefield. CMSAF Benken engaged Congress
and special interest groups on numerous fronts, ultimately defeating attempts
to alter basic military training gender-integrated training, and reversing the
diminished retirement system of 1986. Other significant challenges included
ensuring TRICARE met health care needs, and modernizing the force with a
limited budget. He believed Air Force leaders should focus on the future and
take steps to prepare the force for the next century. Benken served as the
first co-chair of the Air Force Retiree Council, currently serves on the board
of directors for the Airmen Memorial Foundation and the Mission Readiness
Organization Executive Advisory Council, and continues to speak at a variety of
Air Force functions. </p>

<p class="msonormal70">9.5.3.4.13. <b class="calibre1">CMSAF Jim Finch: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal71">9.5.3.4.13.1. Jim Finch entered the Air Force from
East Hampton, New York, expecting to do only a 4-year hitch. He planned to
learn a trade and see what the world had to offer and move on. Finch spent the
early part of his career in the “bomb dumps” as a missile maintenance crew
chief before becoming a PME instructor. After 4 years of teaching, Finch moved
to the Leadership and Management Development Center at Maxwell Air Force Base
Alabama. While there, he helped develop a correspondence version of the NCO
preparatory course, and taught new PME instructors. He was subsequently
selected as the Air Force NCO PME functional manager at the Air Force Military
Personnel Center. While there, he was involved in restructuring the PME program
from four to three levels and implementing procedures to create Airman
Leadership School and allow Master Sergeants to attend the senior NCO academy.
Finch later served as an NCO Academy commandant, the 11th Air Force senior
enlisted advisor, and Air Combat </p>

<p class="msonormal73">9.5.3.4.13.2. When CMSAF Finch took the reins, the
Air Force was moving from <sup class="calibre18"> </sup><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre22"> </span></sup>a cold war to an expeditionary mindset. He
implemented CMSAF Benken’s basic training Warrior Week vision to help new
recruits understand that the expeditionary Air Force was not a temporary
concept. He credits the program’s success to the men and women at Lackland
candidates and gave commanders more selection flexibility. Known as a man of
vision, he spent 3 years focusing on enlisted members’ concerns, and
implementing programs to improve future preparedness. Finch recognized that the
armed forces had to change to meet changing threats to national security. He
believed future-focused leaders were paramount to success and made significant
contributions to ensure the force developed that kind of leader. Finch
maintains his vision for Airmen by serving on boards of Air Forceassociated
organizations, visiting Air Force members worldwide, and supporting current
CMSAF agendas. </p>

<p class="msonormal70">9.5.3.4.14. <b class="calibre1">CMSAF Gerald R. Murray: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal74"><img src="image017.png" hspace="15" class="calibre9"/>9.5.3.4.14.1. Gerald R. Murray, a native of Boiling
Springs, North Carolina, grew up on his grandfather’s farm. Graduating high
school in 1974, he briefly attended college, married his school sweetheart, and
worked in textile mills and construction before entering the Air Force as an
F-4 aircraft crew chief in 1977. Murray’s performance and capabilities were
quickly recognized by his promotion to Senior Airman below the zone, and
selection as an F-16 aircraft maintenance instructor. He continued to excel as
the senior F-16 crew chief on "Victor Alert" at Incirlik Air Base,
Turkey, and later as an A-10 squadron production superintendent. Deployed in
support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, he played a key role as
the combat turn director at the most forward operation location in theater,
garnering the Bronze Star, and later the Air Force General Lew Allen Trophy.
After standing up a new A-10 squadron at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia,
Murray’s performance and leadership were recognized again when he was pulled
from the flight line to serve as the 347th Wing Senior Enlisted Advisor and
Command Chief Master Sergeant. He later served as the command Chief Master
Sergeant at 5th Air Force, United States Forces Japan, and Pacific Air Forces
Command. </p>

<p class="msonormal73">9.5.3.4.14.2. An evolving expeditionary air force
and a changed world after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks were
catalysts for change during Murray’s tenure. Murray refocused basic military
training and PME toward expeditionary combat principles and took a leading role
in developing a new physical fitness program to improve Air Force-wide
capabilities and readiness. Additionally, Murray led efforts to balance the
enlisted force structure by increasing high-year tenure for four enlisted
grades, bringing back the career job reservation and NCO retraining programs,
and redistributing senior NCO promotions in critical and unbalanced Air Force
specialty codes. Understanding the need to maintain strong leadership, he
initiated a deliberate approach to NCO professional development; led changes to
the management of Chief Master Sergeants, including alignment under the Air
Force Senior Leaders Management Office, and added a Chief Master Sergeant’s
leadership course to the enlisted PME continuum. In retirement, Murray remains
active in shaping Airmen development, serving with Air Force professional
organizations and continuing to speak throughout the force. </p>

<p class="msonormal75">9.5.3.4.15.1. Rodney J. McKinley
grew up in Mt. Orab, Ohio, and originally entered the Air Force in 1974 as a
medical technician. He separated from the Air Force in 1977 to pursue his
education. He returned to active duty in 1982 as an aircraft maintenance
specialist and served in various aircraft maintenance positions at Myrtle Beach
Air Force Base, South Carolina, and Clark Air Base, Philippines. In 1991, he
became a first sergeant, a position he held for the next 10 years, with
assignments at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina; Ghedi Air Base,
Italy; Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma; and Ramstein Air Base, Germany. Chief
McKinley then served as a command Chief Master Sergeant at Ramstein Air Base,
Germany; Langley Air Force Base, Virginia; and 11th Air Force at Elmendorf Air </p>

<p class="msonormal76">Force Base, Alaska. In February 2003, during the
early days of Operation Iraqi Freedom, he deployed as Command Chief Master
Sergeant to the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, Southwest Asia. Before being
selected as the 15th CMSAF, he was the Pacific Air Forces Command Chief Master
Sergeant at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii. </p>

<p class="msonormal64">9.5.3.4.15.2. During his tenure, CMSAF McKinley was
an advocate for winning the Global War on Terrorism, developing and taking care
of Airmen, and modernizing aging air, space, and cyberspace assets. CMSAF
McKinley focused on properly organizing, training, and equipping Airmen during
a time when many were being tasked outside their core competencies. His efforts
to improve the enlisted evaluation system resulted in the first major changes
to feedback and performance report forms since 1990. CMSAF McKinley also
advocated for an educated enlisted corps and strongly encouraged Airmen to
pursue their Community College of the Air Force degree earlier in their
careers. A strong advocate for the “American Airman” spirit, he opened the door
for creation of the Airman’s Creed, which codified core Air Force beliefs and
articulated the warrior ethos. His vision led to the creation of the Enlisted
Heroes Walk on the parade field at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, and the
return of the enlisted collar brass and Good Conduct Medal. CMSAF McKinley also
pursued improvements in Airman health and fitness, wounded warrior care, child
care, spousal employment opportunities, and accompanied and unaccompanied
housing. </p>

served as the United States Pacific Command senior enlisted leader at Camp H.M.
Smith, Hawaii. </p>

<p class="msonormal80">9.5.3.4.16.2. Chief Roy’s key focus areas included ensuring
Airmen were ready for </p>

<p class="msonormal81">joint and coalition operations; deliberately
developing Airmen through education, training and experience; and building a
culture of resiliency within Airmen and their families. He worked to expand and
solidify training and engagement in joint and coalition environments, which
helped enhance the employability of Airmen in the increasingly joint and
coalition warfighting environment. He also stressed the importance of updating
and expanding distance-learning opportunities, and developed and promoted the
Enlisted PME-Next construct, designed to close the gap in PME following Airman
Leadership School.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

and Training Command at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas.  </p>

<p class="msonormal84">9.5.3.4.17.2. Immediately upon assuming the
position, Chief Cody committed to the continued evolution of the enlisted
force. He identified various policies and processes, and with the support of
the Air Force Chief of Staff and Enlisted Board of Directors moved each of them
forward to ensure the enlisted force was prepared for future challenges. He
focused on the deliberate development of Airmen, evolving enlisted PME to a
blended learning model, and establishing Developmental Special Duties, which
ensured top Airmen were in leadership positions that best leveraged their
proven performance across the force. He heightened the conversation surrounding
work/life balance and the importance of finding a reasonable and sustainable
demand signal for Airmen, and strengthened care and support programs for
Wounded Warriors, including Airmen with invisible wounds such as TBI and/or
PTSD. Additionally, Chief Cody moved the Enlisted Evaluation System and
Weighted Airman Promotion System forward to ensure they served today's Air
Force, and Airmen. He led the biggest changes to both systems since their
inception in 1970, ensuring job performance was the greatest factor towards
promotion. </p>

over all junior enlisted Airmen and other NCOs according to rank. Within the
same grade, use: date of rank, total active federal military service date, pay
date, and date of birth, in this order, to determine seniority. <b class="calibre1">NOTE<i class="calibre2">: </i></b>In
some circumstances NCOs who are lower in rank may be placed in charge of other
NCOs of the same grade (i.e., a Technical Sergeant, with a date of rank of 1
Apr 08, is placed in charge of a fellow Technical Sergeant, with a date of rank
of 1 Apr 07). When placed in charge by commanders, these NCOs have the

<p class="msonormal90"><b class="calibre1">9.12. Airmanship. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal122">9.12.1. Airmanship Defined. The Army has soldiers.
The Navy has sailors. The Marine Corps has marines. The Air Force has Airmen.
From the Airman Basic to the Four-Star General, we in the Air Force are all
Airmen. As Airmen, we are part of a professional subculture and we demonstrate
various disciplines in defense of our Nation through something we call Airmanship.<span class="calibre6"> </span>Airmanship is the mindset,
evident in our behaviors, that causes us to proudly exhibit the highest levels
of professional service to our country. </p>

<p class="msonormal123"><img src="image022.png" hspace="15" class="calibre24"/><b class="calibre1">Figure 9.4. Airmanship </b>9.12.1.2. What exactly is
this mindset? The dictionary defines mindset as <i class="calibre2">“a mental disposition or
attitude that predetermines one’s responses and interpretations of situations</i>.”
In the case of Airmanship, that mental disposition or attitude (mindset) is
what we think and how we feel about membership in the profession of arms, and
that mindset is reflected in our behavior. A genuine belief in the <b class="calibre1">oath of
enlistment</b>, an embracement of Air Force <b class="calibre1">core values</b> as your own,
commitment to the <b class="calibre1">profession of arms</b> and an unstoppable determination
known as <b class="calibre1">warrior ethos</b> are the hallmarks of that mindset. Such a mindset
produces pride, selfless service, and care for our country. This mindset is
what we aspire to create and sustain in order to perpetuate behaviors necessary
for mission accomplishment. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">9.12.1.3. Our behavior is a direct
result of our mindset (belief, commitment, embracement, and willingness), and
demonstrates our </p>

<p class="msonormal124">personal commitment to membership in the profession
of arms. Adherence to and enforcement of standards, the willingness to fulfill
all responsibilities, impeccable wear of the uniform, readiness to perform
mission objectives, and perpetuation of the Air Force culture provide a clear
picture of what we expect Airman behavior to look like. (See Figure 9.4). </p>

Airmen’s week is the first touch-point in career-long continuum of
professionalism development. Airmen’s Week is a stand-alone course that
commences immediately following Basic Military Training (BMT) but before Airmen
start technical training. Every Airman (including Guard &amp; Reserve)
graduating from BMT has attended Airmen’s week, which began on 23 Mar 2015.  </p>

<p class="msonormal126"> </p>

<p class="msonormal127">9.12.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Mission and Goals. </b>Airmen’s
Week equips Airmen to transition from a solid BMT foundation to the

Assistance Programs (RAP): </b></p>

<p class="msonormal130">9.13.1. The We Are All Recruiters (WEAR) Program may
grant individuals permissive temporary duty status if they participate in an
event that directly enhances the recruiting mission. All Airmen, regardless of
their Air Force specialty, are recruiters. A WEAR event is an event where the
interaction of Air Force personnel educates and increases public awareness of
the Air Force and could potentially provide numerous leads for recruiters.
Approval for WEAR is limited to those events where Airmen are directly speaking
to potential applicants or influencers about Air Force opportunities.
Applicants are defined as individuals within the 17- to 39-year-old range; and
influencers are defined as parents, community leaders, teachers, counselors,
coaches, etc. WEAR events are approved on an individual basis. For those events
where multiple Airmen are attending, each attendee must submit a package for
approval. WEAR requests must be first approved by the individual’s commander in
accordance with AFI 36-3003, <i class="calibre2">Military Leave Program.</i> Requests are then
routed through Air Force Recruiting Squadron Public Affairs to the Air Force
Recruiting Squadron commander. The Air Force Recruiting Squadron commander is
the approval authority for all WEAR packages. Members may receive up to 14 days
permissive TDY to attend a WEAR event. For more information, see AFI 36-3003,

9D—Military Ethics </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal90"><b class="calibre1">9.16. Introduction. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal130">Military ethics is about each Airman doing what is
right and just for our country, Air Force, and unit. Our Air Force, driven
towards excellence by competence and character, is built upon thousands of good
Americans that have volunteered to defend our country. These Airman realize truth
and integrity are more than buzz words; those words are the focal point of our
moral compass. As General John D. Ryan, the 16th Air Force Chief of Staff, said
"any order to compromise integrity is not a lawful order." Airmen
must have the courage to be the type of people we ought to be. Ethical Airmen
are not focused on personal successes or virtues. </p>

<p class="msonormal141">9.16.1. As an Airman serving proudly in the
Profession of Arms, you definitely know the difference between right and wrong.
The Air Force provides guiding rules and standards through an ethical code. An
ethical code guides us in our daily decision making. Our ethical code is
prescribed throughout our Air Force Core Values, Oath of Enlistment, Oath of
Office, Air Force Instructions, and the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
You’ll be faced with decisions. Some decisions you will have to make. Other
decisions you will help your wingmen make. These decisions might be related to
your mission, your personal life, or the interest of your peers. The choice you
make can be successful when you’re utilizing sound ethical principles. </p>

<p class="msonormal137">9.16.1.1. Sound ethical principles are rooted in our
Air Force Core Values. Our core values of Integrity First, Service Before Self,
and Excellence In All We Do clearly define our identity. Every Airman learns to
cherish our core values when they enter our profession. They begin by reading
the core values, then understanding the core values, and finally living the
core values. Expanding upon our core values lead us to virtues we must practice
and demonstrate in our lives. </p>

<p class="msonormal64">9.16.1.2. Integrity First is a character trait and
the willingness to do what is right even when no one is looking.  Integrity is
your moral compass and inner voice of self-control. The virtues of honesty,
courage, and accountability stem from Integrity First. Honesty means our words
must be unquestionable so we preserve the trust that unites us through common
goal and purpose. Courage is about doing the right thing despite fear and
empowers us to make ourselves better. Accountability instills our responsibility
while maintaining transparency and ownership for our actions. </p>

<p class="msonormal64">9.16.1.3. Service Before Self tells us professional
duties take precedence over personal desires. The virtues of duty, loyalty, and
respect blossom from Service Before Self. Duty is our obligation to perform
what is required for the mission; sometimes having to make sacrifices in ways
that no other profession has or will. Loyalty is our internal commitment to the
success and preservation of something bigger than ourselves, ordered as country,
Air Force, and unit. Respect requires us to treat each other with dignity and
value them as individuals, knowing all Airmen possess fundamental worth as
human beings. </p>

<p class="msonormal61">9.16.1.4. Excellence In All We Do directs us to
develop a sustained passion for the continuous improvement and innovation that
propels the Air Force, as well as ourselves, beyond the capabilities of our
adversaries. The virtues of mission, discipline, and teamwork are the
cornerstone of Excellence In All We Do. Mission encompasses operations,
product, and resource excellence; must accomplish our duties correctly while
practicing fiscal responsibility. Discipline is an individual commitment to
uphold the highest standards of personal and professional conduct, which we
demonstrate with attitude, work ethic, and continuous improvement. Required is
teamwork at every level to complete the mission and we must recognize the
interdependency of each Airmen’s contribution toward the mission and strive for
organizational excellence. </p>

<p class="msonormal97">9.16.1.5. An ethical dilemma is a situation where
one is forced to choose between at least two alternatives. Three general causes
of ethical dilemmas are uncertainty, competing values, and potential harm.
Uncertainty is the result of not having all the facts pertaining to the
situation, having no experience dealing with the situation, or not having a
clearly established policy, procedure, or rule for deciding how to choose.
Competing values occur when our personal values conflict with those of our
institution, subordinates, peers, or supervisors; however, the mark of a true
professional is maintaining high professional standards despite conflicting
values. Potential harm relates to the intentional and unintentional
consequences caused by your actions; you should always think through second and
third order consequences of your actions. When facing an ethical dilemma, Dr.
James H. Toner provides us the framework of ethical principles for decision
making. </p>

<p class="msonormal142">9.16.2. According to Dr. James H. Toner, former Professor
of International Relations and Military Ethics, Air War College, military
ethics is rooted in the three Os: <i class="calibre2">owing,</i> <i class="calibre2">ordering</i>, and <i class="calibre2">oughting</i>.
</p>

<p class="msonormal137">9.16.2.1. Military ethics cannot properly exist
without the concept of owing. If we, as Airmen, know who and why we owe, we are
able to recognize the obligation, responsibility, and duty which give rise to
moral thinking and ethical reasoning. Airmen must understand they owe a debt of
gratitude to our country, family, service, chain of command, and comrades.
Additionally, from the pioneers of aviation to the selfless sacrifice of
battlefield Airmen, we owe to those who came before us and those we serve with
today to strive for “excellence in all we do”.  Furthermore, this is a
reflection of the core value “service before self” as identified in the
Airman’s Creed: <i class="calibre2">I am faithful to a proud heritage, a tradition of honor, and
a legacy of valor</i>.  </p>

<p class="msonormal137">9.16.2.2. The second O is for ordering, or what Dr.
Toner calls moral structuring and ethical priorities. In other words, are you
putting your priorities in the right order? Many illegal activities or easily
prevented mistakes are the result of a leader’s failure to order<i class="calibre2"> </i>wisely
and well. As defenders of freedom and justice, we take an oath to defend the
Constitution of the United States, and to obey the President and the officers
appointed over us, in that order. As Airmen, our highest priority is to serve
our country. We can never sacrifice the good of our nation for the good of our
service, our superiors, or ourselves. According to Dr. Toner, the proper
ordering of our priorities should be country, Air Force, and then unit. Dr.
Toner explains that to understand this concept, look at the service tape on
your uniform and notice the United States always comes before Air Force. We
pronounce the same when we recite our Airman’s Creed: <i class="calibre2">I am an American
Airman, I am a warrior, I have answered my nation’s call.</i> </p>

<p class="msonormal64">9.16.2.3. The final O, oughting, is the
understanding of what Airmen ought to do every day. What Airmen do may not be
what they ought to do and this may sound simple, but military hierarchies
insist upon obedience to orders and total discipline. Ethics, however, objects
to this, insisting upon conditional and contextual obedience to orders, which
ought to be obeyed, if lawful. The <i class="calibre2">Manual for Courts-Martial</i>, Rule 916,
states “It is a defense to any offense that the accused was acting pursuant to
orders unless the accused knew the orders to be unlawful or a person of
ordinary sense and understanding would have known the orders to be unlawful.”
Our core values help guide us in the direction of what we ought to do. </p>

<p class="msonormal142">9.16.3. To support our concept of ordering, we are
introduced to the three Ps: <i class="calibre2">principle</i>, <i class="calibre2">purpose</i>, and <i class="calibre2">people</i>.  
</p>

<p class="msonormal143">9.16.3.1. Our principle, which is truth telling and honorable
service, is always first. Truth telling goes hand in hand with our core value
of “integrity first”, which is the foundation of trust. Trust unites us as
Airmen and permits you to grow a strong wingman bond. Honorable service is
detailed in the Code of Conduct, which in and of itself is an ethical guide.
Just ask Captain Scott F. O’Grady, who was shot down behind enemy lines. </p>

<p class="msonormal61">9.16.3.2. Our purpose as Airmen, clearly defined as
mission accomplishment and duty, is why our service exists.  From hot air
balloons to wooden propellers to turbofan engines, Airmen have risen to the
challenge at hand. We are the Tuskegee Airmen that never let an escorted bomber
get shot down. We are the liberators of the oppressed as evidenced in Operation
Desert Storm. We are the future of advanced warfare which we proudly proclaim
in the Airman’s Creed:<i class="calibre2"> I am an American, My mission is to fly, fight, and
win.</i> </p>

<p class="msonormal61">9.16.3.3. Our people make all of this possible. Just
look to the walls of the Enlisted Heritage Research Institute to see this is
true. Staff Sergeant William H. Pitsenbarger gave his life aiding and defending
a unit of soldiers pinned down by an enemy assault. Sergeant John L. Levitow
disregarded his own wounds and saved the lives of his entire crew. Senior
Airman Jason D. Cunningham gave his life so that others may live. Airman First
Class Elizabeth N. Jacobson made the ultimate sacrifice while guarding a convoy
of American service men and women. These heroic Airmen personified this passage
from the Airman’s Creed: <i class="calibre2">I am an American Airman, guardian of freedom and
justice, my nation’s sword and shield, its sentry and avenger, I defend my
country with my life.</i> </p>

<p class="msonormal144">9.16.4. To assist our decision making, we incorporate the
three Rs: <i class="calibre2">rules</i>,<i class="calibre2"> results</i>, and <i class="calibre2">realities</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal97">9.16.4.1. First, obey the rules because the rules
are the accepted moral norms. However, we can’t create rules for every possible
situation. When facing an ethical dilemma and asking yourself “What ought I
do?” reflect on the core values to idealize the person we want to be and the
example we want to set.  </p>

<p class="msonormal134">9.16.4.2. Additionally, results are the goals of
country, Air Force, and unit and our responsibility as Airmen is to accomplish
the mission. However, in the climate of decentralized execution, our
responsibility is to figure out how to accomplish the mission. Do not make
decisions based on self-interests.  </p>

<p class="msonormal64">9.16.4.3. Finally, realities are inputs that effect
our decision-making. We must use our self-awareness to realize who we are and
what we do; because, what we do is who we are and who we are is what we do. If
your moral compass needs calibration, your decision will not direct you on the
right path. When your moral compass is well maintained, you will guide your
country, Air Force, and unit upon a righteous path. </p>

<p class="msonormal142">9.16.5. To put the three Os into action, we utilize the
three Ds: <i class="calibre2">discern</i>, <i class="calibre2">declare</i>, and <i class="calibre2">do</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal98">9.16.5.1. We must discern, or recognize, the correct path
to lead our Airmen on. Attentive wingmen utilize critical thinking to discern.
Remember to properly <i class="calibre2">order</i> your thinking. </p>

<p class="msonormal98">9.16.5.2. We must declare the correct path as we have
discerned the correct path. Effective leaders educate and promote the growth of
their team. Your inclusion of team members will enhance the change process. </p>

<p class="msonormal134">9.16.5.3. Then we must do what we have discerned and
declared. Spirited warriors accomplish the mission. We speak these truths when
reciting the Airman’s Creed: <i class="calibre2">I am an American Airman, wingman, leader,
warrior, I will never leave an Airman behind, I will never falter, and I will
not fail.<b class="calibre1"> </b></i></p>

<p class="msonormal122">9.16.6. As Airmen, we owe those who wore the uniform
before us. We are free today because others sacrificed their time, effort, and
lives to make our country what our country is, and we must continue the fight
to ensure our country stays strong and secure. We must also order<i class="calibre2"> </i>our
priorities so we are able to overcome any temptation to stray from our military
norms and values. Finally, we should always do what we ought<i class="calibre2"> </i>to do. </p>

<p class="msonormal145">9.16.6.1. When contemplating what to do, considering
your possible courses of action is important. By listing your possible
decisions that could correct the situation, you can quality check your ideas to
take the most moral path. Put each of your courses of action to the test. Dr.
Robert M. Hicks, former Deputy Director of the Civil Air Patrol, Chaplain
Services, identified three tests we can use to check the morality of our
actions. </p>

<p class="msonormal146">9.16.6.2. The network test consists of asking
yourself, “How would this decision look when aired on the news?” If your
actions were broadcast on the evening news, would you be proud of your actions
or ashamed of your actions?  Would your actions discredit yourself or those we
owe? If you find the answer to be the latter, then your decision doesn’t pass
the network test. </p>

<p class="msonormal147">9.16.6.3. The United States of America test focuses
on asking yourself, “Is this decision good for America? Is this decision good
for the United States Air Force? Is this decision good for my unit? Is this
decision good for me?” If you take this course of action, are you properly
ordering your priorities? Would your actions promote the virtues of Service
Before Self (duty, loyalty, and respect)? If you can’t answer this with a
resounding yes, this might not be the best decision. </p>

<p class="msonormal64">9.16.6.4. The divine test deals with asking
yourself, “Would I feel good about the decision when I give account for my
life?” When telling the story of your proud and honorable service to our
country, would you include conversation about this decision? Would you feel
guilt or loss of trust from this action? If you can’t answer this with a
positive input, the course of action fails the divine test. </p>

<p class="msonormal134">9.16.6.5. Utilizing the information provided to you
should provide you with a clear path of understanding on how to make ethical
decisions. What is important to keep your focus on are two main areas of
honorable service: your commitment to the Profession of Arms and your ability
to make ethical choices. You can build your own ethical knowledge while
fostering that of your peers. Remind yourself and your peers of the reason you
do what you do, as found in the Oath of Enlistment or Oath of Office. Declare
the importance of adhering to established ethical codes, relying on them when
faced with a choice between right and wrong. Use Dr. Toner’s model and Dr.
Hicks’ three tests when making ethical choices. </p>

<p class="msonormal148">9.16.7. Military ethics is not about others, but is about <i class="calibre2">you</i>
knowing what is true and doing what is right; about being the man or woman who
leads the kind of life <i class="calibre2">you</i> can be proud of. </p>

<p class="msonormal131"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section
9E—Enlisted Force Development </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal90"><b class="calibre1">9.17. Introduction. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal130">Enlisted Force Development is a life-cycle approach
to developing innovative Airmen prepared to accomplish the Air Force mission
and lead in a rapidly evolving global environment while attempting to meet both
personal and professional needs. Deliberate development is essential throughout
an Airman’s career and satisfied through education on institutional
competencies, training on functional competencies, a varied array of
experiential opportunities, and force developmental tools. When developing
Airmen, what is essential is to ensure they take full advantage of the abundant
opportunities and resources that exist both functionally and institutionally.
What is imperative from an enterprise perspective, is to look at how Airmen
progress through their career fields and then into operational and strategic
leadership positions. </p>

<p class="msonormal149">9.17.1. Functionally, the Air Force develops
technical experts through career field progression and succession planning.
From the earliest stages of their careers, Airmen and their supervisors must
comprehend the progression path for technical and professional development. In
the majority of career fields, the progression roadmap and developmental
pyramid provide sufficient direction to produce Airmen qualified for their
current duties and for future responsibilities. Incumbent upon Career Field
Managers is to routinely review their progression strategy to ensure their
career field’s technical requirements are being satisfied. </p>

<p class="msonormal150">9.17.2. Institutionally, we strive to develop
experienced leaders. As Airmen demonstrate expertise and potential, they should
be encouraged to take on more responsibility and increased leadership roles.
Developmental opportunities such as deployments, joint assignments and
headquarters staff assignments offer a unique perspective on how the Air Force
functions. Furthermore, special duty assignments provide skills and insight
beneficial to an Airman’s future capabilities. </p>

<p class="msonormal149">9.17.3. Additionally, educational opportunities
exist throughout an Airman’s career which contribute to individual overall
development. Enlisted Professional Military Education, developmental education,
civilian education and other selfimprovement programs such as the United States
Air Force Library Digital Media Program and Air Force Credentialing Opportunities
On-Line enhance the knowledge and capabilities of Airmen. </p>

<p class="msonormal130">9.17.4. Effective career progression and Airman
Development are dependent upon frank conversations between supervisors and
subordinates regarding career field and institutional requirements, personal
qualifications and goals, and available developmental opportunities. Routine
counseling and performance feedback sessions should include these discussions. </p>

<p class="msonormal90"><b class="calibre1">9.18. Enlisted Force Development Oversight:<i class="calibre2"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal135">9.18.1.<b class="calibre1"> The Enlisted Force Development Panel. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal151">The Enlisted Force Development Panel is responsible
for guiding enlisted force development initiatives. The Enlisted Force
Development Panel is charged to review, evaluate, and make recommendations to
senior Air Force leaders regarding concerns, programs and initiatives relating
to the education, training and experiences impacting enlisted Airman
Development. The Enlisted Force Development Panel is hosted by the Chief,
Enlisted Force Development and co-chaired by the Chief Master Sergeant of the
Air Force and the Director, Force Development (Air Force/A1D). Panel members
include Command Chief Master Sergeants from the combatant command and major
command level as well as from the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air
National Guard. Additionally, there are Career Field Managers and
representatives from Air Education Training Command, Air University, Second Air
Force, Basic Military Training, Air Force Personnel Center and Headquarters Air
Force. A former Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force attends as a strategic
advisor. </p>

<p class="msonormal90"><b class="calibre1">9.19. Enlisted Force Development Tools. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal136">In 2010, the Enlisted Force Development Panel
recommended initiating Enlisted Development Teams to enable the enlisted force
to deliberately develop senior enlisted leaders. According to Chief Master
Sergeant of the Air Force James A. Roy, "The purpose of deliberate
development is to grow our senior noncommissioned officers and grow the next
generation of senior enlisted leaders to meet the highly technical and very
complex leadership challenges the Department of Defense and the United States
Air Force face in the future."<span class="calibre27"> </span>In 2011, pilot Enlisted
Development Teams were established in eight career fields, focusing on
specialties associated with the nuclear enterprise. In 2012, Air Force/A1 and
the Vice Chief of Staff approved Enlisted Development Teams for all Air Force
specialty codes, with execution across the enlisted force expected to be
complete by 2017. Enlisted Development Teams are designed to leverage the
development of qualified Airmen with the leadership capacity and acculturation
necessary to support current and projected mission requirements. Career Field
Managers use Enlisted Development Teams to perform progression and succession
planning to place Airmen in key leadership and developmental positions based on
defined education, training, experience and performance requirements. Placing
“the right people in the right place at the right time” is imperative. </p>

<p class="msonormal135">9.19.1.<b class="calibre1"> MyVECTOR. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal134">Formerly known as the Career Path Tool, MyVECTOR is
a Total Force, force development, experience tracking, enterprise solution that
supports the Secretary of the Air Force and Chief of Staff of the Air Force
development priorities. MyVECTOR is a web-based career planning and force
development tool which allows individuals greater transparency into their
development and career management. In addition to being the enterprise
information technology tool used to support Career Field Managers and
development teams, MyVECTOR also offers robust mentoring capabilities. The
reconfigured online platform has a modern look and feel, with the new
configuration supporting not only the traditional by-name request method of
requesting a mentor, but also providing a mentormatching capability based on
weighted characteristics identified by the Airman searching for a mentor.
MyVECTOR also has a real-time Mentoring Plan, discussion forums, a bullet
tracker to document accomplishments, and the ability to dialogue on-line with your
mentor. A resource page is also available to assist both parties with mentoring
questions and relationships. </p>

<p class="msonormal135">9.19.2.<b class="calibre1"> Enlisted Career Path Pyramid. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal143">The Enlisted Career Pyramid (Figure 9.5) is a display of
training, education, and experience which enlisted Airmen will encounter
throughout their career. This career path pyramid provides Airmen with an
understanding of current and future opportunities for continuing development.  </p>

<p class="msonormal152"><b class="calibre1">Figure 9.5. The Enlisted Career Path </b></p>

<p class="msonormal154"> </p>

<p class="msonormal155"><b class="calibre1">9.20. Institutional Competencies. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal156">Institutional competencies prepare
Airmen to operate successfully across the widest array of Air Force tasks and
requirements. These competencies provide a common language and a set of
priorities for consistency across the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal122">The Air Force‘s institutional competencies are key
to ensuring the ability of Airmen to operate successfully in a constantly
changing operational environment. They are broadly applicable and span all
occupations, functions, and organizational levels. These competencies place the
institutional responsibilities into a context of how the individual should be
developed and form the framework for force development in the Air Force. The
institutional competency list consists of 8 competencies and 25
sub-competencies. They are grouped into three categories: personal,
people/team, and organizational. 9.20.1.<b class="calibre1"> Personal Competencies.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal157">Personal competencies (Figure 9.6) are those
institutional competencies leaders need in face-to-face and interpersonal
relationships that directly influence human behavior and values. These are
foundational institutional competencies learned at the tactical level that will
continue to play a critical role as leaders move to the operational competence
and strategic vision levels. Personal competencies are essential for individual
contribution, for building cohesive units and for empowering immediate
subordinates. Each competency below is followed by the relevant subcompetencies
with definitions. </p>

<p class="msonormal135">9.20.3. <b class="calibre1">Organizational Competencies. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal190">These competencies (Figure 9.8)
represent those applicable at all levels of the Air Force but are most in
demand at the strategic level. Strategic leaders apply organizational
competencies to establish structure and articulate strategic vision. Effective
organizational competency skills include technical competence on force
structure and integration; on unified, joint, multinational, and interagency
operations; on resource allocation; and on management of complex systems. In
addition, they apply to conceptual competence in creating policy and vision and
interpersonal skills emphasizing consensus building and influencing peers and
other policy makers, both internal and external to the organization. This level
is the nexus of warfighting leadership skills for the Air Force. Also, this
level is achieved through having learned the lessons from the other types of
institutional competencies (i.e., personal and people/team). Each competency
below is followed by the relevant subcompetencies that define definitions. </p>

to achieve strategic, operational, and tactical objectives unhindered by time,
distance, or geography. The Air Force’s mission is to “deliver sovereign
options for the defense of the United States of America and global interests<b class="calibre1">—</b>to
fly and fight in Air, Space, and Cyberspace.” Thereby, jointly with our
brothers and sisters in arms—Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen—we
underwrite the strategy of defending the homeland and assuring allies, while
dissuading, deterring, and defeating enemies. </p>

<p class="msonormal222"><b class="calibre1">9.22. Professionalism or Profession of Arms.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal142">No profession asks more of their members than the
Profession of Arms. We are warriors, we have answered our Nation’s call; no one
puts more on the line to defend freedom than the men and women of the United
States Armed Forces. </p>

<p class="msonormal223"><i class="calibre2">As members of
the joint team, we Airmen are part of a unique profession that is founded on
the premise of service before self. We are not engaged in just another job; we
are practitioners of the profession of arms. We are entrusted with the security
of our Nation, the protection of our citizens, and the preservation of its way
of life. In this capacity, we serve as guardians of America’s future. By its
very nature, this responsibility requires us to place the needs of our service
and our country before personal concerns. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal224"><i class="calibre2">Our military
profession is sharply distinguished from others by what General Sir John
Hackett has termed the “unlimited liability clause.” Upon entering the Air
Force, we accept a sacred trust from the American people. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal225"><i class="calibre2">We swear to
support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,
foreign and domestic. We take this obligation freely without any reservations.
We thereby commit our lives in defense of America and her citizens should that
become necessary. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal226"><i class="calibre2">No other
profession readily expects its members to lay down their lives for their
friends, families, or freedoms. But our profession readily expects its members
to willingly risk their lives in performing their professional duties. By
voluntarily serving in the military profession, we accept unique
responsibilities.  </i></p>

<p class="msonormal227"><i class="calibre2">Inherent in all
this is the individual’s willingness to subordinate personal interests for the
good of one’s unit, one’s Service, and one’s Nation. We can ill afford
individuals who become “sunshine soldiers” or get focused on careerism.
Instead, we need professionals who strive to be the best at their current job
and who realize they attain individual advancement through the success of their
unit or work center. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal228">General Ronald R. Fogleman Former Air Force Chief of
Staff   </p>

<p class="msonormal90"><b class="calibre1">9.23. The Airman’s Perspective:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal229">9.23.1. Throughout our history, the Air Force has
always had a perspective or mindset different than the surface components of
national military power, and this is based on a long history of lessons learned
in peace and war. Specifically, airpower in application is fundamentally
different from other forms of military power. Second, inherent flexibility
allows the force to be applied independently or in concert with other forms of
military power. Third, can be most effective if applied for the right reasons
and in the right concentrations at the right time and place to achieve effects
on the battlefield. Therefore, since Air Force forces are employed differently,
in different mediums, at different speeds and closure rates and over greater
distances. These forces must be applied by those who truly appreciate the
breadth and scope in the application of that power. Finally, Airman should have
fluent knowledge of these aspects of Air Force capabilities. </p>

<p class="msonormal141">9.23.2. Airmen are essential to the Air Force
institution and the successful execution of their mission. To understand and
actively advocate the Airman’s perspective on the use of airpower to achieve
objectives as directed by proper authority is important. All Airmen share the
same goal—to accomplish their organization’s mission. In order to defend the
United States and global interests, Airmen should be prepared to fly and fight
in air, space, and cyberspace. Using the Airman’s perspective gives Airmen a distinctive
advantage when performing this mission of the Air Force. Airmen bring not only
knowledge, skills, and abilities that allow them to accomplish this mission,
but a manner of approaching mission accomplishment unique to those educated,
trained, and experienced in bringing airmindedness to all actions they perform.
An Airman brings a perspective to performing the Service’s mission that
compounds his or her effectiveness in a manner best suited to support a
commander. </p>

<p class="msonormal229">9.23.3. Upon entering the Air Force, members take an
oath signifying their personal commitment to support and defend the
Constitution of the United States and a commitment and willingness to serve
their country for the duration of their Air Force career. The oath is a solemn
promise to do one’s duty and meet one’s responsibilities. The oath espouses the
responsibility to lead others in the exercise of one’s duty. </p>

<p class="msonormal130">9.23.4. Building warrior leaders who have the
competencies and skills to understand the complexity of expeditionary
operations and the successful execution of airpower capabilities in unilateral,
joint, or coalition operations is a responsibility shared by the Air Force and
individual Airmen. Also, Airmen must be able to use scarce resources
effectively to deliver required air, space, and cyberspace effects. The
development of this warrior ethos is an individual and organizational
responsibility. </p>

<p class="msonormal129">9.23.5. When Air Force forces are employed in
various operational environments, they offer basic characteristics that, when
exploited, are fundamental to the successful conduct of war and peace. These
characteristics, when molded into viable force capabilities and executed by
knowledge-enabled Airmen, enhance the overall ability of the joint team to
achieve success when called upon. Therefore, each Airman should understand and
be able to articulate the full potential and application of Air Force
capabilities required to support the Air Force mission and meet United States
national security objectives. </p>

<p class="msonormal90"><b class="calibre1">9.24. The Warrior Ethos:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal141">9.24.1. The central focus of the profession of arms
is warfighting. As Airmen, we have a special responsibility to ensure the most
lethal Air Force the world has ever seen flies and fights the right way. Airmen
have inherited an Air Force forged through the ingenuity, courage, and strength
of Airmen who preceded them. An Airman’s duty is to continue to provide the
Nation and the next generation of Airmen an equally dominant Air Force. Doing
so requires Airmen to fully understand the profession of arms they have chosen,
the commitment they made by taking an oath of office, and the acceptance to
live according to the Air Force’s core values. This is the warrior ethos and a
mindset designed to build the confidence and commitment necessary to shape
professional Airmen able to work as a team to accomplish the mission. This
mindset is shaped by an expeditionary service during combat, humanitarian
response, disaster relief operations, and by the lessons learned from those
operations. The warrior ethos is also developed and sustained over the course
of a career through a continuum of learning and associated development
experiences, including a wide variety of assignments, focused training and
education, exhibiting pride in the Air Force uniform, physical conditioning,
and understanding Air Force symbols, history, and culture.  </p>

<p class="msonormal230">9.24.2. Airmen share a history of service, honor, and
sacrifice. From the earliest days of airpower to the heights of space, </p>

<p class="msonormal229">Airmen have built an extraordinary heritage that
forms the foundation for the Service’s boundless horizon. Even though we are
technology focused, we value quality over quantity. We embrace change and
through transformation and innovation ensure a viable Air Force for the future.
Airmen firmly grounded in the core values and ingrained with the warrior ethos
react to combat stresses, operational deployment pressures, and daily home
station demands with valor, courage, and sacrifice. We all have these
characteristics, which surface often during times of great difficulty or
unforeseen circumstances. While many acts of valor, courage or sacrifice go
unseen, others helped shape the finest traditions of the Air Force. They should
be recognized not only as part of United States Air Force history, but also to
illustrate that any Airman may be called upon to perform above and beyond in
the profession of arms. </p>

<p class="msonormal90"><b class="calibre1">9.25. Valor.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal129">Valor is the ability to face danger or hardship in a
determined and resolute manner and is commonly known as bravery, fearlessness,
fortitude, gallantry, heart, nerve, and many other terms. Valor is the
willingness to step outside of one’s comfort zone to deal with an unexpected
situation. Such situations can happen almost anywhere. Valor exists in places
other than on the battlefield; an Airman can exhibit valor when presented with
unusual circumstances in the daily routine of life. When acting with valor, one
expresses the qualities of a hero or heroine.<i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal231"><i class="calibre2">In the summer
of 2005, Senior Airman Shea Dodson wanted to do more than his assigned
administrative duties inside of Baghdad’s Green Zone. The call was out for
volunteers to provide security for ongoing convoys, so Airman Dodson raised his
hand. After some intense just-in-time training, he was performing security
detail for his first convoy. On this mission, Airman Dodson put that training
to good use. When a suspected vehicle-borne suicide bomber raced toward the
convoy, he fired .50 caliber rounds into the engine block no fewer than four
times, disabling the vehicle. During the same mission, his unit became mired in
traffic near a high-rise development. He noticed movement above and saw an
Iraqi armed with an AK-47 creeping toward the edge of a balcony overlooking the
convoy. Airman Dodson immediately engaged with indirect warning fire from his
M-16, hitting the wall next to the suspected insurgent’s head. The armed Iraqi
dove for cover and never returned. When the convoy arrived at its final
destination, a children’s school, he continued with a complete security sweep
of the perimeter houses to ensure it was clear. Airman Dodson remained on armed
watch as his team handed out school supplies to the kids in the open courtyard.
By 2 PM that same day, Airman Dodson was back at his desk, keeping track of
critical data for the commanding general of the Multinational Security Transition
Command–Iraq. It was all in a day’s work for this dedicated Airman. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal90"><b class="calibre1">9.26. Courage.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal240">Courage is about the ability to face fear, danger, or
adversity. Three types of courage are critical in the profession of arms: </p>

<p class="msonormal241">personal, physical, and moral. Personal courage is
about doing what’s right even at risk to one’s career. Physical courage is the
ability to overcome fears of bodily harm to get the job done, or willingness to
risk yourself for someone else’s sake in battle or the course of everyday life.
Finally, moral courage is the ability to stand by the core values when moral
courage may not be the popular thing to do. Integrity breeds courage when and
where the behavior is most needed. More often than not, courage is manifested
as an act of bravery on the battlefield as Airmen face the challenges present
in combat. </p>

<p class="msonormal242"><i class="calibre2">While on a
special mission in Southwest Asia in 2005, Technical Sergeant Corey Clewley was
loading cargo on his aircraft when he saw a Romanian C-130 experience a hard
landing. Unbeknownst to the Romanian crew, the aircraft brakes caused a fire,
causing Sergeant Clewley to spring into action. He instructed a fellow
loadmaster to inform his aircraft commander of the situation and to ensure that
someone contacted the control tower of the fire while he and a crew chief
grabbed fire extinguishers and ran toward the burning aircraft. The Romanian
C-130 fire intensified as it spread to the aircraft’s fuselage and ruptured the
hydraulic brake line. Despite the danger to himself, Sergeant Clewley got
within a few feet of the flames and attempted to suppress the fire. His sense
of urgency tripled when he realized the C130 crew was still inside the aircraft
and was unable to get out of the burning aircraft. He saw a member of the crew
mouthing ‘please, please’ and pointing to the troop exit door. Sergeant Clewley
refocused his attention to that area and began suppressing the fire, enabling
the crew to safely exit the aircraft. He continued to keep the fire under
control until the fire department arrived. Sergeant Clewley credits the team
effort that kept the incident from becoming a deadly event and never considered
the risk to his own life as he worked to save a crew and aircraft that was not
part of his responsibility, his service, or even his Nation. He noted that
saving the lives of the people on board was more important than who owned the
aircraft. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal232">Quotations from the Air Force Memorial in Washington,
District of Columbia<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal90"><b class="calibre1">9.27. Sacrifice:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal141">9.27.1. Sacrifice involves a willingness to give
your life, time, or comfort to meet others' needs. Personal sacrifice occurs on
many levels, but is commonly evident in the heroic actions of Airmen in combat.
Day-to-day deployed garrison activities also present opportunities to put
others' needs before individual wants. </p>

<p class="msonormal243"><i class="calibre2">Everyday
people can confront their fears, pains and uncertainties with courage or cower
to the daily decisions facing them. Just being here (at Manas Air Base), you

contribute to your Nation in tangible ways. You faced basic training, skills
training, and deployment to a location worlds away from your normal life. All
have taken courage and prepared you for the impact you are making…your decisions,
your actions, your sacrifices of the luxuries of home, friends, and family do
make a difference. Every day, the Airmen of Manas, from Airman Basic to
Colonel, make decisions that have an impact on the Global War on Terrorism!
Without the contributions of the individual soldier who pays the price to
secure freedom for the many, the mission does not get done. Simply put…because
Airmen have courage…because Airmen make sacrifices…because Airmen are not
intimidated by challenges…because YOU have the courage to live a life of
sacrifice for the ideals of a nation, the mission is accomplished day in and

  President of the United States of America, authorized by Title 10, Section
  8742, U.S.C., awards the Air Force Cross to Senior Airman Jason D. Cunningham
  for extraordinary heroism in military operations against an opposing armed
  force while serving as a pararescueman near the village of Marzak in the
  Paktia Province of Afghanistan on 4 March 2002. On that proud day, Airman
  Cunningham was the primary Air Force Combat Search and Rescue medic assigned
  to a Quick Reaction Force tasked to recover two American servicemen evading
  capture in austere terrain occupied by massed Al Qaida and Taliban forces.
  Shortly before landing, his MH-47E helicopter received accurate
  rocket-propelled grenade and small arms fire, severely disabling the aircraft
  and causing it to crash land. The assault force formed a hasty defense and
  immediately suffered three fatalities and five critical casualties. Despite
  effective enemy fire, and at great risk to his own life, Airman Cunningham
  remained in the burning fuselage of the aircraft in order to treat the
  wounded. As he moved his patients to a more secure location, mortar rounds
  began to impact within fifty feet of his position. Disregarding this extreme
  danger, he continued the movement and exposed himself to enemy fire on seven
  separate occasions. When the second casualty collection point was also
  compromised, in a display of uncommon valor and gallantry, Airman Cunningham
  braved an intense small arms and rocket-propelled grenade attack while
  repositioning the critically wounded to a third collection point. Even after
  he was mortally wounded and quickly deteriorating, he continued to direct
  patient movement and transferred care to another medic. In the end, his
  distinct efforts led to the successful delivery of ten gravely wounded Americans
  to life-saving medical treatment. Through his extraordinary heroism, superb
  airmanship, aggressiveness in the face of the enemy, and in the dedication of
  his service to his country, Senior Airman Cunningham reflected the highest
  credit upon himself and the United States Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal258">9.28.1. We must remember that above all else, we are
Airmen first. We, more than anyone else, understand the price that is paid for
freedom. Airmen, more than anyone else, understand the sacrifices that come
from willingly serving our country. Finally, Airmen more than anyone else,
understand the meaning of belonging to the Profession of Arms. </p>

<p class="msonormal259">9.28.2. We must learn from history. Our shared
touchstone of warrior virtues and single, unifying purpose remain unchanged:
fly, fight, and win. We must remain true to the legacy of valor and devotion,
so boldly written with contrails and smoke across the skies from Ploesti and

<p class="msonormal90"><b class="calibre1">9.29. Readiness: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal142">9.29.1. One of the telltale signs of a military
professional is preparation. When the time comes to use their skills, military
professionals are ready because they took advantage of opportunities to gain
experience. Every military member will have opportunities to serve. Those
opportunities may be mundane, exciting, or inconvenient, but each will provide
a chance to gain experience and improve readiness levels. </p>

<p class="msonormal149">9.29.2. Often, opportunities to serve do not look
particularly exciting or rewarding, but they hold the seeds of greatness. Doing
such tasks builds the experience level needed to sharpen judgment and
discernment. Military members should be open to a variety of experiences in
order to grow in all areas of life (physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual).
Military professionals cannot be disconnected from the world and must remember
that the cost of choosing one path may be the opportunity to take another. </p>

<p class="msonormal262">9.29.3. The military professional who stands ready
to make critical decisions and is able to perform under pressure is usually the
one who took advantage of unique opportunities that arose. From past
experiences, professionals build the confidence, judgment, courage, and
integrity they need to act professionally. Will they always feel ready? Probably
not, but most will likely say they wish they had more experience upon which to
base their decisions or improve their performance. Most experience is gained by
accepting opportunities as they come, even when conditions are not perfect. </p>

<p class="msonormal141">9.29.4. Certainly, no one can do everything. Members
must select wisely to prevent overloading and burnout. They can round out their
perspective vicariously by sharing others’ experiences through reading.
Charles, Archduke of Austria, pointed to this thought when he said, “A great
captain can be formed only by long experience and intense study; neither is his
own experience enough—for whose life is…sufficiently fruitful of events to
render his knowledge universal?” </p>

Reading Program: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal141">9.30.1. In 1996, General Fogleman created the Chief
of Staff, United States Air Force Professional Reading Program to develop a
common frame of reference among Air Force members—officers, enlisted, and
civilians—to help each become better, more effective advocates of air and space
power. Each Chief of Staff, United States Air Force since then has enhanced and
continued the Chief of Staff, United States Air Force’s Professional Reading
Program. In 2012, General Norton A. Schwartz revised the list by adding books;
films; technology, entertainment, design briefings; and online resources. </p>

<p class="msonormal141">9.30.2. This program can help launch a career-long
reading habit or be used to supplement previous readings. Listed materials
cover various topics, although the majority detail air and space power from its
genesis to recent times. These sources provide great examples of leadership to
illustrate qualities Airmen should emulate. The list includes insight into Air
Force history, analyze ongoing conflicts and their relevancy to the future,
furnish organizational and leadership success stories, and provide lessons
learned from recent conflicts. The more you study, the better you will
understand the background behind the Air Force’s core competencies and the
better equipped you will be to form and express your own opinions. </p>

library with multiple copies of each new book on the list.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal90"><b class="calibre1">9.31. Core Values: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal141">9.31.1. Core values are at the heart and soul of the
military profession: <i class="calibre2">integrity first, service before self, and excellence in
all we do. </i>Such values are closely intertwined since integrity provides the
bedrock for our military endeavors, and is fortified by service to country.
This in turn fuels the drive for excellence. In light of the demands placed
upon our people to support United States security interests around the globe,
the concept of “service before self” needs further discussion. As members of
the joint team, Airmen are part of a unique profession founded on the premise
of service before self. Airmen are not engaged in just another job: they are
practitioners of the profession of arms. They are entrusted with the security
of the Nation, the protection of their citizens, and the preservation of their
way of life. In this capacity, they serve as guardians of America’s future, and
this responsibility requires Airmen to place the needs of service and country
before personal concerns. </p>

<p class="msonormal264">9.31.2. The military profession is sharply
distinguished from others by what General Sir John Hackett has termed the
“unlimited liability clause.” Upon entering the Air Force, Airmen accept a
sacred trust from the American people. They swear to support and defend the
Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
They take this obligation freely without any reservations and thereby commit
their lives in defense of America and their citizens. </p>

<p class="msonormal265">9.31.3. No other profession expects their members to lay
down their lives for their friends, families, or freedoms. By voluntarily
serving in the military profession, Airmen accept unique responsibilities. In
today’s world, service to country requires not only a high degree of skill, but
also a willingness to make personal sacrifices. Airmen work long hours to
provide the most combat capability possible for the taxpayer dollar. Military
professional’s duties require them to go temporary duty or permanent change of
station to harsh locations to meet national security needs; are on call 24
hours a day, 7 days a week; and when called, deploy to the far corners of the
globe without complaint. </p>

<p class="msonormal129">9.31.4. Inherent in all of this is individual
willingness to subordinate personal interests for the good of the unit,
Service, and Nation. Airmen can ill afford “sunshine soldiers,” or those who
focus on careerism. Instead, the military needs professionals who strive to be
the best at their current job, and who realize they attain individual
advancement through the success of their unit or work center. Careerism can be
most damaging in the case of leaders. If subordinates perceive leaders are
consumed with career concerns, they will be unwilling to forgo personal goals
for the good of the unit and the Air Force. This situation is only aggravated
by attempts to serve “through a position” or to do a quick “touch and go” in a
key job simply to fill out a resume. Ultimately, the mission will suffer with
potentially devastating consequences. </p>

<p class="msonormal141">9.31.5. So, what is the payoff for placing service
before self? The paycheck or the benefits is not what keeps the professionals
going. Professionals remain with the Air Force because of the intangibles: the
satisfaction gained from doing something significant with their lives, the
pride in being part of a unique organization that lives by high standards, and
the sense of accomplishment gained from defending the Nation and their
democratic way of life. </p>

<p class="msonormal90"><b class="calibre1">9.32. Conclusion: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal141">9.32.1. This chapter discusses the philosophy,
purpose, and structure of the enlisted force and examines the NCO in terms of
rank and precedence, legal authority, and general and specific
responsibilities. Also briefly described is the special positions of trust
senior NCOs may hold, such as Air Force career filed manager, first sergeant,
Command Chief Master Sergeant, and Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, and
concludes with a discussion of the profession of arms. </p>

<p class="msonormal130">9.32.2. The word “professional” should inspire all
enlisted members to aspire to the ideal of service and expertise. Professional
status comes to people at different times in their lives and careers.
Furthermore, professionalism is achieved through continuous study, practice,
and experience. Overall, the military seems to fit strongly into the professional
category, but at what point can an individual claim professional military
status? Professional status is expressed by attitudes and commitments, and by
internalizing military values. Studying and understanding these factors are
vital to the senior NCO and the future of the United States Air Force. Every
senior NCO has an obligation to the United States, to the Air Force, and to his
or her supervisor and subordinates to be the very best professional possible. </p>

<p class="msonormal266">9.32.3. Future military members must educate
themselves through study, experience, and by observing others. They must learn
to accept responsibility for their actions and those of their subordinates, and
to take appropriate action, never hiding behind excuses. Their focus must be on
devoted service to the Nation, not on pay, working conditions, or their next
assignment. Only then will they move toward achieving the ideal of
professionalism.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

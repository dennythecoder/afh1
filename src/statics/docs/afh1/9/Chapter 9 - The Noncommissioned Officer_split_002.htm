<p class="msonormal27">9.5.3.4.10.
<b class="calibre1">CMSAF Gary R. <span class="grame">Pfingston</span>: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal38"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1035" src="image013.png" class="calibre9"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal39">9.5.3.4.10.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Gary R. <span class="grame">Pfingston</span> played minor league baseball before enlisting in
the Air Force as an aircraft mechanic. During his first assignment as a B-52
crew chief at Castle Air Force Base, California, he went to work one day with a
pack of cigarettes and $2, and did not return home for 30 days because the
Cuban Missile Crisis sent the base into lockdown. Ten years later, <span class="grame">Pfingston</span> worked aircraft maintenance in Thailand, <span class="grame">reconfiguring  B</span>-52s to carry conventional bombs in
what became known as “iron belly” modifications. In 1973, he returned to the
states and spent the next 8 1/2 years as a military training instructor, and
later, chief of the military training division. During an assignment to
Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, <span class="grame">Pfingston</span> broke his
back, was hospitalized for 147 days, and returned to duty as the first
sergeant. Future assignments had <span class="grame">Pfingston</span> taking
part in the first ability to survive and operate exercise in a chemical
environment and serving as a senior enlisted advisor. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">9.5.3.4.10.2. CMSAF <span class="grame">Pfingston’s</span> focus during his tenure was the Air Force
drawdown and budget. Holding the highest enlisted position during Desert Storm,
he worked to restore basic allowance for subsistence to the troops living in
field conditions and increasing the Servicemember’s Group Life Insurance, but
the toughest challenge he faced was the Air Force downsizing. To avoid
involuntary separations, <span class="grame">Pfingston</span> worked to
implement the Voluntary Separation Incentive and Special Separation Bonus
Programs. His idea to provide career paths and milestones in line with the
officer career model, led to the career field education and training plan,
three-level and seven-level technical schools for all career fields, and
mandatory in-residence PME schools. He also found himself involved with issues
such as homosexuals serving in the military, Air Force specialty codes opening
up to women, assignment policies including the Enlisted Quarterly Assignments
Listing (EQUAL) and EQUAL-Plus, and even the introduction of the new senior NCO
stripes. <span class="grame">Pfingston</span> remained active in what he called
the “communication chain” of former CMSAFs advocating for the enlisted force after
his retirement. CMSAF <span class="grame">Pfingston</span> died in 2007.<span class="calibre19"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal27">9.5.3.4.11.
<b class="calibre1">CMSAF David J. <span class="grame">Campanale</span>: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal41"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1034" src="image014.png" class="calibre20"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal42">9.5.3.4.11.1. Worcester,
Massachusetts, native David J. <span class="grame">Campanale</span> said he had
the world by the throat after high school. A promising athlete, when a baseball
career fell through, his mother encouraged him to join the Air Force in 1970. <span class="grame">Campanale</span> completed aircraft maintenance technical school
despite poor study habits and breaking his collarbone playing football. He
credits his supervisors at his first base with turning his attitude around. <span class="grame">Campanale</span> sought challenges, volunteering for several tours
to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, in support of B-52 Arc Light missions in
Southeast Asia. He later volunteered to transfer to aerial repair. As he rose
through the ranks, <span class="grame">Campanale</span> earned the distinguished
graduate award at both the NCO academy and senior NCO academy and was stripes
for exceptional performer-promoted to Master Sergeant. He later served as a
senior enlisted advisor, a role called “richly rewarding.” </p>

<p class="msonormal42">9.5.3.4.11.2. The year CMSAF <span class="grame">Campanale</span> began his tour, the military launched the new
TRICARE health program. The change introduced many questions and a great deal
of anxiety. He led the charge to alleviate those feelings through education.
Also, when Congress threatened to change the retirement system to “High One”
effectively reducing retirement pay, <span class="grame">Campanale</span>
quickly responded. With senior leader support, <span class="grame">Campanale</span>
stood before Congress in the successful fight against the proposed change.
Another important recruitment and retention milestone was adoption of the
one-plus-one dormitory standard, which gave each Airman his or her own room.
Not a proponent of long speeches, while visiting bases he encouraged questions
rather than delivering a speech, which created meaningful dialogue. He believes
anyone can become CMSAF and offers those who want to follow in his footsteps
this piece of advice: Be honest and keep your promise. <span class="grame">Campanale</span>
continues to actively mentor Airmen serving today. </p>

<p class="msonormal27">9.5.3.4.12.
<b class="calibre1">CMSAF Eric W. <span class="grame">Benken</span>: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal43"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1033" src="image015.png" class="calibre11"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal39">9.5.3.4.12.1. Raised in Cincinnati,
Ohio, after graduating high school Eric W. <span class="grame">Benken</span>
moved to Houston, Texas, to join his parents. Struggling to find a good paying
job out of the area, he joined the Air Force as an administrative specialist. Although
first assigned to Ellington Air Force Base, Texas (less than 25 miles from Houston),
he would get his chance to travel 9 months later, on orders to Ching <span class="grame">Chuan</span> Kang Air Base, Taiwan. During his tour, he deployed
to South Vietnam, where he spent his 20th birthday. As the United States Air
Forces Europe senior enlisted advisor, he facilitated the highly successful <span class="grame">beddown</span> of forces during the Bosnia Operation Joint
Endeavor. He led numerous quality-of-life initiatives, including
eliminating/remodeling a third of the United States Air Forces Europe
zero-privacy dormitories, making way for the newly developed one-plus-one
dormitories. During his assignment, <span class="grame">Benken</span> crafted
the NCO Professional Development Seminar, an effort to fill the career
education void between Airman Leadership School and the NCO academy. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">9.5.3.4.12.2. During his tenure as CMSAF, he
focused heavily on fundamental discipline, getting back to basics, and changing
the culture of the Air Force to meet new expeditionary requirements. He
championed Warrior Week at basic training and ensured funding for a simulated
deployed location at <span class="grame">Lackland</span> Air Force Base, Texas.
He instituted changes in the First Sergeant Academy curriculum, focusing on
deployment responsibilities. He believed changing the title “senior enlisted
advisor” to “Command Chief Master Sergeant” and adding the star to the chevron
were critical to the success of these positions, in garrison and on the
battlefield. CMSAF <span class="grame">Benken</span> engaged Congress and
special interest groups on numerous fronts, ultimately defeating attempts to
alter basic military training gender-integrated training, and reversing the
diminished retirement system of 1986. Other significant challenges included
ensuring TRICARE met health care needs, and modernizing the force with a
limited budget. He believed Air Force leaders should focus on the future and
take steps to prepare the force for the next century. <span class="grame">Benken</span>
served as the first co-chair of the Air Force Retiree Council, currently serves
on the board of directors for the Airmen Memorial Foundation and the Mission
Readiness Organization Executive Advisory Council, and continues to speak at a
variety of Air Force functions. </p>

<p class="msonormal27">9.5.3.4.13.
<b class="calibre1">CMSAF Jim Finch: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal44"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1032" src="image016.png" class="calibre10"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal44"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">CMSAF
Frederic</span></b><span class="calibre21">–</span><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">k J. Finch</span></b><span class="calibre21">   </span><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16"> </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal44"><span class="calibre21">August
1999 - June 2002</span></p>

<p class="msonormal44">9.5.3.4.13.1. Jim Finch entered the Air Force from
East Hampton, New York, expecting to do only a 4-year hitch. He planned to
learn a trade and see what the world had to offer and move on. Finch spent the
early part of his career in the “bomb dumps” as a missile maintenance crew chief
before becoming a PME instructor. After 4 years of teaching, Finch moved to the
Leadership and Management Development Center at Maxwell Air Force Base Alabama.
While there, he helped develop a correspondence version of the NCO preparatory
course, and taught new PME instructors. He was subsequently selected as the Air
Force NCO PME functional manager at the Air Force Military Personnel Center.
While there, he was involved in restructuring the PME program from four to
three levels and implementing procedures to create Airman Leadership School and
allow Master Sergeants to attend the senior NCO academy. Finch later served as
an NCO Academy commandant, the 11th Air Force senior enlisted advisor, and Air
Combat Command, Command Chief Master Sergeant.
 
</p>

<p class="msonormal45">9.5.3.4.13.2. When CMSAF Finch took the reins, the
Air Force was moving from <sup class="calibre18"> </sup><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre22"> </span></sup>a cold war to an expeditionary mindset. He
implemented CMSAF <span class="grame">Benken’s</span> basic training Warrior
Week vision to help new recruits understand that the expeditionary Air Force
was not a temporary concept. He credits the program’s success to the men and
women at <span class="grame">Lackland</span> candidates and gave commanders more
selection flexibility. Known as a man of vision, he spent 3 years focusing on
enlisted members’ concerns, and implementing programs to improve future
preparedness. Finch recognized that the armed forces had to change to meet
changing threats to national security. He believed future-focused leaders were
paramount to success and made significant contributions to ensure the force
developed that kind of leader. Finch maintains his vision for Airmen by serving
on boards of Air <span class="grame">Forceassociated</span> organizations,
visiting Air Force members worldwide, and supporting current CMSAF agendas. </p>

<p class="msonormal46"> </p>

<p class="msonormal47">9.5.3.4.14.
<b class="calibre1">CMSAF Gerald R. Murray: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal48"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1031" src="image017.png" class="calibre9"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal48">9.5.3.4.14.1. Gerald R. Murray, a
native of Boiling Springs, North Carolina, grew up on his grandfather’s farm.
Graduating high school in 1974, he briefly attended college, married his school
sweetheart, and worked in textile mills and construction before entering the
Air Force as an F-4 aircraft crew chief in 1977. Murray’s performance and
capabilities were quickly recognized by his promotion to Senior Airman below
the zone, and selection as an F-16 aircraft maintenance instructor. He
continued to excel as the senior F-16 crew chief on "Victor Alert" at
<span class="grame">Incirlik</span> Air Base, Turkey, and later as an A-10
squadron production superintendent. Deployed in support of Operations Desert
Shield and Desert Storm, he played a key role as the combat turn director at
the most forward operation location in theater, garnering the Bronze Star, and
later the Air Force General Lew Allen Trophy. After standing up a new A-10
squadron at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia, Murray’s performance and leadership
were recognized again when he was pulled from the flight line to serve as the
347th Wing Senior Enlisted Advisor and Command Chief Master Sergeant. He later
served as the command Chief Master Sergeant at 5th Air Force, United States
Forces Japan, and Pacific Air Forces Command. </p>

<p class="msonormal39">9.5.3.4.14.2. An evolving
expeditionary air force and a changed world after the 11 September 2001
terrorist attacks were catalysts for change during Murray’s tenure. Murray
refocused basic military training and PME toward expeditionary combat
principles and took a leading role in developing a new physical fitness program
to improve Air Force-wide capabilities and readiness. Additionally, Murray led
efforts to balance the enlisted force structure by increasing high-year tenure
for four enlisted grades, bringing back the career job reservation and NCO
retraining programs, and redistributing senior NCO promotions in critical and
unbalanced Air Force specialty codes. Understanding the need to maintain strong
leadership, he initiated a deliberate approach to NCO professional development;
led changes to the management of Chief Master Sergeants, including alignment
under the Air Force Senior Leaders Management Office, and added a Chief Master
Sergeant’s leadership course to the enlisted PME continuum. In retirement,
Murray remains active in shaping Airmen development, serving with Air Force
professional organizations and continuing to speak throughout the force. </p>

<p class="msonormal47">9.5.3.4.15.<b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre19"> </span>CMSAF Rodney J. McKinley:</b><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre19"> </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal49"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1030" src="image018.png" class="calibre9"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal49">9.5.3.4.15.1. Rodney J. McKinley grew
up in Mt. <span class="grame">Orab</span>, Ohio, and originally entered the Air
Force in 1974 as a medical technician. He separated from the Air Force in 1977
to pursue his education. He returned to active duty in 1982 as an aircraft
maintenance specialist and served in various aircraft maintenance positions at
Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina, and Clark Air Base, Philippines.
In 1991, he became a first sergeant, a position he held for the next 10 years,
with assignments at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina; <span class="grame">Ghedi</span> Air Base, Italy; Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma; and
Ramstein Air Base, Germany. Chief McKinley then served as a command Chief
Master Sergeant at Ramstein Air Base, Germany; Langley Air Force Base,
Virginia; and 11th Air Force at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. In February
2003, during the early days of Operation Iraqi Freedom, he deployed as Command
Chief Master Sergeant to the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, Southwest Asia.
Before being selected as the 15th CMSAF, he was the Pacific Air Forces Command
Chief Master Sergeant at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii. </p>

<p class="msonormal50">9.5.3.4.15.2. During his tenure, CMSAF
McKinley was an advocate for winning the Global War on Terrorism, developing
and taking care of Airmen, and modernizing aging air, space, and cyberspace
assets. CMSAF McKinley focused on properly organizing, training, and equipping
Airmen during a time when many were being tasked outside their core
competencies. His efforts to improve the enlisted evaluation system resulted in
the first major changes to feedback and performance report forms since 1990.
CMSAF McKinley also advocated for an educated enlisted corps and strongly encouraged
Airmen to pursue their Community College of the Air Force degree earlier in
their careers. A strong advocate for the “American Airman” spirit, he opened
the door for creation of the Airman’s Creed, which codified core Air Force
beliefs and articulated the warrior ethos. His vision led to the creation of
the Enlisted Heroes Walk on the parade field at <span class="grame">Lackland</span>
Air Force Base, Texas, and the return of the enlisted collar brass and Good
Conduct Medal. CMSAF McKinley also pursued improvements in Airman health and
fitness, wounded warrior care, child care, spousal employment opportunities,
and accompanied and unaccompanied housing. </p>

<p class="msonormal47">9.5.3.4.16.<b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre19"> </span>CMSAF James A. Roy:</b><span class="calibre19"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal51"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1029" src="image019.png" class="calibre17"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal51">9.5.3.4.16.1. James A. Roy grew up in
Monroe, Michigan, and originally entered the Air Force in 1982 as a heavy
equipment operator. He served in various civil engineer positions at MacDill
Air Force Base, Florida; <span class="grame">Osan</span> Air Base, Republic of
Korea; <span class="grame">Kunsan</span> Air Base, Korea; Andersen Air Force
Base, Guam; and Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi. He returned to the site of
his original technical training— Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri—as an instructor
and instructor supervisor. As a Senior Master Sergeant, he transferred into
personnel as the military personnel flight superintendent, Keesler Air Force
Base, in 1999. From there, Chief Roy served as a Command Chief Master Sergeant
at wing, numbered Air Force, and unified combatant command levels. These
assignments included Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi; Charleston Air Force
Base South Carolina; Langley Air Force Base, Virginia; and 5th Air Force and
United States Forces Japan, at Yokota Air Base, Japan. In October 2004, he
deployed as the 386th Air Expeditionary Wing, Southwest Asia Command Chief
Master Sergeant. He then served as the United States Pacific Command senior
enlisted leader at Camp H.M. Smith, Hawaii. </p>

<p class="msonormal52">9.5.3.4.16.2. Chief Roy’s key focus
areas included ensuring Airmen were ready for joint and coalition operations;
deliberately developing Airmen through education, training and experience; and
building a culture of resiliency within Airmen and their families. He worked to
expand and solidify training and engagement in joint and coalition
environments, which helped enhance the employability of Airmen in the
increasingly joint and coalition warfighting environment. He also stressed the
importance of updating and expanding distance-learning opportunities, and
developed and promoted the Enlisted PME-Next construct, designed to close the
gap in PME following Airman Leadership School.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal47">9.5.3.4.17.<b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre19"> </span>CMSAF James A. Cody:</b><span class="calibre19"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal53"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1028" src="image020.png" class="calibre11"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal54">9.5.3.4.17.1. James A. Cody grew up in
Lakeville, Massachusetts, and entered the Air Force in 1984 as an air traffic
controller. He served in various air traffic control positions at Ramstein Air
Base, Germany; Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire; Vandenberg Air Force Base,
California; <span class="grame">Osan</span> Air Base, Republic of Korea; <span class="grame">Incirlik</span> Air Base, Turkey; Langley Air Force Base,
Virginia; and MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. In April 2002, he deployed as the
superintendent of the Joint Task Force– Southwest Asia Combat Airspace
Management Cell. Chief Cody then served as a Command Chief Master Sergeant at a
task force; wing; numbered Air Force; and major command level. These included
assignments to Travis Air Force Base, California; MacDill Air Force Base,
Florida; 18th Air Force at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, and Air Education
and Training Command at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas.  </p>

<p class="msonormal55">9.5.3.4.17.2. Immediately upon
assuming the position, Chief Cody committed to the continued evolution of the
enlisted force. He identified various policies and processes, and with the
support of the Air Force Chief of Staff and Enlisted Board of Directors moved
each of them forward to ensure the enlisted force was prepared for future
challenges. He focused on the deliberate development of Airmen, evolving
enlisted PME to a blended learning model, and establishing Developmental
Special Duties, which ensured top Airmen were in leadership positions that best
leveraged their proven performance across the force. He heightened the
conversation surrounding work/life balance and the importance of finding a
reasonable and sustainable demand signal for Airmen, and strengthened care and
support programs for Wounded Warriors, including Airmen with invisible wounds
such as TBI and/or PTSD. Additionally, Chief Cody moved the Enlisted Evaluation

Airmanship. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal84">9.12.1. Airmanship Defined. The Army
has soldiers. The Navy has sailors. The Marine Corps has marines. The Air Force
has Airmen. From the Airman Basic to the Four-Star General, we in the Air Force
are all Airmen. As Airmen, we are part of a professional subculture and we
demonstrate various disciplines in defense of our Nation through something we
call Airmanship.<span class="calibre6"> </span>Airmanship
is the mindset, evident in our behaviors, that causes us to proudly exhibit the
highest levels of professional service to our country. </p>

<p class="msonormal86"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1026" src="image022.png" class="calibre24"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal86"><b class="calibre1">Figure 9.4. Airmanship </b></p>

<p class="msonormal87">9.12.1.2. What exactly is this mindset?
The dictionary defines mindset as <i class="calibre2">“a mental disposition or attitude that
predetermines one’s responses and interpretations of situations</i>.” In the
case of Airmanship, that mental disposition or attitude (mindset) is what we
think and how we feel about membership in the profession of arms, and that
mindset is reflected in our behavior. A genuine belief in the <b class="calibre1">oath of
enlistment</b>, an embracement of Air Force <b class="calibre1">core values</b> as your own,
commitment to the <b class="calibre1">profession of arms</b> and an unstoppable determination
known as <b class="calibre1">warrior ethos</b> are the hallmarks of that mindset. Such a mindset
produces pride, selfless service, and care for our country. This mindset is what
we aspire to create and sustain in order to perpetuate behaviors necessary for
mission accomplishment. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">9.12.1.3. Our behavior is a direct result of
our mindset (belief, commitment, embracement, and willingness), and
demonstrates our personal commitment to membership in the profession of arms.
Adherence to and enforcement of standards, the willingness to fulfill all
responsibilities, impeccable wear of the uniform, readiness to perform mission
objectives, and perpetuation of the Air Force culture provide a clear picture
of what we expect Airman behavior to look like. (See Figure 9.4). </p>

<p class="msonormal71">9.12.2. <b class="calibre1">Airmen’s Week (Airmanship
100). </b>Airmen’s Week is the first phase in CSAF’s larger “Culture of
Excellence” initiative; Airmen’s week is the first touch-point in career-long
continuum of professionalism development. Airmen’s Week is a stand-alone course
that commences immediately following Basic Military Training (BMT) but before
Airmen start technical training. Every Airman (including Guard &amp; Reserve)
graduating from BMT has attended Airmen’s week, which began on 23 Mar 2015.</p>

<p class="msonormal61">9.12.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Mission and Goals. </b>Airmen’s
Week equips Airmen to transition from a solid BMT foundation to the
personalization of integrity, service, and excellence. It enables them to apply
our core values to real-world situations and demonstrate the dignity, respect,
and pride that all Airmen should have in themselves and others. Airmen’s Week
challenges these Airmen to examine their personal values and decision-making
framework to embrace the Airmen’s Creed.  The goal is a more professional,
resilient Airman, inspired by our heritage, committed to the Air Force core
values, and motivated to deliver Airpower for America. </p>

<p class="msonormal64">9.12.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Curriculum. </b>Airmen’s
Week is a 31-hour course with a curriculum designed to utilize “affective

Airmen, regardless of their Air Force specialty, are recruiters. A WEAR event
is an event where the interaction of Air Force personnel educates and increases
public awareness of the Air Force and could potentially provide numerous leads
for recruiters. Approval for WEAR is limited to those events where Airmen are
directly speaking to potential applicants or influencers about Air Force
opportunities. Applicants are defined as individuals within the 17- to
39-year-old range; and influencers are defined as parents, community leaders,
teachers, counselors, coaches, etc. WEAR events are approved on an individual
basis. For those events where multiple Airmen are attending, each attendee must
submit a package for approval. WEAR requests must be first approved by the
individual’s commander in accordance with AFI 36-3003, <i class="calibre2">Military Leave

<p class="msonormal88"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 9D—Military Ethics </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal98"><b class="calibre1">9.16.
Introduction. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal81">Military ethics is about each Airman
doing what is right and just for our country, Air Force, and unit. Our Air
Force, driven towards excellence by competence and character, is built upon
thousands of good Americans that have volunteered to defend our country. These
Airman realize truth and integrity are more than buzz words; those words are
the focal point of our moral compass. As General John D. Ryan, the 16th Air
Force Chief of Staff, said "any order to compromise integrity is not a
lawful order." Airmen must have the courage to be the type of people we
ought to be. Ethical Airmen are not focused on personal successes or virtues. </p>

<p class="msonormal58">9.16.1. As an Airman serving proudly
in the Profession of Arms, you definitely know the difference between right and
wrong. The Air Force provides guiding rules and standards through an ethical
code. An ethical code guides us in our daily decision making. Our ethical code
is prescribed throughout our Air Force Core Values, Oath of Enlistment, Oath of
Office, Air Force Instructions, and the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
You’ll be faced with decisions. Some decisions you will have to make. Other
decisions you will help your wingmen make. These decisions might be related to
your mission, your personal life, or the interest of your peers. The choice you
make can be successful when you’re utilizing sound ethical principles. </p>

<p class="msonormal64">9.16.1.1. Sound ethical principles are
rooted in our Air Force Core Values. Our core values of Integrity First,
Service Before Self, and Excellence <span class="grame">In</span> All We Do
clearly define our identity. Every Airman learns to cherish our core values
when they enter our profession. They begin by reading the core values, then
understanding the core values, and finally living the core values. Expanding
upon our core values lead us to virtues we must practice and demonstrate in our
lives. </p>

<p class="msonormal89">9.16.1.2. Integrity First is a
character trait and the willingness to do what is right even when no one is
looking.  Integrity is your moral compass and inner voice of self-control.
The virtues of honesty, courage, and accountability stem from Integrity First.
Honesty means our words must be unquestionable so we preserve the trust that
unites us through common goal and purpose. Courage is about doing the right
thing despite fear and empowers us to make ourselves better. Accountability
instills our responsibility while maintaining transparency and ownership for
our actions. </p>

<p class="msonormal89">9.16.1.3. Service Before Self tells us
professional duties take precedence over personal desires. The virtues of duty,
loyalty, and respect blossom from Service Before Self. Duty is our obligation
to perform what is required for the mission; sometimes having to make
sacrifices in ways that no other profession has or will. Loyalty is our
internal commitment to the success and preservation of something bigger than
ourselves, ordered as country, Air Force, and unit. Respect requires us to
treat each other with dignity and value them as individuals, knowing all Airmen
possess fundamental worth as human beings. </p>

<p class="msonormal61">9.16.1.4. Excellence <span class="grame">In</span>
All We Do directs us to develop a sustained passion for the continuous
improvement and innovation that propels the Air Force, as well as ourselves,
beyond the capabilities of our adversaries. The virtues of mission, discipline,
and teamwork are the cornerstone of Excellence <span class="grame">In</span> All
We Do. Mission encompasses operations, product, and resource excellence; must
accomplish our duties correctly while practicing fiscal responsibility.
Discipline is an individual commitment to uphold the highest standards of personal
and professional conduct, which we demonstrate with attitude, work ethic, and
continuous improvement. Required is teamwork at every level to complete the
mission and we must recognize the interdependency of each Airmen’s contribution
toward the mission and strive for organizational excellence. </p>

<p class="msonormal65">9.16.1.5. An ethical dilemma is a
situation where one is forced to choose between at least two alternatives.
Three general causes of ethical dilemmas are uncertainty, competing values, and
potential harm. Uncertainty is the result of not having all the facts
pertaining to the situation, having no experience dealing with the situation,
or not having a clearly established policy, procedure, or rule for deciding how
to choose. Competing values occur when our personal values conflict with those
of our institution, subordinates, peers, or supervisors; however, the mark of a
true professional is maintaining high professional standards despite
conflicting values. Potential harm relates to the intentional and unintentional
consequences caused by your actions; you should always think through second and
third order consequences of your actions. When facing an ethical dilemma, Dr.
James H. Toner provides us the framework of ethical principles for decision
making. </p>

<p class="msonormal59">9.16.2. According to Dr. James H. Toner,
former Professor of International Relations and Military Ethics, Air War
College, military ethics is rooted in the three <span class="grame">Os</span>: <i class="calibre2">owing,</i>
<i class="calibre2">ordering</i>, and <span class="grame"><i class="calibre2">oughting</i></span>. </p>

<p class="msonormal64">9.16.2.1. Military ethics cannot
properly exist without the concept of owing. If we, as Airmen, know who and why
we owe, we are able to recognize the obligation, responsibility, and duty which
give rise to moral thinking and ethical reasoning. Airmen must understand they
owe a debt of gratitude to our country, family, service, chain of command, and
comrades. Additionally, from the pioneers of aviation to the selfless sacrifice
of battlefield Airmen, we owe to those who came before us and those we serve
with today to strive for “excellence in all we do”.  Furthermore, this is
a reflection of the core value “service before self” as identified in the
Airman’s Creed: <i class="calibre2">I am faithful to a proud heritage, a tradition of honor, and
a legacy of valor</i>.  </p>

<p class="msonormal64">9.16.2.2. The second O is for ordering,
or what Dr. Toner calls moral structuring and ethical priorities. In other
words, are you putting your priorities in the right order? Many illegal
activities or easily prevented mistakes are the result of a leader’s failure to
order<i class="calibre2"> </i>wisely and well. As defenders of freedom and justice, we take an oath
to defend the Constitution of the United States, and to obey the President and
the officers appointed over us, in that order. As Airmen, our highest priority
is to serve our country. We can never sacrifice the good of our nation for the
good of our service, our superiors, or ourselves. According to Dr. Toner, the
proper ordering of our priorities should be country, Air Force, and then unit.
Dr. Toner explains that to understand this concept, look at the service tape on
your uniform and notice the United States always comes before Air Force. We
pronounce the same when we recite our Airman’s Creed: <i class="calibre2">I am an American
Airman, I am a warrior, I have answered my nation’s call.</i> </p>

<p class="msonormal89">9.16.2.3. The final O, <span class="grame">oughting</span>, is the understanding of what Airmen ought to do
every day. What Airmen do may not be what they ought to do and this may sound
simple, but military hierarchies insist upon obedience to orders and total
discipline. Ethics, however, objects to this, insisting upon conditional and
contextual obedience to orders, which ought to be obeyed, if lawful. The <i class="calibre2">Manual
for Courts-Martial</i>, Rule 916, states “It is a defense to any offense that
the accused was acting pursuant to orders unless the accused knew the orders to
be unlawful or a person of ordinary sense and understanding would have known
the orders to be unlawful.” Our core values help guide us in the direction of
what we ought to do. </p>

<p class="msonormal59">9.16.3. To support our concept of ordering,
we are introduced to the three Ps: <i class="calibre2">principle</i>, <i class="calibre2">purpose</i>, and <i class="calibre2">people</i>. 
</p>

<p class="msonormal99">9.16.3.1. Our principle, which is truth telling and honorable
service, is always first. Truth telling goes hand in hand with our core value
of “integrity first”, which is the foundation of trust. Trust unites us as
Airmen and permits you to grow a strong wingman bond. Honorable service is
detailed in the Code of Conduct, which in and of itself is an ethical guide.
Just ask Captain Scott F. O’Grady, who was shot down behind enemy lines. </p>

<p class="msonormal100">9.16.3.2. Our purpose as Airmen, clearly defined as
mission accomplishment and duty, is why our service exists.  From hot air
balloons to wooden propellers to turbofan engines, Airmen have risen to the
challenge at hand. We are the Tuskegee Airmen that never let an escorted bomber
get shot down. We are the liberators of the oppressed as evidenced in Operation
Desert Storm. We are the future of advanced warfare which we proudly proclaim
in the Airman’s Creed:<i class="calibre2"> I am an American, <span class="grame">My</span> mission
is to fly, fight, and win.</i> </p>

<p class="msonormal100">9.16.3.3. Our people make all of this possible. Just
look to the walls of the Enlisted Heritage Research Institute to see this is
true. Staff Sergeant William H. <span class="grame">Pitsenbarger</span> gave his
life aiding and defending a unit of soldiers pinned down by an enemy assault.
Sergeant John L. <span class="grame">Levitow</span> disregarded his own wounds
and saved the lives of his entire crew. Senior Airman Jason D. Cunningham gave
his life so that others may live. Airman First Class Elizabeth N. Jacobson made
the ultimate sacrifice while guarding a convoy of American service men and
women. These heroic Airmen personified this passage from the Airman’s Creed: <i class="calibre2">I
am an American Airman, guardian of freedom and justice, my nation’s sword and
shield, its sentry and avenger, I defend my country with my life.</i> </p>

<p class="msonormal101">9.16.4. To assist our decision making, we incorporate the
three <span class="grame">Rs</span>: <i class="calibre2">rules</i>,<i class="calibre2"> results</i>, and <i class="calibre2">realities</i>.
</p>

<p class="msonormal102">9.16.4.1. First, obey the rules because the rules are
the accepted moral norms. However, we can’t create rules for every possible
situation. When facing an ethical dilemma and asking yourself “What ought I do?”
reflect on the core values to idealize the person we want to be and the example
we want to set.  </p>

<p class="msonormal103">9.16.4.2. Additionally, results are the goals of
country, Air Force, and unit and our responsibility as Airmen is to accomplish
the mission. However, in the climate of decentralized execution, our
responsibility is to figure out how to accomplish the mission. Do not make
decisions based on self-interests.  </p>

<p class="msonormal104">9.16.4.3. Finally, realities are inputs that effect
our decision-making. We must use our self-awareness to realize who we are and
what we do; because, what we do is who we are and who we are is what we do. If
your moral compass needs calibration, your decision will not direct you on the
right path. When your moral compass is well maintained, you will guide your
country, Air Force, and unit upon a righteous path. </p>

<p class="msonormal101">9.16.5. To put the three <span class="grame">Os</span> into
action, we utilize the three Ds: <i class="calibre2">discern</i>, <i class="calibre2">declare</i>, and <i class="calibre2">do</i>.
</p>

<p class="msonormal63">9.16.5.1. We must discern, or recognize, the correct path
to lead our Airmen on. Attentive wingmen utilize critical thinking to discern.
Remember to properly <i class="calibre2">order</i> your thinking. </p>

<p class="msonormal63">9.16.5.2. We must declare the correct path as we have
discerned the correct path. Effective leaders educate and promote the growth of
their team. Your inclusion of team members will enhance the change process. </p>

<p class="msonormal103">9.16.5.3. Then we must do what we have discerned and
declared. Spirited warriors accomplish the mission. We speak these truths when
reciting the Airman’s Creed: <i class="calibre2">I am an American Airman, wingman, leader,
warrior, I will never leave an Airman behind, I will never falter, and I will
not fail.<b class="calibre1"> </b></i></p>

<p class="msonormal105">9.16.6. As Airmen, we owe those who wore the uniform
before us. We are free today because others sacrificed their time, effort, and
lives to make our country what our country is, and we must continue the fight
to ensure our country stays strong and secure. We must also order<i class="calibre2"> </i>our
priorities so we are able to overcome any temptation to stray from our military
norms and values. Finally, we should always do what we ought<i class="calibre2"> </i>to do. </p>

<p class="msonormal106">9.16.6.1. When contemplating what to do, considering
your possible courses of action is important. By listing your possible
decisions that could correct the situation, you can quality check your ideas to
take the most moral path. Put each of your courses of action to the test. Dr.
Robert M. Hicks, former Deputy Director of the Civil Air Patrol, Chaplain
Services, identified three tests we can use to check the morality of our
actions. </p>

<p class="msonormal102">9.16.6.2. The network test consists of asking
yourself, “How would this decision look when aired on the news?” If your
actions were broadcast on the evening news, would you be proud of your actions
or ashamed of your actions?  Would your actions discredit yourself or
those we owe? If you find the answer to be the latter, then your decision doesn’t
pass the network test. </p>

<p class="msonormal107">9.16.6.3. The United States of America test focuses
on asking yourself, “Is this decision good for America? Is this decision good
for the United States Air Force? Is this decision good for my unit? Is this
decision good for me?” If you take this course of action, are you properly
ordering your priorities? Would your actions promote the virtues of Service
Before Self (duty, loyalty, and respect)? If you can’t answer this with a
resounding yes, this might not be the best decision. </p>

<p class="msonormal104">9.16.6.4. The divine test deals with asking yourself,
“Would I feel good about the decision when I give account for my life?” When
telling the story of your proud and honorable service to our country, would you
include conversation about this decision? Would you feel guilt or loss of trust
from this action? If you can’t answer this with a positive input, the course of
action fails the divine test. </p>

<p class="msonormal103">9.16.6.5. Utilizing the information provided to you
should provide you with a clear path of understanding on how to make ethical
decisions. What is important to keep your focus on are two main areas of
honorable service: your commitment to the Profession of Arms and your ability
to make ethical choices. You can build your own ethical knowledge while
fostering that of your peers. Remind yourself and your peers of the reason you
do what you do, as found in the Oath of Enlistment or Oath of Office. Declare
the importance of adhering to established ethical codes, relying on them when
faced with a choice between right and wrong. Use Dr. Toner’s model and Dr.
Hicks’ three tests when making ethical choices. </p>

<p class="msonormal101">9.16.7. Military ethics is not about others, but is about <i class="calibre2">you</i>
knowing what is true and doing what is right; about being the man or woman who
leads the kind of life <i class="calibre2">you</i> can be proud of. </p>

<p class="msonormal88"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 9E—Enlisted Force
Development </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal57"><b class="calibre1">9.17.
Introduction. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal108">Enlisted Force Development is a life-cycle approach
to developing innovative Airmen prepared to accomplish the Air Force mission and
lead in a rapidly evolving global environment while attempting to meet both
personal and professional needs. Deliberate development is essential throughout
an Airman’s career and satisfied through education on institutional
competencies, training on functional competencies, a varied array of
experiential opportunities, and force developmental tools. When developing
Airmen, what is essential is to ensure they take full advantage of the abundant
opportunities and resources that exist both functionally and institutionally.
What is imperative from an enterprise perspective, is to look at how Airmen
progress through their career fields and then into operational and strategic
leadership positions. </p>

<p class="msonormal109">9.17.1. Functionally, the Air Force develops
technical experts through career field progression and succession planning.
From the earliest stages of their careers, Airmen and their supervisors must
comprehend the progression path for technical and professional development. In
the majority of career fields, the progression roadmap and developmental
pyramid provide sufficient direction to produce Airmen qualified for their
current duties and for future responsibilities. Incumbent upon Career Field
Managers is to routinely review their progression strategy to ensure their
career field’s technical requirements are being satisfied. </p>

<p class="msonormal110">9.17.2. Institutionally, we strive to develop
experienced leaders. As Airmen demonstrate expertise and potential, they should
be encouraged to take on more responsibility and increased leadership roles.
Developmental opportunities such as deployments, joint assignments and
headquarters staff assignments offer a unique perspective on how the Air Force
functions. Furthermore, special duty assignments provide skills and insight
beneficial to an Airman’s future capabilities. </p>

<p class="msonormal109">9.17.3. Additionally, educational opportunities exist
throughout an Airman’s career which contribute to individual overall
development. Enlisted Professional Military Education, developmental education,
civilian education and other <span class="grame">selfimprovement</span> programs
such as the United States Air Force Library Digital Media Program and Air Force
Credentialing Opportunities On-Line enhance the knowledge and capabilities of
Airmen. </p>

<p class="msonormal108">9.17.4. Effective career progression and Airman
Development are dependent upon frank conversations between supervisors and
subordinates regarding career field and institutional requirements, personal
qualifications and goals, and available developmental opportunities. Routine
counseling and performance feedback sessions should include these discussions. </p>

<p class="msonormal57"><b class="calibre1">9.18.
Enlisted Force Development Oversight:<i class="calibre2"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal96">9.18.1.<b class="calibre1">
The Enlisted Force Development Panel. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal106">The Enlisted Force Development Panel is responsible
for guiding enlisted force development initiatives. The Enlisted Force Development
Panel is charged to review, evaluate, and make recommendations to senior Air
Force leaders regarding concerns, programs and initiatives relating to the
education, training and experiences impacting enlisted Airman Development. The
Enlisted Force Development Panel is hosted by the Chief, Enlisted Force
Development and co-chaired by the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force and
the Director, Force Development (Air Force/A1D). Panel members include Command
Chief Master Sergeants from the combatant command and major command level as
well as from the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard.
Additionally, there are Career Field Managers and representatives from Air
Education Training Command, Air University, Second Air Force, Basic Military
Training, Air Force Personnel Center and Headquarters Air Force. A former Chief
Master Sergeant of the Air Force attends as a strategic advisor. </p>

<p class="msonormal57"><b class="calibre1">9.19.
Enlisted Force Development Tools. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal107">In 2010, the Enlisted Force Development Panel
recommended initiating Enlisted Development Teams to enable the enlisted force
to deliberately develop senior enlisted leaders. According to Chief Master
Sergeant of the Air Force James A. Roy, "The purpose of deliberate
development is to grow our senior noncommissioned officers and grow the next
generation of senior enlisted leaders to meet the highly technical and very
complex leadership challenges the Department of Defense and the United States
Air Force face in the future."<span class="calibre26"> </span>In 2011, pilot Enlisted
Development Teams were established in eight career fields, focusing on
specialties associated with the nuclear enterprise. In 2012, Air Force/A1 and
the Vice Chief of Staff approved Enlisted Development Teams for all Air Force
specialty codes, with execution across the enlisted force expected to be
complete by 2017. Enlisted Development Teams are designed to leverage the
development of qualified Airmen with the leadership capacity and acculturation
necessary to support current and projected mission requirements. Career Field
Managers use Enlisted Development Teams to perform progression and succession
planning to place Airmen in key leadership and developmental positions based on
defined education, training, experience and performance requirements. Placing
“the right people in the right place at the right time” is imperative. </p>

<p class="msonormal96">9.19.1.<b class="calibre1">
<span class="grame">MyVECTOR</span>. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal103">Formerly known as the Career Path Tool, <span class="grame">MyVECTOR</span> is a Total Force, force development, experience

Chief of Staff of the Air Force development priorities. <span class="grame">MyVECTOR</span>
is a web-based career planning and force development tool which allows
individuals greater transparency into their development and career management.
In addition to being the enterprise information technology tool used to support
Career Field Managers and development teams, <span class="grame">MyVECTOR</span>
also offers robust mentoring capabilities. The reconfigured online platform has
a modern look and feel, with the new configuration supporting not only the

Enlisted Career Path Pyramid. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal99">The Enlisted Career Pyramid (Figure 9.5) is a display of
training, education, and experience which enlisted Airmen will encounter

Institutional Competencies. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal101">Institutional competencies prepare Airmen to operate
successfully across the widest array of Air Force tasks and requirements. These
competencies provide a common language and a set of priorities for consistency
across the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal105">The Air <span class="grame">Force‘</span>s
institutional competencies are key to ensuring the ability of Airmen to operate
successfully in a constantly changing operational environment. They are broadly
applicable and span all occupations, functions, and organizational levels.
These competencies place the institutional responsibilities into a context of
how the individual should be developed and form the framework for force
development in the Air Force. The institutional competency list consists of 8
competencies and 25 sub-competencies. They are grouped into three categories:
personal, people/team, and organizational. 9.20.1.<b class="calibre1"> Personal
Competencies.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal100">Personal competencies (Figure 9.6) are those
institutional competencies leaders need in face-to-face and interpersonal
relationships that directly influence human behavior and values. These are
foundational institutional competencies learned at the tactical level that will
continue to play a critical role as leaders move to the operational competence
and strategic vision levels. Personal competencies are essential for individual
contribution, for building cohesive units and for empowering immediate
subordinates. Each competency below is followed by the relevant <span class="grame">subcompetencies</span> with definitions. </p>

<p class="msonormal104">These competencies (Figure 9.8) represent those
applicable at all levels of the Air Force but are most in demand at the
strategic level. Strategic leaders apply organizational competencies to
establish structure and articulate strategic vision. Effective organizational
competency skills include technical competence on force structure and
integration; on unified, joint, multinational, and interagency operations; on
resource allocation; and on management of complex systems. In addition, they
apply to conceptual competence in creating policy and vision and interpersonal
skills emphasizing consensus building and influencing peers and other policy
makers, both internal and external to the organization. This level is the nexus
of warfighting leadership skills for the Air Force. Also, this level is
achieved through having learned the lessons from the other types of
institutional competencies (i.e., personal and people/team). Each competency

An Airman’s Perspective </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal57"><b class="calibre1">9.21.
America’s Guardians:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal108">9.21.1. Since the Nation’s birth, our military has
had the constitutional duty to ensure national survival, defend lives and
property, and promote vital interest at home and abroad. To provide for the common
defense, all of America’s military services strive for excellence in how they
organize, train, and equip their forces to fight and win the Nation’s wars. All
are vital, interdependent components of a mighty joint team, united by a
tradition of honor, valor, and devotion. </p>

<p class="msonormal156">9.21.2. The Air Force exists to fly, fight, and win
to achieve strategic, operational, and tactical objectives unhindered by time,
distance, or geography. The Air Force’s mission is to “deliver sovereign
options for the defense of the United States of America and global interests<b class="calibre1">—</b>to
fly and fight in Air, Space, and Cyberspace.” Thereby, jointly with our
brothers and sisters in arms—Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen—we
underwrite the strategy of defending the homeland and assuring allies, while
dissuading, deterring, and defeating enemies. </p>

<p class="msonormal57"><b class="calibre1">9.22.
Professionalism or Profession of Arms.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal101">No profession asks more of their members than the
Profession of Arms. We are warriors, we have answered our Nation’s call; no one
puts more on the line to defend freedom than the men and women of the United
States Armed Forces. </p>

<p class="msonormal157"><i class="calibre2">As members of the joint team, we
Airmen are part of a unique profession that is founded on the premise of
service before self. We are not engaged in just another job; we are
practitioners of the profession of arms. We are entrusted with the security of
our Nation, the protection of our citizens, and the preservation of its way of
life. In this capacity, we serve as guardians of America’s future. By its very
nature, this responsibility requires us to place the needs of our service and
our country before personal concerns. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal158"><i class="calibre2">Our military profession is
sharply distinguished from others by what General Sir John Hackett has termed
the “unlimited liability clause.” Upon entering the Air Force, we accept a
sacred trust from the American people. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal159"><i class="calibre2">We swear to support and defend
the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and
domestic. We take this obligation freely without any reservations. We thereby
commit our lives in defense of America and her citizens should that become
necessary. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal160"><i class="calibre2">No other profession readily
expects its members to lay down their lives for their friends, families, or
freedoms. But our profession readily expects its members to willingly risk
their lives in performing their professional duties. By voluntarily serving in
the military profession, we accept unique responsibilities.  </i></p>

<p class="msonormal161"><i class="calibre2">Inherent in all this is the
individual’s willingness to subordinate personal interests for the good of
one’s unit, one’s Service, and one’s Nation. We can ill afford individuals who
become “sunshine soldiers” or get focused on careerism. Instead, we need
professionals who strive to be the best at their current job and who realize
they attain individual advancement through the success of their unit or work
center. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal162">General Ronald R. <span class="grame">Fogleman</span>
Former Air Force Chief of Staff  </p>

<p class="msonormal57"><b class="calibre1">9.23.
The Airman’s Perspective:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal163">9.23.1. Throughout our history, the Air Force has always
had a perspective or mindset different than the surface components of national
military power, and this is based on a long history of lessons learned in peace
and war. Specifically, airpower in application is fundamentally different from
other forms of military power. Second, inherent flexibility allows the force to
be applied independently or in concert with other forms of military power.
Third, can be most effective if applied for the right reasons and in the right
concentrations at the right time and place to achieve effects on the
battlefield. Therefore, since Air Force forces are employed differently, in
different mediums, at different speeds and closure rates and over greater
distances. These forces must be applied by those who truly appreciate the
breadth and scope in the application of that power. Finally, Airman should have
fluent knowledge of these aspects of Air Force capabilities. </p>

<p class="msonormal164">9.23.2. Airmen are essential to the Air Force
institution and the successful execution of their mission. To understand and
actively advocate the Airman’s perspective on the use of airpower to achieve
objectives as directed by proper authority is important. All Airmen share the
same goal—to accomplish their organization’s mission. In order to defend the
United States and global interests, Airmen should be prepared to fly and fight
in air, space, and cyberspace. Using the Airman’s perspective gives Airmen a
distinctive advantage when performing this mission of the Air Force. Airmen
bring not only knowledge, skills, and abilities that allow them to accomplish
this mission, but a manner of approaching mission accomplishment unique to
those educated, trained, and experienced in bringing <span class="grame">airmindedness</span>
to all actions they perform. An Airman brings a perspective to performing the
Service’s mission that compounds his or her effectiveness in a manner best
suited to support a commander. </p>

<p class="msonormal163">9.23.3. Upon entering the Air Force, members take an
oath signifying their personal commitment to support and defend the
Constitution of the United States and a commitment and willingness to serve
their country for the duration of their Air Force career. The oath is a solemn
promise to do one’s duty and meet one’s responsibilities. The oath espouses the
responsibility to lead others in the exercise of one’s duty. </p>

<p class="msonormal108">9.23.4. Building warrior leaders who have the
competencies and skills to understand the complexity of expeditionary
operations and the successful execution of airpower capabilities in unilateral,
joint, or coalition operations is a responsibility shared by the Air Force and
individual Airmen. Also, Airmen must be able to use scarce resources
effectively to deliver required air, space, and cyberspace effects. The
development of this warrior ethos is an individual and organizational responsibility.
</p>

<p class="msonormal156">9.23.5. When Air Force forces are employed in various
operational environments, they offer basic characteristics that, when
exploited, are fundamental to the successful conduct of war and peace. These
characteristics, when molded into viable force capabilities and executed by
knowledge-enabled Airmen, enhance the overall ability of the joint team to
achieve success when called upon. Therefore, each Airman should understand and
be able to articulate the full potential and application of Air Force capabilities
required to support the Air Force mission and meet United States national
security objectives. </p>

<p class="msonormal57"><b class="calibre1">9.24.
The Warrior Ethos:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal164">9.24.1. The central focus of the profession of arms
is warfighting. As Airmen, we have a special responsibility to ensure the most
lethal Air Force the world has ever seen flies and fights the right way. Airmen
have inherited an Air Force forged through the ingenuity, courage, and strength
of Airmen who preceded them. An Airman’s duty is to continue to provide the
Nation and the next generation of Airmen an equally dominant Air Force. Doing
so requires Airmen to fully understand the profession of arms they have chosen,
the commitment they made by taking an oath of office, and the acceptance to
live according to the Air Force’s core values. This is the warrior ethos and a
mindset designed to build the confidence and commitment necessary to shape
professional Airmen able to work as a team to accomplish the mission. This
mindset is shaped by an expeditionary service during combat, humanitarian
response, disaster relief operations, and by the lessons learned from those
operations. The warrior ethos is also developed and sustained over the course
of a career through a continuum of learning and associated development
experiences, including a wide variety of assignments, focused training and
education, exhibiting pride in the Air Force uniform, physical conditioning,
and understanding Air Force symbols, history, and culture.  </p>

<p class="msonormal101">9.24.2. Airmen share a history of service, honor, and sacrifice.
From the earliest days of airpower to the heights of space, </p>

<p class="msonormal163">Airmen have built an extraordinary heritage that
forms the foundation for the Service’s boundless horizon. Even though we are
technology focused, we value quality over quantity. We embrace change and
through transformation and innovation ensure a viable Air Force for the future.
Airmen firmly grounded in the core values and ingrained with the warrior ethos
react to combat stresses, operational deployment pressures, and daily home
station demands with valor, courage, and sacrifice. We all have these
characteristics, which surface often during times of great difficulty or
unforeseen circumstances. While many acts of valor, courage or sacrifice go
unseen, others helped shape the finest traditions of the Air Force. They should
be recognized not only as part of United States Air Force history, but also to
illustrate that any Airman may be called upon to perform above and beyond in
the profession of arms. </p>

<p class="msonormal57"><b class="calibre1">9.25.
Valor.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal156">Valor is the ability to face danger or hardship in a
determined and resolute manner and is commonly known as bravery, fearlessness,
fortitude, gallantry, heart, nerve, and many other terms. Valor is the
willingness to step outside of one’s comfort zone to deal with an unexpected
situation. Such situations can happen almost anywhere. Valor exists in places
other than on the battlefield; an Airman can exhibit valor when presented with
unusual circumstances in the daily routine of life. When acting with valor, one
expresses the qualities of a hero or heroine.<i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal157"><i class="calibre2">In the summer of 2005, Senior
Airman <span class="grame">Shea</span> Dodson wanted to do more than his
assigned administrative duties inside of Baghdad’s Green Zone. The call was out
for volunteers to provide security for ongoing convoys, so Airman Dodson raised
his hand. After some intense just-in-time training, he was performing security
detail for his first convoy. On this mission, Airman Dodson put that training
to good use. When a suspected vehicle-borne suicide bomber raced toward the
convoy, he fired .50 caliber rounds into the engine block no fewer than four
times, disabling the vehicle. During the same mission, his unit became mired in
traffic near a high-rise development. He noticed movement above and saw an
Iraqi armed with an AK-47 creeping toward the edge of a balcony overlooking the
convoy. Airman Dodson immediately engaged with indirect warning fire from his
M-16, hitting the wall next to the suspected insurgent’s head. The armed Iraqi
dove for cover and never returned. When the convoy arrived at its final
destination, a children’s school, he continued with a complete security sweep
of the perimeter houses to ensure it was clear. Airman Dodson remained on armed
watch as his team handed out school supplies to the kids in the open courtyard.
By 2 PM that same day, Airman Dodson was back at his desk, keeping track of
critical data for the commanding general of the Multinational Security
Transition Command–Iraq. It was all in a day’s work for this dedicated Airman. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal57"><b class="calibre1">9.26.
Courage.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal171">Courage
is about the ability to face fear, danger, or adversity. Three types of courage
are critical in the profession of arms: </p>

<p class="msonormal172">personal, physical, and moral. Personal courage is
about doing what’s right even at risk to one’s career. Physical courage is the
ability to overcome fears of bodily harm to get the job done, or willingness to
risk yourself for someone else’s sake in battle or the course of everyday life.
Finally, moral courage is the ability to stand by the core values when moral
courage may not be the popular thing to do. Integrity breeds courage when and
where the behavior is most needed. More often than not, courage is manifested
as an act of bravery on the battlefield as Airmen face the challenges present
in combat. </p>

<p class="msonormal173"><i class="calibre2">While on a special mission in
Southwest Asia in 2005, Technical Sergeant Corey <span class="grame">Clewley</span>
was loading cargo on his aircraft when he saw a Romanian C-130 experience a
hard landing. Unbeknownst to the Romanian crew, the aircraft brakes caused a
fire, causing Sergeant <span class="grame">Clewley</span> to spring into action.
He instructed a fellow loadmaster to inform his aircraft commander of the
situation and to ensure that someone contacted the control tower of the fire
while he and a crew chief grabbed fire extinguishers and ran toward the burning
aircraft. The Romanian C-130 fire intensified as it spread to the aircraft’s
fuselage and ruptured the hydraulic brake line. Despite the danger to himself,
Sergeant <span class="grame">Clewley</span> got within a few feet of the flames
and attempted to suppress the fire. His sense of urgency tripled when he
realized the C130 crew was still inside the aircraft and was unable to get out
of the burning aircraft. He saw a member of the crew mouthing ‘please, please’
and pointing to the troop exit door. Sergeant <span class="grame">Clewley</span>
refocused his attention to that area and began suppressing the fire, enabling
the crew to safely exit the aircraft. He continued to keep the fire under
control until the fire department arrived. Sergeant <span class="grame">Clewley</span>
credits the team effort that kept the incident from becoming a deadly event and
never considered the risk to his own life as he worked to save a crew and
aircraft that was not part of his responsibility, his service, or even his
Nation. He noted that saving the lives of the people on board was more
important than who owned the aircraft. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal165">Quotations from the Air Force Memorial in Washington,
District of Columbia<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal57"><b class="calibre1">9.27.
Sacrifice:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal164">9.27.1. Sacrifice involves a willingness to give your
life, time, or comfort to meet others' needs. Personal sacrifice occurs on many
levels, but is commonly evident in the heroic actions of Airmen in combat.
Day-to-day deployed garrison activities also present opportunities to put
others' needs before individual wants. </p>

<p class="msonormal157"><i class="calibre2">Everyday people can confront
their fears, pains and uncertainties with courage or cower to the daily
decisions facing them. Just being here (at <span class="grame">Manas</span> Air
Base), you have overcome many challenges with your courage that helped prepare
you to contribute to your Nation in tangible ways. You faced basic training,
skills training, and deployment to <span class="grame">a location worlds</span>
away from your normal life. All have taken courage and prepared you for the
impact you are making…your decisions, your actions, your sacrifices of the
luxuries of home, friends, and family do make a difference. Every day, the
Airmen of <span class="grame">Manas</span>, from Airman Basic to Colonel, make
decisions that have an impact on the Global War on Terrorism! Without the
contributions of the individual soldier who pays the price to secure freedom
for the many, the mission does not get done. Simply put…because Airmen have
courage…because Airmen make sacrifices…because Airmen are not intimidated by

Senior Airman Jason Cunningham, an Air Force <span class="grame"><span class="grame">pararescueman</span></span><span class="grame">  performed</span>
actions during Operation Enduring Freedom that earned him the thanks of a
grateful Nation, at the cost of his life. The Air Force Cross is awarded to
United States and Foreign military personnel and civilians who have displayed
extraordinary heroism in one of the following situations: while engaged in
action against a United States enemy, while engaged in military operations
involving conflict with a foreign force, or while serving with a Friendly
nation engaged in armed conflict against a force in which the United States is
not a belligerent party. The Air Force Cross is awarded when the heroic actions
fall just short of warranting the Congressional Medal of Honor. Only 24 Airmen
have been awarded the Air Force Cross, the service’s highest award, and only
two, including Cunningham have received the award since the end of the Vietnam
War. Below is the citation for Senior Airman Jason Cunningham’s Air Force
Cross. </p>

  <p class="msonormal181">(POSTHUMOUS) TO </p>
  <p class="msonormal182">JASON D. CUNNINGHAM </p>
  <p class="msonormal183">The President of the
  United States of America, authorized by Title 10, Section 8742, U.S.C.,
  awards the Air Force Cross to Senior Airman Jason D. Cunningham for
  extraordinary heroism in military operations against an opposing armed force
  while serving as a <span class="grame">pararescueman</span> near the village
  of <span class="grame">Marzak</span> in the <span class="grame">Paktia</span>
  Province of Afghanistan on 4 March 2002. On that proud day, Airman Cunningham
  was the primary Air Force Combat Search and Rescue medic assigned to a Quick
  Reaction Force tasked to recover two American servicemen evading capture in
  austere terrain occupied by massed Al Qaida and Taliban forces. Shortly
  before landing, his MH-47E helicopter received accurate rocket-propelled
  grenade and small arms fire, severely disabling the aircraft and causing it
  to crash land. The assault force formed a hasty defense and immediately
  suffered three fatalities and five critical casualties. Despite effective
  enemy fire, and at great risk to his own life, Airman Cunningham remained in
  the burning fuselage of the aircraft in order to treat the wounded. As he
  moved his patients to a more secure location, mortar rounds began to impact
  within fifty feet of his position. Disregarding this extreme danger, he
  continued the movement and exposed himself to enemy fire on seven separate
  occasions. When the second casualty collection point was also compromised, in
  a display of uncommon valor and gallantry, Airman Cunningham braved an intense
  small arms and rocket-propelled grenade attack while repositioning the
  critically wounded to a third collection point. Even after he was mortally
  wounded and quickly deteriorating, he continued to direct patient movement
  and transferred care to another medic. In the end, his distinct efforts led
  to the successful delivery of ten gravely wounded Americans to life-saving
  medical treatment. Through his extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship,
  aggressiveness in the face of the enemy, and in the dedication of his service
  to his country, Senior Airman Cunningham reflected the highest credit upon
  himself and the United States Air Force. </p>

Profession of Arms Conclusion: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal184">9.28.1. We must remember that above all else, we are
Airmen first. We, more than anyone else, understand the price that is paid for
freedom. Airmen, more than anyone else, understand the sacrifices that come
from willingly serving our country. Finally, Airmen more than anyone else,
understand the meaning of belonging to the Profession of Arms. </p>

<p class="msonormal185">9.28.2. We must learn from history. Our shared
touchstone of warrior virtues and single, unifying purpose remain unchanged:
fly, fight, and win. We must remain true to the legacy of valor and devotion,
so boldly written with contrails and smoke across the skies from Ploesti and
Schweinfurt, through MiG Alley and downtown Hanoi, to Kandahar and Baghdad.
This legacy defines our role in the American way of war—to risk the lives of
Airmen to kick down the opponent’s door so thousands need not die. </p>

Readiness: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal101">9.29.1. One of the telltale signs of a military
professional is preparation. When the time comes to use their skills, military professionals
are ready because they took advantage of opportunities to gain experience.
Every military member will have opportunities to serve. Those opportunities may
be mundane, exciting, or inconvenient, but each will provide a chance to gain
experience and improve readiness levels. </p>

<p class="msonormal109">9.29.2. Often, opportunities to serve do not look
particularly exciting or rewarding, but they hold the seeds of greatness. Doing
such tasks builds the experience level needed to sharpen judgment and
discernment. Military members should be open to a variety of experiences in
order to grow in all areas of life (physical, mental, emotional, and
spiritual). Military professionals cannot be disconnected from the world and
must remember that the cost of choosing one path may be the opportunity to take
another. </p>

<p class="msonormal110">9.29.3. The military professional who stands ready to
make critical decisions and is able to perform under pressure is usually the
one who took advantage of unique opportunities that arose. From past
experiences, professionals build the confidence, judgment, courage, and
integrity they need to act professionally. Will they always feel ready?
Probably not, but most will likely say they wish they had more experience upon
which to base their decisions or improve their performance. Most experience is
gained by accepting opportunities as they come, even when conditions are not
perfect. </p>

<p class="msonormal164">9.29.4. Certainly, no one can do everything. Members
must select wisely to prevent overloading and burnout. They can round out their
perspective vicariously by sharing others’ experiences through reading.
Charles, Archduke of Austria, pointed to this thought when he said, “A great
captain can be formed only by long experience and intense study; neither is his
own experience enough—for whose life is…sufficiently fruitful of events to
render his knowledge universal?” </p>

Chief of Staff, United States Air Force Professional Reading Program: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal164">9.30.1. In 1996, General <span class="grame">Fogleman</span>
created the Chief of Staff, United States Air Force Professional Reading Program
to develop a common frame of reference among Air Force members—officers,
enlisted, and civilians—to help each become better, more effective advocates of
air and space power. Each Chief of Staff, United States Air Force since then
has enhanced and continued the Chief of Staff, United States Air Force’s
Professional Reading Program. In 2012, General Norton A. Schwartz revised the
list by adding books; films; technology, entertainment, design briefings; and
online resources. </p>

<p class="msonormal164">9.30.2. This program can help launch a career-long
reading habit or be used to supplement previous readings. Listed materials
cover various topics, although the majority detail air and space power from its
genesis to recent times. These sources provide great examples of leadership to illustrate
qualities Airmen should emulate. The list includes insight into Air Force
history, analyze ongoing conflicts and their relevancy to the future, furnish
organizational and leadership success stories, and provide lessons learned from
recent conflicts. The more you study, the better you will understand the
background behind the Air Force’s core competencies and the better equipped you
will be to form and express your own opinions. </p>

<p class="msonormal164">9.30.3. The Headquarters Air Force Historian (HQ
USAF/HO) is responsible for day-to-day management of the reading list. The
reading list is particularly relevant as civilian men and women take on more
responsibility in these times of global terrorism and international conflict.
Most of the books were chosen because of their readability. Their selection
does not reflect Chief of Staff, United States Air Force or United States Air
Force endorsement of the authors’ views or interpretations. Access the updated
reading list and a brief summary of new selections at </p>

supply each Air Force library with multiple copies of each new book on the
list.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal57"><b class="calibre1">9.31.
Core Values: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal164">9.31.1. Core values are at the heart and soul of the
military profession: <i class="calibre2">integrity first, service before self, and excellence in
all we do. </i>Such values are closely intertwined since integrity provides the
bedrock for our military endeavors, and is fortified by service to country.
This in turn fuels the drive for excellence. In light of the demands placed
upon our people to support United States security interests around the globe,
the concept of “service before self” needs further discussion. As members of
the joint team, Airmen are part of a unique profession founded on the premise
of service before self. Airmen are not engaged in just another job: they are
practitioners of the profession of arms. They are entrusted with the security
of the Nation, the protection of their citizens, and the preservation of their
way of life. In this capacity, they serve as guardians of America’s future, and
this responsibility requires Airmen to place the needs of service and country
before personal concerns. </p>

<p class="msonormal188">9.31.2. The military profession is sharply
distinguished from others by what General Sir John Hackett has termed the
“unlimited liability clause.” Upon entering the Air Force, Airmen accept a
sacred trust from the American people. They swear to support and defend the
Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
They take this obligation freely without any reservations and thereby commit
their lives in defense of America and their citizens. </p>

<p class="msonormal101">9.31.3. No other profession expects their members to lay
down their lives for their friends, families, or freedoms. By voluntarily
serving in the military profession, Airmen accept unique responsibilities. In
today’s world, service to country requires not only a high degree of skill, but
also a willingness to make personal sacrifices. Airmen work long hours to
provide the most combat capability possible for the taxpayer dollar. Military
professional’s duties require them to go temporary duty or permanent change of
station to harsh locations to meet national security needs; are on call 24
hours a day, 7 days a week; and when called, deploy to the far corners of the
globe without complaint. </p>

<p class="msonormal156">9.31.4. Inherent in all of this is individual willingness
to subordinate personal interests for the good of the unit, Service, and
Nation. Airmen can ill afford “sunshine soldiers,” or those who focus on
careerism. Instead, the military needs professionals who strive to be the best
at their current job, and who realize they attain individual advancement
through the success of their unit or work center. Careerism can be most
damaging in the case of leaders. If subordinates perceive leaders are consumed
with career concerns, they will be unwilling to forgo personal goals for the
good of the unit and the Air Force. This situation is only aggravated by
attempts to serve “through a position” or to do a quick “touch and go” in a key
job simply to fill out a resume. Ultimately, the mission will suffer with potentially
devastating consequences. </p>

<p class="msonormal164">9.31.5. So, what is the payoff for placing service
before self? The paycheck or the benefits is not what keeps the professionals
going. Professionals remain with the Air Force because of the intangibles: the
satisfaction gained from doing something significant with their lives, the
pride in being part of a unique organization that lives by high standards, and
the sense of accomplishment gained from defending the Nation and their
democratic way of life. </p>

<p class="msonormal57"><b class="calibre1">9.32.
Conclusion: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal164">9.32.1. This chapter discusses the philosophy,
purpose, and structure of the enlisted force and examines the NCO in terms of
rank and precedence, legal authority, and general and specific
responsibilities. <span class="grame">Also</span> briefly described is the
special positions of trust senior NCOs may hold, such as Air Force career filed
manager, first sergeant, Command Chief Master Sergeant, and Chief Master
Sergeant of the Air Force, and concludes with a discussion of the profession of
arms. </p>

<p class="msonormal108">9.32.2. The word “professional” should inspire all
enlisted members to aspire to the ideal of service and expertise. Professional
status comes to people at different times in their lives and careers.
Furthermore, professionalism is achieved through continuous study, practice,
and experience. Overall, the military seems to fit strongly into the
professional category, but at what point can an individual claim professional
military status? Professional status is expressed by attitudes and commitments,
and by internalizing military values. Studying and understanding these factors
are vital to the senior NCO and the future of the United States Air Force.
Every senior NCO has an obligation to the United States, to the Air Force, and
to his or her supervisor and subordinates to be the very best professional
possible. </p>

<p class="msonormal164">9.32.3. Future military members must educate
themselves through study, experience, and by observing others. They must learn
to accept responsibility for their actions and those of their subordinates, and
to take appropriate action, never hiding behind excuses. Their focus must be on
devoted service to the Nation, not on pay, working conditions, or their next
assignment. Only then will they move toward achieving the ideal of
professionalism.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

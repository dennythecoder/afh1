<p class="msonormal"><b class="calibre1">Chapter 9 </b></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre1">THE NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER </b></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 9A—Overview </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">9.1.
Introduction: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">9.1.1. Noncommissioned officers (NCO) are the backbone of
the Air Force. The organization’s success or failure, strengths or weaknesses can
be directly related to the effectiveness of its NCOs. This chapter begins by
discussing the philosophy, purpose, and structure of the enlisted force. Next,
it explores the ranks, roles, responsibilities and developmental levels for
Junior Enlisted Airmen, NCOs and senior noncommissioned officers. In addition,
it briefly describes those special positions entrusted to senior NCO, such as
Air Force Career Field Manager, first sergeant, Command Chief Master Sergeant,
and Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">9.1.2. Regardless of rank, every enlisted Airman
supports the Profession of Arms to defend the interests of the state, by force
and death, when required. This charge is unique to the military profession, and
is a calling that requires devotion to service and willingness to sacrifice far
beyond that required in other professions. The military as a profession and its
core values and supporting ideas are concepts that epitomize the “NCO.”
Finally, the purpose for including this chapter within AFH 1, <i class="calibre2">Airman</i> is
to provide enlisted Airmen reference material to support their promotion tests.<b class="calibre1">
</b></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 9B—The Enlisted Force
Structure </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">9.2.
Philosophy: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">9.2.1. The enlisted force is a diverse corps of
functionally and operationally specialized Airmen in the Profession of Arms.
Despite the differences across functional and operational lines, there is a
compelling need for a deliberate and common approach to force development,
career progression, and the assumption of increased supervisory and leadership
responsibilities. To best leverage our <span class="grame">resources</span> we
must have a consistent, well-defined set of expectations, standards, and
opportunities for growth for <i class="calibre2">all </i>Airmen, regardless of rank or
specialty. The enlisted force structure provides this consistency and common
approach. It defines us as <i class="calibre2">Airmen first</i>, <i class="calibre2">specialists second</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">9.2.2. All elements of the enlisted force structure
reflect the Air Force core values (Integrity First, Service Before Self, and
Excellence in All We Do), and are essential to the profession of arms. The core
values are the basis for Air Force policies, guidance, and overall focus. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">9.3.
Purpose of the Force Structure: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal8">9.3.1. The enlisted force structure provides the framework
for a force structure that best meets mission requirements, while developing
institutional and occupational competencies. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">9.3.2. The enlisted force structure defines the tiers,
ranks, terms of address, roles, expectations, key positions and approved duty
titles for the enlisted force. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">9.3.3. Additionally, the enlisted force structure provides a
framework for supervisors as they set standards during initial feedback
sessions, evaluate progress during mid-term feedback sessions, and document
performance on annual reports. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">9.4.
Air Force Leadership Levels. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">9.4.1. The Air Force operates in a dynamic global context
across multiple domains requiring leadership skills at three distinct levels:
tactical expertise, operational competence, and strategic vision. These levels
emphasize a different mix of qualities and experience. The leadership level at
which an Airman operates determines the institutional competencies (see
paragraph 9.20) required to lead Airmen in mission accomplishment. As shown in
Figure 9.1, as Airmen progress from the tactical expertise to strategic vision
leadership levels, emphasis on the use of institutional competencies shifts
from personal to organizational, with a generally consistent focus on
people/team competencies. The nature and scope of leadership challenges as well
as preferred leadership methods differ based on the level of leadership and
duties. In addition, these levels apply across the entire spectrum of the
enlisted force structure (Figure 9.2). </p>

<p class="msonormal9">9.4.2.
<b class="calibre1">Tactical Expertise Level. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">This level is predominantly direct and face-to-face
and focused on personal competencies. At the tactical expertise level, Airmen
gain a general understanding of team leadership and an appreciation for
organization leadership. They master their core duty skills, develop
experiences in applying those skills, and begin to acquire the knowledge and
experience that will produce the qualities essential to effective leadership.
Airmen at the tactical expertise level gain the training, education and
experience to become the Air Force’s primary technicians and specialists. They
learn about themselves as leaders and how their leadership acumen can affect
others through the use of ethical leadership. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">They assimilate into the Air Force culture and adopt the
Air Force Core Values. Airmen at this level focus on honing followership
abilities, motivating subordinates and influencing peers to accomplish the
mission while developing a warrior ethos. They learn about themselves and their
impact on others in roles as both follower and leader in addition to developing
their communication skills. The primary focus at the tactical expertise level
is accomplishing the missions as effectively and efficiently as possible using
available personnel and resources.  </p>

<p class="msonormal9">9.4.3.
<b class="calibre1">Operational Competence Level. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">The full-spectrum of institutional competencies is balanced
across the operational competence leadership level. At this level, Airmen
understand the broader Air Force perspective and the integration of diverse
people and capabilities in operational execution. They transition from
specialists to leaders with a broader enterprise perspective who understand Air
Force operational capabilities. Based on a thorough understanding of themselves
as leaders and followers, Airmen apply an understanding of organizational and
team dynamics. They lead teams by developing and inspiring others, taking care
of people, and taking advantage of diversity. They foster collaborative
relationships through building teams and coalitions, especially within large
organizations, and negotiate with others, often external to the organization.
Airmen operating at this leadership level normally work below the major command
or Headquarters Air Force levels. The majority of enlisted Airmen operate at
the tactical expertise and operational competence levels. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">9.4.4. <b class="calibre1">Strategic
Vision Level.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal18">At this level, Airmen combine highly developed
personal and people/team institutional competencies to apply broad
organizational competencies. They develop a deep understanding of Air Force
capabilities and how Airmen achieve synergistic results and desired effects
with their operational capabilities. They also understand how the Air Force
operates within joint, multinational, and interagency relationships. At the
strategic vision level, an Airman employs military capabilities, applying the
operational and strategic arts with a thorough understanding of unit
capabilities, the Air Force at large, and joint and coalition forces. They have
an enterprise perspective with a thorough understanding of the structure and
relationships needed to accomplish strategic objectives. The strategic vision
level focuses on the effects an Airman can have across a major command, a
theater, the Air Force, or even other Services or the Department of Defense.
The Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force (CMSAF) and few other senior NCOs
assigned to higher headquarters operate at this level. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">9.5.
Enlisted Force Structure Tiers, Ranks and Roles. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">The enlisted force structure is comprised of three
distinct and separate tiers, each correlating to increased levels of education,
training, and experience, which build increasing levels of proficiency. The
tiers are Junior Enlisted Airmen, Noncommissioned Officer, and Senior
Noncommissioned Officer, with multiple ranks in each tier. Each rank includes
an official abbreviation and term of address, as outlined below. Unofficial
terms for ranks are not appropriate terms of address (e.g., Tech, Senior,
etc.); however, Airmen senior or equivalent to the member may use first names
and/or call signs. The three tiers correlate to increased leadership and
managerial responsibilities, with each tier building on the responsibilities of
the previous one. Therefore, senior NCOs are expected to have mastered NCO
responsibilities. Likewise, NCOs are expected to have mastered Junior Enlisted
Airmen responsibilities. The primary goal in each tier is mission
accomplishment. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">9.5.1.
<b class="calibre1">The Junior Enlisted Airman Tier. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal19">This tier consists of airman basic, airman,
airman first class, and senior airman. Initial enlisted accessions enter the
Air Force in this tier (airman basic, airman, or airman first class), and focus
on adapting to military requirements, being part of the profession of arms,
achieving occupational proficiency, and learning how to be highly productive
members of the Air Force. In this tier, Airmen prepare for increased
responsibilities and ensure they are trained, qualified, and ready to operate,
both at home station and in an expeditionary environment. Junior Enlisted
Airmen are introduced to the institutional competencies and continue to broaden
their technical skills.  </p>

<p class="msonormal20">9.5.1.1. <b class="calibre1">Airman Basic and newly
enlisted Airmen.</b> Airmen basics, as well as Airmen who initially enlist into
the Air Force at the airman or airman first class rank, are primarily adapting
to the requirements of the military profession, acquiring knowledge of military
customs, courtesies, and Air Force standards, as well as striving to attain
occupational proficiency. At their first duty station, they perform basic tasks
under close supervision. The written abbreviation for airman basic is “AB” and
the official term of address is “Airman Basic” or “Airman.” </p>

<p class="msonormal19">9.5.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Airman.</b> Airmen are still
learning and adapting to the military profession, and are expected to
understand and conform to military standards, customs, and courtesies. Airmen
begin to show occupational proficiency at basic tasks and still require
significant supervision and support. The written abbreviation is “<span class="grame">Amn</span>” and the official term of address is “Airman.” </p>

<p class="msonormal20">9.5.1.3. <b class="calibre1">Airman First Class.</b>
Airmen first class fully comply with Air Force standards and devote time to
increasing their skills in their career fields and the military profession,
while becoming effective team members. After a short time at their first duty
station, they are often skilled on numerous tasks. Continued supervision is
essential to ongoing occupational and professional growth. Typically, the
5-skill level is earned at this grade. The written abbreviation is “A1C” and
the official term of address is “Airman First Class” or “Airman.”<span class="calibre6"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal21">9.5.1.4. <b class="calibre1">Senior Airman.</b> Senior airmen
commonly perform as skilled technicians and trainers. They begin developing
supervisory and leadership skills through progressive responsibility, Airman
Leadership School (ALS), individual study, and mentoring. Senior Airmen strive
to establish themselves as effective trainers through the maximum use of
guidance and assistance from officer and enlisted leaders. They may serve as
first-line supervisors upon completion of ALS. The written abbreviation is “<span class="grame">SrA</span>” and the official term of address is “Senior Airman” or
“Airman.” </p>

<p class="msonormal17">9.5.2. <b class="calibre1">The
NCO Tier, Ranks and Roles. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal20">This tier consists of staff sergeant
and technical sergeant. NCOs continue occupational growth and become expert
technicians while developing as leaders, supervisors, managers, and mentors in
the profession of arms. Additionally, NCOs ensure they keep themselves and
subordinates trained, qualified, and ready to deploy and operate at home
station and in an expeditionary environment. In this tier, NCOs understand and
internalize institutional competencies in preparation for increased
responsibilities, while pursuing professional development through a variety of
means, including Enlisted PME. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">9.5.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Staff Sergeant.</b> Staff
sergeants are primarily highly skilled technicians with supervisory and training
responsibilities. Typically, at this rank they earn the 7-skill level. They
must continuously strive to further their development as technicians,
supervisors, and leaders through professional development opportunities,
including distance learning and/or in-residence Air Force Enlisted PME and
Senior Enlisted Joint PME. They are responsible for their subordinates’
development and the effective accomplishment of all assigned tasks. They must
ensure proper and effective use of all resources under their control to ensure
the mission is effectively and efficiently accomplished. They should consider
broadening opportunities through the Development Special Duty selection
process. The written abbreviation is “SSgt” and the official term of address is
“Staff Sergeant” or “Sergeant.” </p>

<p class="msonormal22">9.5.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Technical Sergeant.</b>
Technical sergeants are often their organizations’ technical experts. They
continuously strive to further their development as technicians, supervisors,
leaders and mentors through professional development opportunities, including
distance learning and/or in-residence Air Force Enlisted PME and Senior
Enlisted Joint PME. They should consider broadening opportunities through the
Development Special </p>

<p class="msonormal23">Duty selection process. The written
abbreviation is “TSgt” and the official term of address is “Technical Sergeant”
or “Sergeant.” </p>

<p class="msonormal17">9.5.3. <b class="calibre1">The
Senior NCO Tier, Ranks and Roles.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal24">This tier consists of master sergeant, senior
master sergeant, chief master sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant of the Air
Force. Senior NCOs serve as leaders in the profession of arms. They advise,
supervise and mentor others to further grow and develop junior enlisted Airmen
and NCOs under their charge. In this tier, senior NCOs continue professional
development through a variety of means, including Enlisted PME. They have a
great deal of leadership experience they use to leverage resources and
personnel against a variety of mission requirements. Senior NCOs participate in
decision-making processes on a variety of technical, operational, and
organizational issues.  </p>

<p class="msonormal25">9.5.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Master Sergeant.</b> Master
sergeants are technical experts, transitioning from first-line supervisors to
leaders of operational competence. This rank carries significantly increased
responsibilities and requires a broad perspective and greater leadership and
management skills. MSgts are expected to accomplish the mission through the
employment of teams by merging subordinates’ talents, skills, and resources
with other teams’ functions. MSgts must complete an Associate’s Degree from the
Community College of the Air Force in their current Air Force Specialty, if not
already earned, to become eligible for promotion to SMSgt. MSgts continue their

the Air Force.</b> The CMSAF is the senior enlisted leader of the Air Force and
takes precedence over all enlisted members. The CMSAF provides leadership to
the enlisted force and advises the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Secretary
of the Air Force, Chairman Joint chief of Staff, and the Secretary of Defense
on enlisted matters. The CMSAF communicates with the force, serves on boards
and committees for numerous organizations affecting Airmen, testifies before
congress, and is the Air Force career field manager for command chief master
sergeants and group superintendents. The CMSAF also consults with sister
service senior enlisted advisors on issues affecting all enlisted members;
engages with foreign military leadership regarding theater security cooperation
and partner nation development efforts; represents the Air Force to the
American public, professional organizations and the media; and manages the Air
Force Order of the Sword Program. The written abbreviation is “CMSAF” and the
official term of address is “Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force” or
“Chief.” The idea of creating a CMSAF position surfaced as early as 1964 when
the Air Force Association’s Airman Advisory Council presented the idea. At that
time, Air Force leadership rejected the proposal, fearing that such a position
would undermine the formal chain of command. Purposeful action did not come
until 1966 when Congressman Mendel Rivers introduced a bill that would mandate
each of the Services to appoint a senior NCO. Congressman Rivers became
convinced that the Air Force needed to follow the example of the Marine Corps
(which had created the position of Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps in 1957)
and the Army (which had created the position of Sergeant Major of the Army in
1965) and appoint a senior enlisted advisor to the Chief of Staff of the Air
Force. Although the Rivers bill never passed, the Air Force recognized the
tremendous support behind the proposal. On 24 October 1966, Chief of Staff of
the Air Force General John P. McConnell announced the newly created position of
CMSAF. In April 1967, Chief Paul W. Airey became the first to wear the unique
insignia with the wreath around the star. Over the next decade, support for the
office grew among senior leaders and within the enlisted force. Today, the
CMSAF wears the chevron depicted in Figure 9.3. To date,<span class="calibre8"> </span>17 individuals have previously served in this office. The present
CMSAF, <span class="grame">Kaleth</span> O. Wright, took office in February
2017.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1044" src="image004.png" class="calibre9"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal29">9.5.3.4.1.1. Paul Wesley Airey enlisted in
the Army Air Forces as a radio operator on 16 November 1942. By the height of
World War II, he was serving as an aerial gunner aboard B-24 bombers. While in
Europe, Airey and his crew were shot down over Vienna, Austria, captured, and
held prisoner by the Germans from July 1944 to May 1945. During the Korean
conflict, he was awarded the Legion of Merit for creating a means of
constructing equipment from salvaged parts, improving corrosion control of
sensitive radio and radar components. Following the war, Airey took the job of
first sergeant, a position he later said was one of the most important in the
Air Force. He subsequently served as first sergeant for six squadrons at four
bases over the next 12 years before being appointed to the highest NCO
position.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal30">9.5.3.4.1.2. Upon assuming his new
responsibilities, CMSAF Airey began tackling the problem of personnel
retention, an issue he identified as one of the greatest challenges he faced.
The first-term reenlistment rate was the lowest it had been in 12 years, but
Airey did not attribute the great decline to the unpopularity of the war in
Vietnam. He felt it was the consequence of “poor pay, numerous remote
assignments, good civilian employment opportunities, and an inequitable
promotion system.” He became an advisor to a committee to investigate and
recommend a more equitable system. His efforts helped produce the Weighted
Airman Promotion System which was adopted in 1970, eliminating local enlisted
promotion boards and equalizing promotion opportunities across career fields.
In retirement, Airey continued to be an enlisted advocate and spoke to Airmen
around the force. CMSAF Airey died in 2009. </p>

<b class="calibre1">CMSAF Donald L. Harlow: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal32"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1043" src="image005.png" class="calibre10"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal32">9.5.3.4.2.1. Born in Waterville, Maine,
Donald L. Harlow was the youngest of nine children. At age 22, after working a
variety of jobs to help support his mother and pay his tuition at a private
preparatory school, he was drafted into the Army Air Corps. Serving as an
armament and gunnery instructor, he taught cadets to fieldstrip and reassemble
their weapons and to synchronize firing guns through aircraft propellers. He
transferred to the personnel career field in 1945 and advanced to the grade of
Staff Sergeant before his February 1946 discharge from active duty. During the
Korean War, Harlow was recalled to active duty, holding various positions in
the personnel career field. At 16 years of service, he was promoted to Chief
Master Sergeant and was the personnel Sergeant Major for Headquarters United
States European Command and the Sergeant Major for the Executive Services
Division, Office of the Vice Chief of Staff. </p>

<p class="msonormal33">9.5.3.4.2.2. As the second to take the
reins, CMSAF Harlow continued to cut a path through the misunderstanding,
confusion, and mistrust that surrounded the CMSAF Ever vigilant, he campaigned
for and refined the newly established Weighted Airman Promotion System,
garnered continued flight <span class="grame">pay</span> for NCOs attending in-residence
PME and worked toward equal per diem for enlisted and officers. During Vietnam,
he directed his attention to where he felt it was most needed: young Airmen and
their issues, including racial tension, assignment concerns, and promotion
problems. Known for his no-nonsense approach and keen ability to listen, Harlow
advised the Chief of Staff of the Air Force on matters of true concern to the
enlisted force. While many of his recommendations did not result in policy
changes during his tenure, he planted the seeds for future change. After
retiring, Chief Harlow was a strong lobbyist for enlisted equality. CMSAF
Harlow died in 1997. </p>

<b class="calibre1">CMSAF Richard D. <span class="grame">Kisling</span>: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal34"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1042" src="image006.png" class="calibre11"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal35">9.5.3.4.3.1. Richard D. <span class="grame">Kisling</span> and his 10 siblings were raised on a farm in Iowa
during the Great Depression and the dust bowl years. The patriotism he
developed during his childhood was called on when he was drafted into the
Army’s combat infantry in 1945 during the effort to reconstitute the number of
soldiers driving through France. After training and deployment times, <span class="grame">Kisling</span> arrived in France a month before the war in Europe
ended. His unit assumed responsibility for negotiating the repatriation of
displaced Soviets. From there, <span class="grame">Kisling</span> separated from
the service for civilian life. After a few months spent missing the
camaraderie, he reenlisted for a brief stint in the Army. In 1947, he joined
the Army Air Forces, serving first as a clerk and later a personnel specialist.
Upon his promotion to Senior Master Sergeant in September 1958, he was among
the first group of Air Force enlisted members to wear the super grades of
Senior Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant. </p>

<p class="msonormal32">9.5.3.4.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Once assigned to
the Pentagon, CMSAF <span class="grame">Kisling</span> found the enlisted force
struggling through the development of a new Air Force. After talking with
several base officials, it was determined that the Air Force needed to develop
their NCOs like they did their officers. So <span class="grame">Kisling</span>
placed concerns for NCO professional development in the forefront of discussion
at the Pentagon. His persistence paid off when the first senior NCO academy was
approved by Congress in 1972. The Academy officially opened its doors in
January 1973; however, before the Academy opened its doors, the original plan
was to restrict its attendance to first sergeants. In the end, <span class="grame">Kisling</span> won the battle of making professional development
available to all senior NCOs. His concern for such enlisted issues as housing,
pay, promotions, education and training, and assignments earned him the respect
of his peers and the nickname, “the GI’s man in Washington.” CMSAF <span class="grame">Kisling</span> died in 1985. </p>

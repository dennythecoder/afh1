<p class="msonormal27">9.5.3.4.4
<b class="calibre1">CMSAF Thomas N. Barnes:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal30"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1041" src="image007.png" class="calibre9"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal30">9.5.3.4.4.1. Thomas N. Barnes grew up in the
war-related industries town of Chester, Pennsylvania. In 1949, he joined the
newly created United States Air Force as an aircraft maintainer specializing in
hydraulics. His first duty station found him at the leading edge of United
States Air Force integration efforts, as one of the first African-Americans to
join the unit. Barnes’ unit was flying Korean War support missions. Unbeknownst
to others in his squadron, a crew pal taught him the art of flight engineering
and let him fly resupply and medical evacuation missions. By his tour’s end,
Barnes had gained flight engineer certification, accumulated 750 flight hours
over enemy territory and earned the Air Medal. He was the first CMSAF with
direct Vietnam experience and the first African-American to serve in the
highest enlisted post of a military service. The Chief of Staff of the Air
Force consecutively extended him in 1975 and in 1976. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">9.5.3.4.4.2. CMSAF Barnes’ notable
contribution came in the area that inspired his greatest passion and ranked
among his largest challenges: working to ensure equality among the ranks and
races. He took great pride in the part he played in bringing about the Air
Force Social Actions Program in 1969. He labored to eliminate barriers for
women and convince the Air Force to use them in nontraditional roles. He
understood the value of continuing to educate Airmen and believed no one should
advance in rank without PME, working to establish the service’s firm commitment
to enlisted PME. Recognized throughout the force for his ability to communicate
with anyone, Barnes made listening to Airmen a priority. At the beginning of
his tenure, the question most asked of Barnes was, “What programs will you
implement for the blacks?” “The answer was ‘None’,” Barnes recalls. “I told
them I work for all blue suiters.” After his retirement, Barnes remained
actively engaged in Air Force issues. CMSAF Barnes died in 2003. </p>

<p class="msonormal36">9.5.3.4.5.<b class="calibre1"> CMSAF Robert D. <span class="grame">Gaylor</span>: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal30"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1040" src="image008.png" class="calibre14"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal30">9.5.3.4.5.1. Growing up in Indiana, Robert
D. <span class="grame">Gaylor</span> wanted to travel and learn a skill. He
enlisted in the Air Force in 1948, a transition time for America and the
military. As he arrived at basic training, President Truman issued Executive
Order 9981, <i class="calibre2">Establishing the President’s Committee on Equality of Treatment
and Opportunity <span class="grame">In</span> the Armed Forces</i>, calling for
equality of opportunity in the United States military. <span class="grame">Gaylor</span>
had had no experience with segregation or integration and he would witness the
long journey to full integration. His first duty was as a military policeman
and he excelled throughout his career, advancing to the rank of Master Sergeant
with only 7 years and 7 months of service. Serving as an instructor at basic
training and the NCO Academy convinced him that special duties help prepare
NCOs for greater leadership roles. In 1976, as a member of the Air Force<span class="calibre15"> </span>Manpower and Personnel Center, <span class="grame">Gaylor</span>
traveled extensively, giving 275 leadership talks annually. 9.5.3.4.5.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>CMSAF
<span class="grame">Gaylor’s</span> goal as the senior enlisted man was to feel
the <span class="grame">pulse <span class="calibre16"> </span>of</span>
the enlisted force and serve as a conduit of information. He addressed low
morale and the weak military public image head on. He educated the force on the
hazards of substance abuse and continued to raise confidence and shift
attitudes within the force. He is credited with securing a policy that allowed
Senior Airman to transport their families at government expense during permanent
change of station moves, a solid step toward improving quality of life. He
educated the force in order to eliminate the stereotypes and prejudices working
against equal opportunities for minorities and women. Finally, <span class="grame">Gaylor</span> promoted leadership. He traveled extensively,
talking to Airmen about taking pride in their military careers. He believes one
of the most important roles a former CMSAF can play is that of a link between
the United States Air Force of the past and today’s service. <span class="grame">Gaylor</span> continues to meet and serve Airmen, conducting more
than 40 Air Force base visits each year. </p>

<p class="msonormal27">9.5.3.4.6
<b class="calibre1">CMSAF James M. McCoy: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal30"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1039" src="image009.png" class="calibre14"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal30">9.5.3.4.6.1. James M. McCoy was raised in
the <span class="grame">midwest</span>, attending high school in Atchison,
Kansas, and college at St. Benedicts College in Atchison and St. Ambrose
College in Davenport, Iowa. He seriously considered a vocation in the
priesthood, but in 1951, during the height of the Korean War, he enlisted in
the United States Air Force as a radar operator. When the war ended, the Air Force
had too many operators and needed military training instructors. McCoy
volunteered and, with only 6 years of active duty experience, found himself in
charge of five groups of training instructors. He continued working within the
PME system, serving as NCO preparatory school commandant and as an NCO academy
instructor before returning to the personnel training field in 1973. A year
later he was selected as one of the United States Air Force’s 12 Outstanding
Airmen of the Year. He then became Strategic Air Command’s first senior
enlisted advisor. While there, McCoy was a member of the Air Force Management
Improvement Group, chaired by CMSAF Barnes, which formed to discuss management
issues and propose solutions. As a result, enlisted PME expanded into five phases.
</p>

<p class="msonormal30">9.5.3.4.6.2. With the public still
questioning the military involvement in Vietnam, the Air Force was experiencing
the lowest recruiting year ever; retention rates were also dropping when CMSAF McCoy
took office. His first challenge was to improve those numbers. In late 1979,
along with former CMSAF <span class="grame">Kisling</span>, he testified before
Congress that people were not reenlisting in the Air Force because they could
not make ends meet on enlisted pay. McCoy worked with recruiters to get the
right people in the Air Force and sought to improve the PME system from basic
training to the NCO and senior NCO level. During his tour as CMSAF, the Stripes
for Exceptional Performers Program was instituted to provide incentive and an
alternate promotion option for enlisted members. In addition to visiting
Airmen, he placed great value on being involved with the Pentagon staff. He
expanded the list of boards and conferences where he believed the CMSAF should
have a role. In retirement, McCoy remains at the forefront of Air Force issues,
having served in leadership positions with Air Force professional organizations
and speaking to Airmen throughout the force. </p>

<p class="msonormal37">9.5.3.4.7.
<b class="calibre1">CMSAF Arthur L. "Bud" Andrews: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal30"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1038" src="image010.png" class="calibre9"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal30">9.5.3.4.7.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>In January 1953, out of
a sense of patriotism and a desire to grow and develop, Arthur "Bud"
L. Andrews enlisted in the Air Force. During basic training, his training
instructor asked for volunteers to serve as APs. Thinking AP meant “air
police,” Andrews raised his hand. As it turned out, the training instructor
wanted area policemen. He spent the next 3 months picking up cigarette butts
outside the barracks. He eventually had an opportunity to enter the military
police force, where he served most of the next 14 years. In 1959, while working
as an investigator, Andrews was credited with solving a murder committed by an
Airman Second Class. By 1970, Andrews had served tours in Morocco, Thailand,
and Vietnam; became a first sergeant; and was promoted to the rank of Senior
Master Sergeant. During his career he spent a decade as a first sergeant. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">9.5.3.4.7.2. Upon assuming his new position,
CMSAF Andrews’ top priority could be described as getting back to basics. He
believed the most vexing problems (such as terms of pay, benefits, recruitment,
and retention) had been addressed and were evolving to meet Airmen’s needs.
While he continued to advise the Chief of Staff of the Air Force on
quality-of-life improvements, he began to focus on cultural change. He felt it
was time for Airmen to “think <i class="calibre2">we</i> instead of <i class="calibre2">me, me, me</i>.” He
wanted people to focus on “how we’re supposed to dress, act, and react toward
subordinates and superiors, and how we’re supposed to do our jobs.” He
challenged NCOs to “take care of their people and to accomplish the mission.”
He further suggested that NCOs look at themselves if they were dissatisfied
with their jobs. He dispelled the days of “leadership by stress” and applauded
PME for creating a smarter force. Andrews believed the CMSAF needed to know the
issues firsthand, which kept him traveling extensively around the Air Force.
CMSAF Andrews died in 1996. </p>

<p class="msonormal27">9.5.3.4.8
<b class="calibre1">CMSAF Sam E. Parish: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal30"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1037" src="image011.png" class="calibre17"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal30">9.5.3.4.8.1. Sam E. Parish was raised and
educated in north Florida. In 1955, at age 17, he joined the Air Force as a
ground weather equipment operator. His first assignment at Wiesbaden Air Base,
Germany, brought him into an experimental program to cross train as a weather
observer. That experiment led to a career. In 1960, he became the youngest
7-skill level in his career field and continued to excel. While the chief
observer for the 7th Weather Squadron in Heidelberg, Germany, he was quickly
promoted to Senior Master Sergeant, and at age 31, Parish made Chief Master
Sergeant. He was a member of the first senior NCO academy class, and was
selected as the Air Weather Service Senior Enlisted Advisor in 1973. He
returned to Germany in 1976 as the Consolidated Base Personnel Office Personnel
Sergeant Major, and in 1977 became the senior enlisted advisor for the United
States Air Forces in Europe, where he established the United States Air Forces
in Europe First Sergeant of the Year program. Parish later served as the 40th
Air Division and<sup class="calibre18"> </sup>Strategic Air Command senior enlisted advisor.<span class="calibre19"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal30">9.5.3.4.8.2. CMSAF Parish tackled a range of
enlisted personnel issues during his tenure. One such issue was the fixed-phase
point for promotion to Senior Airman, which would promote qualified Airmen to
Senior Airman at a set point in their initial enlistment, allowing them a
chance to be selected for Staff Sergeant during their first enlistment. He also
obtained Chief of Staff of the Air Force approval to allow flight line
personnel to wear a functional badge on their uniform, which led to United
States Air Force members in all specialties being able to wear functional
badges identifying their career fields. He also obtained Chief of Staff of the
Air Force approval to establish the John <span class="grame">Levitow</span>
Award for each level of PME and to implement the First Sergeant of the Year
Program Air Force-wide. He was known as a straight shooter who did not waste
time trying to figure out what people wanted to hear. Instead, he told them
what they needed to hear. To Parish, the CMSAF is the most important job in the
Air Force from an enlisted program perspective. In retirement, he continues to
support Airmen by attending service functions and visiting bases throughout the
Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal27">9.5.3.4.9.
<b class="calibre1">CMSAF James C. Binnicker: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal30"><span class="grame"><img id="_x0000_i1036" src="image012.png" class="calibre9"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal30">9.5.3.4.9.1. James C. Binnicker, raised in
Aiken, South Carolina, joined the Civil Air Patrol in high school with
aspirations of becoming a pilot. Cadet of the Year honors earned him a
scholarship to attend flight school and the right to represent his state as a
foreign exchange cadet in Great Britain. But, in 1957, doctors detected a high frequency
hearing loss, disqualifying him from the program. To stay close to his passion,
he joined the Air Force in the personal equipment, later called life support,
career field. By 1964, Binnicker cross trained into air operations, planning
flights for missions to Vietnam. While serving in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969, he
served as NCOIC of operations for the 22d Tactical Air Support Squadron, and
later as a Vietnamese-speaking linguist at the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces
Language School in Saigon. While in Vietnam, he set his sights on becoming the
CMSAF and, as such, being an advocate for enlisted Airmen. He also served as a
first sergeant and base Sergeant Major at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North
Carolina. In 1977, on the recommendation of CMSAF Thomas Barnes, he became the
sole enlisted member of the newly established President’s Commission on
Military Compensation. In addition, he spent over 7 years as the senior
enlisted advisor for the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing, 12th Air Force, Pacific Air
Forces, and Tactical Air Command. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">9.5.3.4.9.2. CMSAF Binnicker’s first order
of business was tackling the Airman performance report, a system of ratings
from 1 to 9. In an effort to more accurately differentiate between Airmen, the
enlisted performance report was created, along with a system to provide and
document performance feedback. Next, Binnicker set his sights on admitting
Master Sergeants to the senior NCO academy. He believed giving Airmen all the
responsibility they could handle would result in attracting and retaining
higher quality people in the Air Force. He also worked to give minorities and
women more responsibilities throughout the Air Force. The Chief of Staff,
United States Air Force recognized Binnicker as a staunch advocate and
spokesman for enlisted issues. His commitment to Airmen did not change
following his retirement in 1994. He stayed abreast of issues affecting the
enlisted force and visited PME classes to talk with students worldwide. In
addition, he served as president and chief executive officer for the Air Force
Enlisted Village until his death in March 2015. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">9.5.3.4.4 <b class="calibre1">CMSAF Thomas N. Barnes:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal44"><img src="image007.png" hspace="15" class="calibre9"/>9.5.3.4.4.1. Thomas N. Barnes grew up in the war-related
industries town of Chester, Pennsylvania. In 1949, he joined the newly created
United States Air Force as an aircraft maintainer specializing in hydraulics.
His first duty station found him at the leading edge of United States Air Force
integration efforts, as one of the first African-Americans to join the unit.
Barnes’ unit was flying Korean War support missions. Unbeknownst to others in
his squadron, a crew pal taught him the art of flight engineering and let him
fly resupply and medical evacuation missions. By his tour’s end, Barnes had
gained flight engineer certification, accumulated 750 flight hours over enemy
territory and earned the Air Medal. He was the first CMSAF with direct Vietnam
experience and the first African-American to serve in the highest enlisted post
of a military service. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force consecutively
extended him in 1975 and in 1976. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">9.5.3.4.4.2. CMSAF Barnes’ notable
contribution came in the area that inspired his greatest passion and ranked
among his largest challenges: working to ensure equality among the ranks and
races. He took great pride in the part he played in bringing about the Air
Force Social Actions Program in 1969. He labored to </p>

<p class="msonormal46">eliminate barriers for women and
convince the Air Force to use them in nontraditional roles. He understood the
value of continuing to educate Airmen and believed no one should advance in
rank without PME, working to establish the service’s firm commitment to
enlisted PME. Recognized throughout the force for his ability to communicate
with anyone, Barnes made listening to Airmen a priority. At the beginning of
his tenure, the question most asked of Barnes was, “What programs will you
implement for the blacks?” “The answer was ‘None’,” Barnes recalls. “I told
them I work for all blue suiters.” After his retirement, Barnes remained
actively engaged in Air Force issues. CMSAF Barnes died in 2003. 9.5.3.4.5.<b class="calibre1">
CMSAF Robert D. Gaylor: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal47"><img src="image008.png" hspace="15" class="calibre14"/>9.5.3.4.5.1. Growing up in Indiana, Robert D. Gaylor
wanted to travel and learn a skill. He enlisted in the Air Force in 1948, a
transition time for America and the military. As he arrived at basic training,
President Truman issued Executive Order 9981, <i class="calibre2">Establishing the President’s
Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity In the Armed Forces</i>,
calling for equality of opportunity in the United States military. Gaylor had
had no experience with segregation or integration and he would witness the long
journey to full integration. His first duty was as a military policeman and he
excelled throughout his career, advancing to the rank of Master Sergeant with
only 7 years and 7 months of service. Serving as an instructor at basic
training and the NCO Academy convinced him that special duties help prepare
NCOs for greater leadership roles. In 1976, as a member of the Air Force<span class="calibre15"> </span>Manpower and Personnel Center, Gaylor traveled
extensively, giving 275 leadership talks annually. 9.5.3.4.5.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>CMSAF
Gaylor’s goal as the senior enlisted man was to feel the pulse </p>

<p class="msonormal48"><span class="calibre16"> </span>of the enlisted force and
serve as a conduit of information. He addressed low morale and the weak
military public image head on. He educated the force on the hazards of
substance abuse and continued to raise confidence and shift attitudes within
the force. He is credited with securing a policy that allowed Senior Airman to
transport their families at government expense during permanent change of
station moves, a solid step toward improving quality of life. He educated the
force in order to eliminate the stereotypes and prejudices working against
equal opportunities for minorities and women. Finally, Gaylor promoted
leadership. He traveled extensively, talking to Airmen about taking pride in
their military careers. He believes one of the most important roles a former
CMSAF can play is that of a link between the United States Air Force of the
past and today’s service. Gaylor continues to meet and serve Airmen, conducting
more than 40 Air Force base visits each year. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">9.5.3.4.6 <b class="calibre1">CMSAF James M. McCoy: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal49"><img src="image009.png" hspace="15" class="calibre14"/>9.5.3.4.6.1. James M. McCoy was raised in the midwest,
attending high school in Atchison, Kansas, and college at St. Benedicts College
in Atchison and St. Ambrose College in Davenport, Iowa. He seriously considered
a vocation in the priesthood, but in 1951, during the height of the Korean War,
he enlisted in the United States Air Force as a radar operator. When the war
ended, the Air Force had too many operators and needed military training
instructors. McCoy volunteered and, with only 6 years of active duty
experience, found himself in charge of five groups of training instructors. He
continued working within the PME system, serving as NCO preparatory school
commandant and as an NCO academy instructor before returning to the personnel
training field in 1973. A year later he was selected as one of the </p>

<p class="msonormal28">United States Air Force’s 12 Outstanding Airmen of the
Year. He then became Strategic Air Command’s first senior enlisted advisor.
While there, McCoy was a member of the Air Force Management Improvement Group, chaired
by CMSAF Barnes, which formed to discuss management issues and propose
solutions. As a result, enlisted PME expanded into five phases. </p>

<p class="msonormal50">9.5.3.4.6.2. With the public still questioning the military
involvement in Vietnam, </p>

<p class="msonormal46">the Air Force was experiencing
the lowest recruiting year ever; retention rates were also dropping when CMSAF
McCoy took office. His first challenge was to improve those numbers. In late
1979, along with former CMSAF Kisling, he testified before Congress that people
were not reenlisting in the Air Force because they could not make ends meet on
enlisted pay. McCoy worked with recruiters to get the right people in the Air
Force and sought to improve the PME system from basic training to the NCO and
senior NCO level. During his tour as CMSAF, the Stripes for Exceptional
Performers Program was instituted to provide incentive and an alternate
promotion option for enlisted members. In addition to visiting Airmen, he
placed great value on being involved with the Pentagon staff. He expanded the
list of boards and conferences where he believed the CMSAF should have a role.
In retirement, McCoy remains at the forefront of Air Force issues, having
served in leadership positions with Air Force professional organizations and
speaking to Airmen throughout the force. </p>

<p class="msonormal51">9.5.3.4.7. <b class="calibre1">CMSAF Arthur L. "Bud" Andrews: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal52"><img src="image010.png" hspace="15" class="calibre9"/>9.5.3.4.7.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>In January 1953, out of a sense of
patriotism and a desire to grow and develop, Arthur "Bud" L. Andrews
enlisted in the Air Force. During basic training, his training instructor asked
for volunteers to serve as APs. Thinking AP meant “air police,” Andrews raised
his hand. As it turned out, the training instructor wanted area policemen. He
spent the next 3 months picking up cigarette butts outside the barracks. He
eventually had an opportunity to enter the military police force, where he
served most of the next 14 years. In 1959, while working as an investigator,
Andrews was credited with solving a murder committed by an Airman Second Class.
By 1970, Andrews had served tours in Morocco, Thailand, and Vietnam; became a
first sergeant; and was promoted to the rank of Senior Master Sergeant. During
his career he spent a decade as a first sergeant. </p>

<p class="msonormal53">9.5.3.4.7.2. Upon assuming his new position, CMSAF Andrews’
top priority could be described as getting back to basics. He believed the most
vexing problems (such as terms of pay, benefits, recruitment, and retention)
had been addressed and were evolving to meet Airmen’s needs. While he continued
to advise the Chief of Staff </p>

<p class="msonormal46">of the Air Force on
quality-of-life improvements, he began to focus on cultural change. He felt it
was time for Airmen to “think <i class="calibre2">we</i> instead of <i class="calibre2">me, me, me</i>.” He
wanted people to focus on “how we’re supposed to dress, act, and react toward
subordinates and superiors, and how we’re supposed to do our jobs.” He
challenged NCOs to “take care of their people and to accomplish the mission.”
He further suggested that NCOs look at themselves if they were dissatisfied
with their jobs. He dispelled the days of “leadership by stress” and applauded
PME for creating a smarter force. Andrews believed the CMSAF needed to know the
issues firsthand, which kept him traveling extensively around the Air Force.
CMSAF Andrews died in 1996. </p>

<p class="msonormal54">9.5.3.4.8 <b class="calibre1">CMSAF Sam E. Parish: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal55"><img src="image011.png" hspace="15" class="calibre17"/>9.5.3.4.8.1. Sam E. Parish was raised and educated in
north Florida. In 1955, at age 17, he joined the Air Force as a ground weather
equipment operator. His first assignment at Wiesbaden Air Base, Germany,
brought him into an experimental program to cross train as a weather observer. That
experiment led to a career. In 1960, he became the youngest 7-skill level in
his career field and continued to excel. While the chief observer for the 7th
Weather Squadron in Heidelberg, Germany, he was quickly promoted to Senior
Master Sergeant, and at age 31, Parish made Chief Master Sergeant. He was a
member of the first senior NCO academy class, and was selected as the Air
Weather Service Senior Enlisted Advisor in 1973. He returned to Germany in 1976
as the Consolidated Base Personnel Office Personnel Sergeant Major, and in 1977
became the senior enlisted advisor for the United States Air Forces in Europe,
where he established the United States Air Forces in Europe First Sergeant of
the Year program. Parish later served as the 40th Air Division and<sup class="calibre18"> </sup>Strategic
Air Command senior enlisted advisor.<span class="calibre19">
</span></p>

<p class="msonormal45">9.5.3.4.8.2. CMSAF Parish tackled a
range of enlisted personnel issues during his tenure. One such issue was the
fixed-phase point for promotion to Senior Airman, </p>

<p class="msonormal56">which would promote qualified Airmen to Senior Airman at a set
point in their initial enlistment, allowing them a chance to be selected for
Staff Sergeant during their first enlistment. He also obtained Chief of Staff
of the Air Force approval to allow flight line personnel to wear a functional
badge on their uniform, which led to United States Air Force members in all
specialties being able to wear functional badges identifying their career
fields. He also obtained Chief of Staff of the Air Force approval to establish
the John Levitow Award for each level of PME and to implement the First
Sergeant of the Year Program Air Force-wide. He was known as a straight shooter
who did not waste time trying to figure out what people wanted to hear.
Instead, he told them what they needed to hear. To Parish, the CMSAF is the
most important job in the Air Force from an enlisted program perspective. In
retirement, he continues to support Airmen by attending service functions and
visiting bases throughout the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">9.5.3.4.9. <b class="calibre1">CMSAF James C. Binnicker: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal57"><img src="image012.png" hspace="15" class="calibre9"/>9.5.3.4.9.1. James C. Binnicker, raised in Aiken, South
Carolina, joined the Civil Air Patrol in high school with aspirations of
becoming a pilot. Cadet of the Year honors earned him a scholarship to attend
flight school and the right to represent his state as a foreign exchange cadet
in Great Britain. But, in 1957, doctors detected a high frequency hearing loss,
disqualifying him from the program. To stay close to his passion, he joined the
Air Force in the personal equipment, later called life support, career field.
By 1964, Binnicker cross trained into air operations, planning flights for
missions to Vietnam. While serving in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969, he served as
NCOIC of operations for the 22d Tactical Air Support Squadron, and later as a
Vietnamese-speaking linguist at the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces Language
School in Saigon. While in Vietnam, he set his sights on becoming the CMSAF
and, as such, being an advocate for enlisted Airmen. He also served as a first
sergeant and base Sergeant Major at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North
Carolina. In 1977, on the recommendation of CMSAF Thomas Barnes, he became the
sole enlisted member of the newly established President’s Commission on
Military Compensation. In addition, he spent over 7 years as the senior
enlisted advisor for the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing, 12th Air Force, Pacific Air
Forces, and Tactical Air Command. </p>

<p class="msonormal46">9.5.3.4.9.2. CMSAF Binnicker’s
first order of business was tackling the Airman performance report, a system of
ratings from 1 to 9. In an effort to more accurately differentiate between
Airmen, the enlisted performance report was created, along with a system to
provide and document performance feedback. Next, Binnicker set his sights on
admitting Master Sergeants to the senior NCO academy. He believed giving Airmen
all the responsibility they could handle would result in attracting and
retaining higher quality people in the Air Force. He also worked to give
minorities and women more responsibilities throughout the Air Force. The Chief
of Staff, United States Air Force recognized Binnicker as a staunch advocate
and spokesman for enlisted issues. His commitment to Airmen did not change
following his retirement in 1994. He stayed abreast of issues affecting the
enlisted force and visited PME classes to talk with students worldwide. In
addition, he served as president and chief executive officer for the Air Force
Enlisted Village until his death in March 2015. </p>

JOINT FORCE </b></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 4A</i>—<i class="calibre2">Overview
</i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">4.1. Introduction: </b>4.1.1.
America’s Air Force faces significant challenges. We have been engaged in
combat while transforming into a smaller, leaner, and more capable force.
Fiscal constraints combined with operational challenges and a dynamic
international security environment translate into risks we continue to manage
and mitigate in order to provide capabilities America needs. The Air Force
continues to fight the war on terrorism and prepares to face new threats and
conflicts of the future. In order to remain dominant, we must maintain our
airpower advantages over potential adversaries. Modern warfare is changing.
This is not new for America’s Airmen, whose heritage spans and embraces change
and whose culture embodies courage and innovation. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.1.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Meeting the challenges in this rapidly changing world requires we
understand and apply Air Force doctrine. Airmen may not have understood or
consistently applied doctrine. The complexity of integrating fighting elements
according to joint, Air Force and multinational doctrine and the uncertainty
inherent in rapidly developing contingency operations demand that planning and
employment be understood and repeatable. We must learn and practice our own
doctrine. We know how to do it right; we have taken the time to research, write
it down, and publish it. We must understand what it means to be an Airman, and
we must be able to articulate what air power can bring to the joint fight.
Volume 1, <i class="calibre2">Air Force Basic Doctrine,</i> is the Air Force’s premier statement
of our beliefs, and the cornerstone upon which our service identity is based.
Air Force Doctrine is developed by the LeMay Center for Doctrine Development
and Education at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. Air Force doctrine is
web-based, and is available at <a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">https://doctrine.af.mil/</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre6">.</span></a>
</p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3">4.1.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Air Force forces are presented to a joint force commander as an
air expeditionary task force, or may be composed of the air component to the
joint task force or combatant commander (CCDR) as the C-Numbered Air Force or
CMajor Command. The AEF is the Air Force methodology to provide Air Force
forces and support on a rotational, predictable basis. Three principles are the
foundation upon which the AEF is structured and executed: transparency,
predictability, and equitability. Transparency is the sense that there is no
mystery to the process; when, why, and how should be visible and understandable
by every Airman. Every Air Force member is responsible for knowing and
understanding the AEF original structure, how we deploy today’s AEF, and our
goals for the future. By aligning forces in AEF bands and utilizing the teaming
concept our Air Force is able to determine who goes first, defines our battle
rhythm, and provides a logically organized structure during surge periods to
support CCDRs. The AEF is merely a vehicle for managing and scheduling Air
Force forces for expeditionary purposes; it is not a warfighting organization.
The Air Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) is normally the warfighting
organization attached to the JFC. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre3">4.1.4.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Joint warfare is team warfare. Over time, the American experience
in war increasingly demanded cooperation, coordination, and integration of all
U.S. military Services. Today, joint operations are routine and, thus, routinely
practiced. Effectively integrated joint forces are able to rapidly and
efficiently identify and engage adversary weak points and vulnerabilities,
without exposing their own weak points or seams, to ensure mission
accomplishment. Whether there are years to prepare and plan (as in the World
War II Normandy invasion), months (as in Operation DESERT STORM), or only a few
weeks (as in Operation ENDURING FREEDOM), American armed forces must always be
ready to operate in smoothly functioning, joint teams. </p>

Force Doctrine </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">4.2. Uses of Doctrine.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">One way to explore good doctrine is to use a “compare and
contrast” model to walk through some key issues. This technique also amplifies
the point that doctrine should be written broadly, allowing decision makers
latitude in interpretation and flexibility in application, yet be specific
enough to provide informed guidance. This technique also illustrates the use of
doctrine in explaining contentious issues and how doctrine can be used to think
more effectively about the best means to integrate various aspects of military
power and organization. In the following discussion, there may be overlap among
some of the principles expressed; this is desirable in that often there are
different aspects or nuances to a particular issue. In doctrine, language is
important. Finally, the following discussion presents an Air Force perspective;
not all Services may entirely agree with these points. <a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre6">(</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Reference: Volume 1 </span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">– </span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Basic
Doctrine</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre6">)</span></a> </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.2.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Doctrine is about <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">warfighting</i></b>, not <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">physics</i></b>.
This principle specifically addresses the perceived differences between
operations in air, space, and cyberspace. Air, space, and cyberspace are
separate domains requiring exploitation of different sets of physical laws to
operate in, but are linked by the effects they can produce together. To achieve
a common purpose, air, space, and cyberspace capabilities need to be
integrated. Therefore, Air Force doctrine focuses on the best means to obtain
warfighting effects regardless of the medium in which a platform operates. As
an example, Airmen should be concerned with the best means of employing
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, not whether a
particular intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platform is airborne
or in orbit. This is requisite to achieving true integration across any given
collection of forces. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.2.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Doctrine is about <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">effects</i></b>, not <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">platforms</i></b>.
This focuses on the desired outcome of a particular action, not on the system
or weapon itself that provides the effect. For example, doctrine states that
Airmen should seek to achieve air superiority, but doctrine does not focus on
which platforms should be used to achieve that effect. A parallel example of
this is seen in the recognition that bombers are not “strategic,” nor are
fighters “tactical.” Similarly, it does not matter if an F-16 or a B-52
accomplishes a given task, or whether a particular platform is manned or
unmanned, or whether a C-17 or a C-130 delivers a certain load; the outcome of
the mission, the effect achieved, is what’s important. Thus, Air Force doctrine
does not explicitly tie specific weapon systems to specific tasks or effects. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.2.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Doctrine is about <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">using mediums</i></b>, not <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">owning
mediums</i></b>. This illustrates the importance of properly using a medium to
obtain the best warfighting effects, not of carving up the battlespace based on
Service or functional parochialism. Focusing on using a medium is a vital first
step to integration of efforts. “Ownership” arguments eventually lead to
suboptimal (and usually at best tactical) application of efforts at the expense
of the larger, total effort. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.2.4.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Doctrine is about <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">organization</i></b>, not <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">organizations</i></b>.
Modern warfare demands that disparate parts of different Services, different
nations, and even differing functions within a single Service be brought
together intelligently to achieve unity of command and unity of effort.
However, merely placing different organizations together in an area of
operations is insufficient to meet these demands. A single, cohesive
organization is required with clearly defined lines of command and commanders
with requisite authorities at appropriate levels. Doctrine explains why certain
organizational structures are preferred over others and describes effective command
relationships and command authorities; this facilitates the rapid standup of
joint and Service organizations during rapidly evolving situations. Ultimately,
doctrine is not about whether one particular element of a joint force is more
decisive than another, nor about positing that element as the centerpiece of
joint operations; it’s the total, tailored joint force that’s decisive. Getting
to that effective joint force requires smart organization and a thorough
understanding of Service and joint doctrine. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.2.5.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Doctrine is about <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">synergy</i></b>, not <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">segregation</i></b>.
True integration of effort cannot be achieved by merely carving up the
operational environment. While segregation may have some benefit and may appear
the simplest way, from a command and control viewpoint, to manage elements of a
diverse joint force, it may actually suboptimize the overall effort. It
guarantees that the whole will never be greater than the sum of its parts. For
example, Airmen should have access to the entire theater of operations to
maximize their ability to achieve joint force commander objectives; they should
not be restricted from any area due to unnecessarily restrictive fire control
measures. Also, segregating the battlespace into smaller areas of operation may
create competition for scarce, high-demand, low-density capabilities and reduce
combat effectiveness. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.2.6.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Doctrine is about <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">integration</i></b>, not just <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">synchronization</i></b>.
Synchronization is defined as “the arrangement of military actions in time,
space, and purpose to produce maximum relative combat power at a decisive place
and time” (Joint Publication 1-02). Integration, by comparison, is defined as
“the arrangement of military forces and their actions to create a force that
operates by engaging as a whole” (Joint Publication 1-02). Synchronization is,
in essence, deconfliction in time and space between different units. A useful
means is to plan and execute operations and to prevent fratricide. However, it
doesn’t scale up to the operational level and hence is not the best means for
achieving the maximum potential of a joint force. Synchronization emphasizes
timing, while integration considers priority and effect to be both efficient
and effective with scarce resources. Synchronization is bottom-up; integration,
on the other hand, starts at the top with a single cohesive plan and works
downward. Synchronization is an additive “sum of the parts” model, while
integration may produce geometric results. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.2.7.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Doctrine is about <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">the right force</i></b>, not just <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">equal
shares of the force</i></b>. This addresses the proper mix of Service
components within a joint force. Some believe that a joint force requires equal
parts of all the Services. This is an incorrect view. As one senior Air Force
officer said, “joint warfighting is not like Little League baseball, where everybody
gets a chance to play.” Any given joint force should be tailored appropriately
for the task at hand. Some operations will be land-centric, others air-centric,
others maritime-, cyberspace-, or information-centric. The composition of the
joint force and the tasks assigned its various elements should reflect the
needs of the situation. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">4.3. Levels of Airpower Doctrine.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">As implemented in the Air Force, doctrine affects operations
at three levels: basic, operational, and tactical. These levels speak to the
intellectual content of the doctrinal concepts, not to the architectural
structure of doctrine publications. <a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre6">(</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Reference: Volume 1 </span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">– </span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Basic
Doctrine</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre6">)</span></a> </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.3.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Basic doctrine </b>states the most fundamental and enduring
beliefs that describe and guide the proper use, presentation, and organization
of forces in military action. Basic doctrine describes the “elemental
properties” of airpower and provides the Airman’s perspective. Because of its
fundamental and enduring character, basic doctrine provides broad and
continuing guidance on how Air Force forces are organized, employed, equipped,
and sustained. Because it expresses broad, enduring fundamentals, basic
doctrine changes relatively slowly compared to the other levels of doctrine. As
the foundation of all doctrine, basic doctrine also sets the tone and vision
for doctrine development for the future. Air Force Doctrine Volume 1 is the Air
Force’s basic doctrine publication. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.3.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Operational doctrine </b>contained in doctrine annexes
describe more detailed organization of forces and applies the principles of
basic doctrine to military actions. Operational doctrine guides the proper
organization and employment of air, space, and cyberspace forces in the context
of distinct objectives, force capabilities, broad functional areas, and
operational environments. Operational doctrine provides the focus for
developing the missions and tasks to be executed through tactical doctrine.
Doctrine at this level changes a bit more rapidly than basic doctrine, but
usually only after deliberate internal Service debate. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.3.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Tactical doctrine </b>describes the proper employment of
specific Air Force assets, individually or in concert with other assets, to
accomplish detailed objectives. Tactical doctrine considers particular
objectives (stopping the advance of an armored column) and conditions (threats,
weather, and terrain) and describes how Air Force assets are employed to
accomplish the tactical objective (B-1 bombers dropping anti-armor cluster
munitions). Air Force tactical doctrine is codified as tactics, techniques, and
procedures in Air Force (Air Force tactics, techniques, and procedures) -3
series manuals. Because tactical doctrine is closely associated with the
employment of technology and emerging tactics, change will likely occur more
rapidly than other levels of doctrine. Also, due to their sensitive nature,
many tactics, techniques, and procedures are classified. </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><b class="calibre1">4.4. Airpower:  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.4.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Airpower is defined as “the ability to project military power
or influence through the control and exploitation of air, space, and cyberspace
to achieve strategic, operational, or tactical objectives.” </b>The proper
application of airpower requires a comprehensive doctrine of employment and an
Airman’s perspective. As the nation’s most comprehensive provider of military
airpower, the Air Force conducts continuous and concurrent air, space, and
cyberspace operations. The air, space, and cyberspace capabilities of the other
Services serve primarily to support their organic maneuver paradigms; the Air
Force employs air, space, and cyberspace capabilities with a broader focus on
theater-wide and national-level objectives. Through airpower, the Air Force
provides the versatile, wide-ranging means towards achieving national
objectives with the ability to deter and respond immediately to crises anywhere
in the world. <a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre6">(</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Reference:
Volume 1 </span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">– </span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Basic Doctrine</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre6">)</span></a> </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.4.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Airpower exploits the third dimension of the operational
environment; the electromagnetic spectrum; and time to leverage speed, range,
flexibility, precision, tempo, and lethality to create effects from and within
the air, space, and cyberspace domains. </b>From this multi-dimensional
perspective, Airmen can apply military power against an enemy’s entire array of
diplomatic, informational, military, and economic instruments of power, at long
ranges and on short notice. Airpower can be applied across the strategic,
operational, and tactical levels of war simultaneously, significantly
increasing the options available to national leadership. Due to its range,
speed, and flexibility, airpower can compress time, controlling the tempo of
operations in our favor. Airpower should be employed with appropriate
consideration of land and maritime power, not just during operations against
enemy forces, but when used as part of a team that protects and aids friendly
forces as well. </p>

<p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre3">4.4.2.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Much of what airpower can accomplish from within these three
domains is done to critically affect events in the land and maritime
domains—this is the heart of joint domain integration, a fundamental aspect of
airpower’s contribution to United States (U.S.) national interests. Airmen
integrate capabilities across air, space, and cyberspace domains to achieve effects
across all domains in support of joint force commander objectives. For example,
a remotely piloted aircraft operating from a ground station in the continental
U.S. relies on space and cyberspace capabilities to support operations
overseas. While all Services rely more and more on such integration,
cross-domain integration is fundamental to how Airmen employ airpower to
complement the joint force. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre3">4.4.2.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Airmen exploit the third dimension, which consists of the entire
expanse above the earth’s surface. The third dimensions lower limit is the
earth’s surface (land or water), and the upper limit reaches toward infinity.
This third dimension consists of the air and space domains. From an operational
perspective, the air domain can be described as that region above the earth’s
surface in which aerodynamics generally govern the planning and conduct of
military operations, while the space domain can be described as that region
above the earth’s surface in which astrodynamics generally govern the planning
and conduct of military operations. Airmen also exploit operational
capabilities in cyberspace. Cyberspace is “a global domain within the
information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information
technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications
networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.” In
contrast to our surface-oriented sister Services, the Air Force uses air,
space, and cyberspace capabilities to create effects, including many on land
and in the maritime domains, that are ends unto themselves, not just in support
of predominantly land or maritime force activities. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.4.2.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>The evolution of contemporary airpower stems from the Airman’s
original vision of combat from a distance, bypassing the force-on-force clash
of surface combat. Originally manifest in long-range aircraft delivering
kinetic weapons, airpower has evolved over time to include many long-range
supporting capabilities, notably the conduct of networked information-related
operations. This evolution has accelerated as Airmen conduct a greater
percentage of operations not just over-the-horizon but globally, expanding
operations first through space and now also in cyberspace. Just as airpower
grew from its initial use as an adjunct to surface operations, space and
cyberspace have likewise grown from their original manifestations as supporting
capabilities into warfighting arenas in their own right. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">4.4.3.<b class="calibre1"> Air Force doctrine presents airpower as a unitary
construct. </b>The Air Force acknowledges the importance of the space and
cyberspace domains. However, Air Force doctrine should address what unifies
Airmen.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Thus, in the Air Force’s senior doctrine product, the use of
concepts and language that bind Airmen together instead of presenting the Air
Force as a collection of tribes broken out in technological stovepipes
according to the domains of air, space, and cyberspace is appropriate. Other
subordinate doctrine products delve into the differences and interdependencies
of the core functions and missions conducted within and across the air, space,
and cyberspace domains, and within the context of more specific types of
operations. Where appropriate, this product will also mention air, space, and
cyberspace forces or capabilities. </p>

<p class="msonormal13"><b class="calibre1">4.5. The Airman’s Perspective.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">The practical application of “airmindedness” results in the
Airman’s unique perspective, which can be summarized as follows. <a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre6">(</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Reference: Volume 1 </span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">– </span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Basic
Doctrine</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre6">)</span></a> </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.5.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Control of the vertical dimension is generally a necessary
precondition for control of the surface. </b>The first mission of an air force
is to defeat or neutralize the enemy air forces so friendly operations on land,
sea, in the air, and in space can proceed unhindered, while at the same time
one’s own military forces and critical vulnerabilities remain safe from air
attack. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.5.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Airpower is an inherently strategic force. </b>War and peace
are decided, organized, planned, supplied, and commanded at the strategic level
of war. Air Force forces can hold an enemy’s strategic centers of gravity and
critical vulnerabilities directly at risk immediately and continuously.
Airpower also has great strategic capability for nonlethal strategic influence,
as in humanitarian relief and building partnership activities. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.5.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Airpower can exploit the principles of mass and maneuver
simultaneously to a far greater extent than surface forces. </b>There are no
natural lateral boundaries to prevent air, space, and cyberspace capabilities
from quickly concentrating their power (physically or in terms of delivered
effects) at any point, even when starting from widely dispersed locations.
Airpower dominates the fourth dimension—time—and compresses the tempo of events
to produce physical and psychological shock. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.5.4.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Airpower can apply force against many facets of enemy power. </b>Air
Force provided capabilities can be brought to bear against any lawful target
within an enemy’s diplomatic, informational, military, economic, and social
structures simultaneously or separately. They can be employed in support of
national, combined/joint, or other component objectives. They can be integrated
with surface power or employed independently. </p>

<p class="msonormal14"><span class="calibre3">4.5.5.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Air Force forces are less culturally intrusive in many
scenarios. </b>Surface forces are composed of many people and vehicles which,
when arrayed for operations, cover a significant area. Thus, their presence may
be very visible to local populations and may create resentment during certain
types of stability operations and in counterinsurgency operations. Air Force
forces, operating from bases over the horizon or from just a few bases
in-country, have a smaller footprint for the effects they provide. Space and
cyberspace forces have a negligible in-theater footprint relative to the
capabilities they provide. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.5.6.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Airpower’s inherent speed, range, and flexibility combine to
make it one of the most versatile components of military power. </b>This
versatility component allows it to be rapidly employed against strategic,
operational, and tactical objectives simultaneously. The versatility of
airpower derives not only from the inherent characteristics of air forces
themselves, but also from the manner in which they are organized and
controlled. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.5.7.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Airpower results from the effective integration of
capabilities, people, weapons, bases, logistics, and all supporting
infrastructure. </b>No one aspect of air, space, and cyberspace capabilities
should be treated in isolation since each element is essential and interdependent.
Ultimately, the Air Force depends on the performance of the people who operate,
command, and sustain air, space, and cyberspace forces. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.5.8.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">The choice of appropriate capabilities is a key aspect in the
realization of airpower. </b>Weapons should be selected based on their ability
to create desired effects on an adversary’s capability and will. Achieving the
full potential of airpower requires timely, actionable intelligence and
sufficient command and control capabilities to permit commanders to exploit precision,
speed, range, flexibility, and versatility. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><span class="calibre3">4.5.9.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Supporting bases with their people, systems, and facilities
are essential to launch, recovery, and sustainment of Air Force forces. </b>One
of the most important aspects of the Air Force has proved to be its ability to
move anywhere in the world quickly and then rapidly begin operations. However,
the need for mobility should be balanced against the need to operate at the
deployment site. The availability and operability of suitable bases can be the
dominant factor in employment planning and execution. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.5.10.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Airpower’s unique characteristics necessitate that it be
centrally controlled by Airmen. </b>Airpower can quickly intervene anywhere,
regardless if used for strategic or tactical purposes. Thus, Airmen tend to
take a broader view of war, because the capabilities they command have effects
at broader levels of war. Airmen apply airpower through the tenet of
centralized control and decentralized execution.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">4.6. Principles of Joint Operations:  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.6.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Throughout the history of conflict, military leaders have noted
certain principles that tended to produce military victory. Known as the
principles of war, they are those aspects of warfare that are universally true
and relevant. As members of the joint team, Airmen should appreciate how these
principles apply to all forces, but should most fully understand them as they
pertain to Air Force forces. Airpower, no matter which Service operates the
systems and no matter which type of platform is used, provides unique
capabilities. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.6.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Valid principles, despite how deeply they are held, are no
substitute for sound, professional judgment; however, ignoring them completely
assumes unnecessary risk. The complexity of war in general, and the unique
character of each war in particular, preclude commanders from using these
principles as a checklist to guarantee victory. Rather, they serve as valuable
guides to evaluate potential courses of action. The principles are independent,
but tightly fused in application. No one principle should be considered without
due consideration of the others. These principles are not all inclusive; the
art of developing airpower strategies depends upon the Airman’s ability to view
these principles from a three-dimensional perspective and integrate their
application accordingly. The principles of war, combined with the additional
tenets of airpower discussed elsewhere, provide the basis for a sound and
enduring doctrine for the air, space, and cyberspace forces of America’s joint
force. <a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre6">(</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Reference: Volume 1 </span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">– </span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Basic

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.6.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>The principles of war are: </p>

<p class="msonormal11">4.6.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Unity of command ensures concentration of
effort for every objective under one responsible commander. </b>This principle
emphasizes that all efforts should be directed and coordinated toward a common
objective. Airpower’s operational-level perspective calls for unity of command
to gain the most effective and efficient application. Coordination may be
achieved by cooperation; however, coordination is best achieved by vesting a
single commander with the authority and the capability to direct all force
employment in pursuit of a common objective. In many operations, the
wide-ranging interagency and nongovernmental organizations involved may dilute
unity of command. Effective information-sharing arrangements may preserve unity
of effort to ensure common focus and mutually supporting actions. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">4.6.3.1.1. Unity of command is vital in employing airpower.
Airpower is the product of multiple capabilities, and centralized control is
essential to effectively fuse these capabilities and provide unity of command. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">4.6.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> The principle of objective is to direct
military operations toward a defined and attainable objective that contributes
to strategic, operational, and tactical aims. </b>In application, this
principle refers to unity of effort in purpose, space, and time. In a broad
sense, this principle holds that political and military goals should be
complementary and clearly articulated. A clear National Military Strategy
provides focus for defining campaign or theater objectives. At the operational
level, campaign or theater objectives determine military priorities. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">4.6.3.2.1. The objective is important due to the
flexibility and versatility of airpower. From the outset, airpower can pursue
tactical, operational, or strategic objectives, in any combination, or all
three simultaneously. By integrating the potential offered by air, space, and
cyberspace capabilities, Airmen can overcome the challenges imposed by distance
and time. From an Airman’s perspective, then, the principle of objective shapes
priorities to allow airpower to concentrate on theater or campaign priorities
and seeks to avoid the siphoning of force elements to fragmented objectives. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">4.6.3.3.<b class="calibre1"> The purpose of an offensive action is to seize,
retain, and exploit the initiative. </b>The offensive aim is to act rather than
react and to dictate the time, place, purpose, scope, intensity, and pace of
operations. The initiative should be seized as soon as possible. The principle
of the offensive holds that offensive action, or initiative, provides the means
for joint forces to dictate operations. Once seized, the initiative should be
retained and fully exploited. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.6.3.3.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>This principle is particularly significant to airpower and is
best used as an offensive weapon. While defense may be dictated by the combat
situation, success in war is generally attained only while on the offensive.
Even highly successful defensive air campaigns such as the World War II Battle
of Britain were based upon selective offensive engagements. </p>

<p class="msonormal16"><span class="calibre3">4.6.3.3.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>The speed and range of attacking airpower gives it a significant
offensive advantage over other forces. In an air attack, for example, the
defender often requires more forces to defend a given geospatial area than the
attacker requires to strike a set of specific targets. The integration of air,
space, and cyberspace capabilities enhances the advantages of speed, range and
persistence found in airpower. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.6.3.3.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Although all military forces have offensive capabilities,
airpower’s ability to mass and maneuver, and its ability to operate
independently or simultaneously at the tactical, operational, and/or strategic
levels of war, provides joint force commanders a resource with global reach to
directly and rapidly seize the initiative. Whether deploying forces and
supplies into a region, conducting combat operations, or maintaining
information assurance, airpower provides the joint force commander the means to
take the offensive. Through prompt and sustained offensive actions designed to
attain operational and strategic objectives, airpower causes the enemy to react
rather than act, denies them the offensive, and shapes the remainder of the
conflict. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">4.6.3.4.<b class="calibre1"> The purpose of mass is to concentrate the
effects of combat power at the most advantageous place and time to achieve
decisive results. </b>Concentration of military power is a fundamental
consideration in all military operations. At the operational level of war, this
principle suggests that superior, concentrated combat power is used to achieve
decisive results. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.6.3.4.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Airpower is singularly able to launch an attack from widely
dispersed locations and mass combat power at the objective, whether that
objective is a single physical location or a widely dispersed enemy system or
systems. From an Airman’s perspective, mass is not based solely on the quantity
of forces and materiel committed. Airpower achieves mass through effectiveness
of attack, not just overwhelming numbers. Contemporary airpower has altered the
concept of massed forces. The speed, range, and flexibility of
airpower—complemented by the accuracy and lethality of precision weapons and
advances in information technologies—allow it to achieve mass faster than other
forces. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.6.3.4.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Air Force cyberspace capabilities, often enabled by space systems,
allow dispersed forces to collaborate to rapidly find, fix, track, and target
fleeting targets and mass a response in new ways. Previously, operators and
planners worked in relative proximity within the same theater of operations;
today, those same planners and operators leverage distributed capabilities to
apply precise effects around the globe. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.6.3.4.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Airlift and air refueling provide a significant and critical
capability to mass lethal and nonlethal forces on a global scale. The
capability of airpower to act quickly and mass effects, along with its
capability to mass other lethal and nonlethal military power, combine the
principle of mass with the principle of maneuver. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">4.6.3.5.<b class="calibre1"> Maneuver places the enemy in a position of
disadvantage through the flexible application of combat power in a
multidimensional combat space. </b>Airpower’s ability to conduct maneuver is
not only a product of its speed and range, but also flows from its flexibility
and versatility during the planning and execution of operations. Maneuver, like
the principle of offensive, forces the enemy to react, allowing the
exploitation of successful friendly operations and reducing friendly
vulnerabilities. Airpower maneuver allows engagement anywhere, from any
direction, at any time, forcing the adversary to be on guard everywhere. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">4.6.3.5.1. The principle of maneuver is not limited to
simple weapons delivery. Maneuver may involve the strategic positioning of
capabilities that bring potential airpower to bear within striking distance of
potential or actual adversaries. Forward deployment of airpower assets is one
example of maneuver that, by its very presence, can reassure allies and deter
aggressors. Also, in airlift operations such as SUPPORT HOPE in Rwanda, PROVIDE
HOPE in the former Soviet Union, or PROVIDE PROMISE in Bosnia; focused
civilmilitary operations and exercises that support theater security
cooperation goals, such as PACIFIC ANGEL; or combat operations such as ALLIED
FORCE in Serbia, ENDURING FREEDOM in Afghanistan, or IRAQI FREEDOM in Iraq,
airpower has played a critical role in American national security by providing
unmatched maneuverability. Whether it involves airlift or attack aircraft, in
small or large numbers, the versatility and responsiveness of airpower allow
the simultaneous application of mass and maneuver. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">4.6.3.6.<b class="calibre1"> Economy of force is the judicious employment
and distribution of forces. </b>Its purpose is to allocate minimum essential
resources to secondary efforts. This principle calls for the rational use of
force by selecting the best mix of air, space, and cyberspace capabilities. To
ensure overwhelming combat power is available, maximum effort should be devoted
to primary objectives. At the operational level of war, commanders ensure that
any effort made towards secondary objectives does not degrade achievement of
the larger operational or strategic objectives. This principle requires Airmen
to maintain a broader operational view even as they seek to obtain clearly
articulated objectives and priorities. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">4.6.3.6.1. Economy of force may require a commander to
establish a balance in the application of airpower between attacking,
defending, delaying, or conducting other operations such as information
operations, depending on the importance of the area or the priority of the
objective or objectives. Also, priorities may shift rapidly; friendly troops in
contact might drive a change in priority from one type of mission (e.g.,
interdiction) to another (e.g., close air support). Although this principle
suggests the use of overwhelming force in one sense, it also recommends
guarding against the “overkill” inherent in the use of more force than
reasonably necessary. This is particularly relevant when excessive force can
diminish the legitimacy and support for an operation. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">4.6.3.7.<b class="calibre1"> The purpose of security is to never permit the
enemy to acquire unexpected advantage. </b>Friendly forces and their operations
should be protected from enemy action that could provide the enemy with
unexpected advantage. The lethal consequences of enemy attack make the security
of friendly forces a paramount concern. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.6.3.7.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Critical to security is the understanding that it embraces
physical security, operations security, and security of the information
environment. Information has always been part of air, land, and sea warfare;
now, with the proliferation of advanced communications and computer
technologies, it becomes even more central to the outcome of a conflict. </p>

<p class="msonormal17"><span class="calibre3">4.6.3.7.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Aircraft are most vulnerable on the ground. </b>Thus, force
protection is an integral part of airpower employment. Fixed bases are
especially vulnerable as they not only should withstand aerial, ground, and
cyberspace attacks, but should also sustain concentrated and prolonged air,
space, and cyberspace activities against the enemy. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.6.3.7.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>From an Airman’s perspective, <b class="calibre1">security also may be obtained by
staying beyond the enemy’s reach, physically and virtually. </b>Airpower is
uniquely suited to capitalize on this through its ability to operate over the
horizon. Not only can airpower reach and strike at extended range, but it also
can distribute data and analysis as well as command and control across a
worldwide span. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.6.3.7.4.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Security from physical and electronic enemy intrusion conceals
our capabilities and intentions, while allowing friendly forces the freedom to
gather information on the adversary—the type of information that creates the
opportunity to strike the enemy where least expected. By exploiting the
vertical mediums of air and space, Airmen provide security for our nation and
friendly forces by detecting enemy actions and determining intentions even in
denied areas. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.6.3.7.5.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Commanders have an obligation to protect their forces, but the
threat and the means for countering it are quite different in contingency
operations. The threat varies depending on local circumstances, but the
commander must be aware that it always exists. Although U.S. forces have a
right to self-defense, Airmen must bear in mind the concepts of necessity and
proportionality when exercising that right (as discussed in the standing rules
of engagement). <b class="calibre1">Necessity </b>exists when a hostile act occurs or when a
force demonstrates hostile intent; use of force is then authorized while the
force continues to commit hostile acts or exhibit hostile intent. <b class="calibre1">Proportionality
</b>means the use of force should be sufficient to respond decisively, and may
exceed the means and intensity of the hostile act/intent, but the nature,
duration and scope of force should not exceed what is required. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.6.3.7.6.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>The concepts of necessity and proportionality as applicable to
self-defense should not be confused with those of military necessity and
proportionality as applicable in the law of armed conflict, which together seek
to minimize collateral damage during offensive or defensive operations during
armed conflict. Indeed, the defense of friendly forces against enemy attack
during armed conflict would not (subject to prevailing rules of engagement)
involve the concept of self-defense at all. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">4.6.3.8.<b class="calibre1"> Surprise leverages the principle of security by
attacking the enemy at a time, place, or in a manner for which they are not
prepared. </b>The speed and range of air, space, and cyberspace capabilities,
coupled with their flexibility and versatility, allow air forces to achieve
surprise more readily than other forces. The final choice of timing and tactics
rests with the air component commander because terrain and distance are not
inhibiting factors. </p>

<p class="msonormal18"><span class="calibre3">4.6.3.8.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Surprise is one of airpower’s strongest advantages. Operation EL
DORADO CANYON (the U.S. raid on Libya) and the opening day of the air campaign
during Operation DESERT STORM highlight examples where airpower achieved
surprise. </p>

<p class="msonormal19"><span class="calibre3">4.6.3.8.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Airpower can enhance and empower other forces to achieve surprise
as well. The rapid global reach of airpower can enable surface forces to reach
foreign destinations quickly, thus seizing the initiative through surprise. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">4.6.3.9.<b class="calibre1"> Simplicity calls for avoiding unnecessary
complexity in organizing, preparing, planning, and conducting military
operations. </b>Simplicity ensures that guidance, plans, and orders are as
simple and direct as the objective allows. Simple guidance allows subordinate
commanders the freedom to operate creatively within their portion of the
operational environment, supporting the concept of decentralized execution.
Common equipment, a common understanding of Service and joint doctrine, and
familiarity with procedures through joint exercises and training, can help
overcome complexity. Straightforward plans, unambiguous organization, and
clearly-defined command relationships are central to reducing complexity as well.
</p>

<p class="msonormal20">4.6.4. <b class="calibre1">Additional Principles of Operations. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">In addition to the traditionally-held principles of war, an
additional set of principles has been developed as a result of experience in
contingency operations. These were first cast as “principles of military
operations other than war” and later as “the political dimension of
smaller-scale contingencies.” A distinguishing characteristic of such
operations has been the degree to which political objectives influence
operations and tactics. (Note that joint doctrine does not contain unity of
effort as an additional principle.) These additional principles are: </p>

<p class="msonormal11">4.6.4.1.<b class="calibre1"> Often the military is not the sole, or even the
lead, agency in contingency operations. </b>Some operations are, by their
nature, predominantly military. In most situations, however, the military will
likely be one agency of many. As is especially common in stability operations,
military forces often find themselves supporting the other instruments of
national power. While unity of command is critical within the military forces,
most of these operations demand unity of effort among a wide range of agencies
to ensure that they coordinate their resources and focus on the same goal. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">4.6.4.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> Unity of effort becomes critical during
interagency operations and can best be achieved through consensus building. </b>Whereas
the main effort in military planning is on developing courses of action, the
main effort in interagency planning should be to develop a shared, detailed
understanding of the situation. This allows the various agencies to better
understand how they can best apply their respective capabilities and measure
success. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">4.6.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> Restraint is the disciplined application of
military force appropriate to the situation. </b>Commanders should recognize
that in some types of operations, use of more force than the minimum that is
reasonably necessary (even though under or at the maximum permissible) may lead
to escalation to a higher intensity conflict; could adversely affect efforts to
gain or maintain legitimacy; and may impede the attainment of both short- and
long-term goals. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">4.6.4.2.1. Air component commanders should begin developing
a force structure by outlining the necessary capabilities needed for an
operation and then follow up by deploying the appropriate “tailored” air,
space, and cyberspace force mix. In order to maintain effective security while
also exercising restraint, commanders should develop very clear rules on the
use of force and rules of engagement. The rules of engagement for contingency
operations are often more restrictive, detailed, and sensitive to political
concerns than in sustained combat operations. Moreover, these rules may change
frequently during operations. For all operations, Airmen should understand that
restraint in the use of force is appropriate and more easily justified.
However, restraint does not preclude the ability to use armed force, both
lethal and nonlethal, when necessary in self-defense. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.6.4.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">The principle of perseverance encompasses the patient,
resolute, and persistent pursuit of national goals and objectives, for as long
as necessary to achieve them. </b>Some contingency operations involve a
one-time occurrence or a short-term operation to maintain stability until local
authorities can take over. Many missions, however, especially peace operations
and building partner capacity, require a long-term commitment. The U.S. should
be prepared to stay involved in a region for a protracted time in order to
achieve its strategic goals. Complex problems often cannot be solved quickly;
if a situation has been building for a long time, it may take the same amount
of time or longer to resolve it. With this in mind, objectives should be
established for the conditions under which forces may leave, rather than simply
by a timetable for departure. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.6.4.4.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">In order to reduce the threat to U.S. forces and to enable them
to work toward their objective, the U.S. should be viewed as a legitimate actor
in the mission, working towards multi-lateral interests including our own. </b>While
legitimacy is principally generated by U.S. political leadership, legitimacy in
the eyes of the host nation or target population could be affected more by the
actions of the military. One key means of promoting legitimacy for certain
types of contingency operations is through robust and effective military public
affairs operations. Commanders should work closely with the host-nation
government (if, in fact, there is one) at all levels to help preserve and
foster the sense of legitimacy of mission. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">4.7. Tenets of Airpower.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">The application of airpower is refined by several
fundamental guiding truths. These truths are known as tenets. They reflect not
only the unique historical and doctrinal evolution of airpower, but also the
current appreciation for the nature of airpower. The tenets of airpower
complement the principles of joint operations. While the principles of war
provide general guidance on the application of military forces, the tenets
provide more specific considerations for the employment of airpower. The tenets
of airpower are identified below. <a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre6">(</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Reference:
Volume 1 </span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">– </span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Basic Doctrine</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre6">)</span></a> </p>

<p class="msonormal4">4.7.1. <b class="calibre1">The tenet of centralized control and decentralized
execution is critical to effective employment of airpower.</b> Indeed, they are
the fundamental organizing principles for airpower, having been proven over
decades of experience as the most effective and efficient means of employing
it. This tenet enables the principle of mass while maintaining economy of
force. Because of airpower’s unique potential to directly affect the strategic
and operational levels of war, it should be controlled by a single Airman who
maintains the broad, strategic perspective necessary to balance and prioritize
the use of a powerful, highly desired yet limited force.<b class="calibre1"> </b>A single air
component commander, focused on the broader aspects of an operation, can best
balance or mediate urgent demands for tactical support against longer-term
strategic and operational requirements. The ability to concentrate the air
effort to fulfill the highest priorities for effects and to quickly shift the
effort can only be accomplished through centralized control. On the other hand,
the flexibility to take advantage of tactical opportunities and to effectively
respond to shifting local circumstances can only be achieved through
decentralized execution. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.7.1.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>This tenet is best appreciated as a general philosophy for the
command and control of airpower. The construct of centralized control is an
encapsulation of a hard-learned truth: that control of a valuable yet scarce
resource (airpower) should be commanded by a single Airman, not parceled out
and hardwired to subordinate surface echelons as it was prior to 1943. Tied to
this fundamental truth is the recognition that no single Airman is capable of
making all decisions, and should thus empower subordinates to respond in
accordance with senior leader intent. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.7.1.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Centralized control should be accomplished by an Airman at the
functional component commander level who maintains a broad focus on the joint
force commander’s objectives to direct, integrate, prioritize, plan,
coordinate, and assess the use of air, space, and cyberspace assets across the
range of military operations. Centralized control may be manifest at different
levels within a combatant command depending on how the air component(s) is
(are) organized and the nature of the supporting command and control
architecture (functional or geographic). Also, due to the dynamics of the
operational environment, control over some capabilities may, over time, shift
up or down the command chain according to changes in priorities. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.7.1.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Centralized control empowers the air component commander to
respond to changes in the operational environment and take advantage of
fleeting opportunities, and embodies the tenet of flexibility and versatility.<b class="calibre1">
</b>Some would rather this be just “centralized planning and direction.” From
an Airman’s perspective, “planning and directing” do not convey all aspects of
control implied in “centralized control,” which maximizes the flexibility and
effectiveness of airpower. Centralized control is thus pivotal to the
determination of continuing advantage. However, it should not become a recipe
for micromanagement, stifling the initiative subordinates need to deal with
combat’s inevitable uncertainties.  </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.7.1.4.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Decentralized execution is defined as the “delegation of
authority to designated lower-level commanders” and other tactical-level
decision makers to achieve effective span of control and to foster disciplined
initiative and tactical flexibility. It allows subordinates, all the way down
to the tactical level, to exploit situational responsiveness and fleeting
opportunities in rapidly changing, fluid situations. The benefits inherent in
decentralized execution, however, are maximized only when a commander clearly
communicates intent and subordinate commanders frame their actions accordingly.
</p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.7.1.5.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Centralized control and decentralized execution of airpower
provide broad global or theater-wide focus while allowing operational
flexibility to meet military objectives. They assure concentration of effort
while maintaining economy of force. They exploit airpower’s versatility and
flexibility to ensure that it remains responsive, survivable, and sustainable. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.7.1.6.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Execution should be decentralized within a C2 architecture that
exploits the ability of front-line decision makers (such as strike package
leaders, air battle managers, forward air controllers) to make on-scene
decisions during complex, rapidly unfolding operations. Modern communications
technology may tempt commanders to take direct control of distant events and
override the decisions of forward leaders, even when such control is not
operationally warranted. This should be resisted at all costs in all functional
components— not just air. Despite impressive gains in data exploitation and
automated decision aids, a single person cannot, with confidence, achieve and
maintain detailed situational awareness over individual missions when fighting
a conflict involving many simultaneous engagements taking place throughout a
large area, or over individual missions conducted in locally fluid and complex
environments. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.7.1.7.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>There may be some situations where there may be valid reasons for
control of specific operations at higher levels, most notably when the JFC (or
perhaps even higher authorities) may wish to control strategic effects, even at
the sacrifice of tactical efficiency. However, such instances should be rare,
as in the short notice prosecution of high-value, time-sensitive targets, or
when the operational climate demands tighter control over selected missions due
to political sensitivities, such as the potential for collateral damage or
mistargeting, or in the case of nuclear employment. In all cases, senior
commanders balance overall campaign execution against the pressing need for
tactical effectiveness. As long as a subordinate’s decision supports the superior
commander’s intent and meets campaign objectives, subordinates should be
allowed to take the initiative during execution. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">4.7.2. Although often used interchangeably, flexibility and
versatility are different. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.7.2.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Flexibility allows airpower to exploit mass and maneuver
simultaneously. </b>Flexibility allows airpower to shift from one campaign
objective to another, quickly and decisively; to “go downtown” on one sortie,
then hit fielded enemy forces the next; to re-role assets quickly from a
preplanned mission to support an unanticipated need for close air support of
friendly troops in contact with enemy forces. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.7.2.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Versatility is the ability to employ airpower effectively at
the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war and provide a wide
variety of tasks in concert with other joint force elements. </b>Airpower has
the potential to achieve this unmatched synergy through asymmetric and parallel
operations. Space and cyberspace capabilities are especially able to
simultaneously support multiple taskings around the globe and support tasks at
all levels of warfare. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.7.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Synergistic Effects. The proper application of a coordinated
force across multiple domains can produce effects that exceed the contributions
of forces employed individually. </b>The destruction of a large number of
targets through attrition warfare is rarely the key objective in modern war.
Instead, the objective is the precise, coordinated application of the various
elements of airpower and surface power to bring disproportionate pressure on
enemy leaders to comply with our national will (affecting their intent) or to
cause functional defeat of the enemy forces (affecting their capability).
Airpower’s ability to observe adversaries allows joint force commanders to
counter enemy movements with unprecedented speed and agility. Airpower is
unique in its ability to dictate the tempo and direction of an entire warfighting
effort regardless of the scale of the operation. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.7.4.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Persistence. Air, space, and cyberspace operations may be
conducted continuously against a broad spectrum of targets.</b> Airpower’s
exceptional speed and range allow its forces to visit and revisit wide ranges
of targets nearly at will.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Airpower does not have to occupy terrain or
remain constantly in proximity to areas of operation to bring force upon
targets. Space forces in particular hold the ultimate high ground, and as space
systems continue to advance and proliferate, they offer the potential for
persistent overhead access; unmanned aircraft systems offer similar
possibilities from the atmosphere. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.7.4.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Examples of persistent operations might be maintaining a
continuous flow of materiel to peacetime distressed areas; Air Force
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities monitoring
adversaries to ensure they cannot conduct actions counter to those agreed upon;
assuring that targets are kept continually out of commission; or ensuring that
resources and facilities are denied an enemy or provided to an ally during a
specified time. The end result would be to deny the opponent an opportunity to seize
the initiative and to directly accomplish assigned tasks. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.7.4.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Factors such as enemy resilience, effective defenses, or
environmental concerns may prevent commanders from quickly attaining their
objectives. However, for many situations, airpower provides the most efficient
and effective means to attain national objectives. Commanders must persist in
the conduct of operations and resist pressures to divert resources to other
efforts unless such diversions are vital to attaining theater goals or to
survival of an element of the joint force. Given sufficient time, even the most
devastating strategic effects can be circumvented by resourceful enemies; the
goal is to keep pressure on and not allow the enemy that time. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.7.5.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Concentration. One of the most constant and important trends
throughout military history has been the effort to concentrate overwhelming
power at the decisive time and place.</b> The principles of mass and economy of
force deal directly with concentrating overwhelming power at the right time and
the right place (or places). The versatility of airpower with its lethality,
speed, and persistence makes it an attractive option for many tasks. With
capabilities as flexible and versatile as airpower, the demand for them often
exceeds the available forces and may result in the fragmentation of the
integrated airpower effort in attempts to fulfill the many demands of the
operation. Depending on the operational situation, such a course of action may
court the triple risk of failing to achieve operational-level objectives,
delaying or diminishing the attainment of decisive effects, and increasing the
attrition rate of air forces—and consequently risking defeat. Airmen should
guard against the inadvertent dilution of airpower effects resulting from high
demand. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.7.6.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Priority. Commanders should establish clear priorities for the
use of airpower. </b>Due to its inherent flexibility and versatility, the
demands for airpower may likely exceed available resources. If commanders fail
to establish priorities, they can become ineffective.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Commanders of all
components need to effectively prioritize their requirements for coordinated
airpower effects to the joint force commander, and only then can effective
priorities for the use of airpower flow from an informed dialogue between the joint
force commander and the air component commander. The air component commander
should assess the possible uses of component forces and their strengths and
capabilities to support the overall joint campaign. Limited resources require
that airpower be applied where it can make the greatest contribution to the
most critical current joint force commander requirements. The application of
airpower should be balanced among its ability to conduct operations at all
levels of war, often simultaneously. The principles of mass, offensive, and
economy of force, the tenet of concentration, and the Airman’s strategic
perspective all apply to prioritizing airpower. </p>

<p class="msonormal21"><span class="calibre3">4.7.7.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Balance is an essential guideline for air commanders.</b> <b class="calibre1">Much
of the skill of an air component commander is reflected in the dynamic and
correct balancing of the principles of joint operations and the tenets of
airpower to bring Air Force capabilities together to produce synergistic
effects. </b>An air component commander should balance combat opportunity,
necessity, effectiveness, efficiency, and the impact on accomplishing assigned
objectives against the associated risk to friendly forces. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">4.7.7.1. An Airman is uniquely—and best—suited to determine
the proper theater-wide balance between offensive and defensive air operations,
and among strategic, operational, and tactical applications. Air, space, and
cyberspace assets are normally available only in finite numbers; thus, balance
is a crucial determinant for an air component commander. </p>

<p class="msonormal23"><span class="calibre3">4.8.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">AEF Concept.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal11">The AEF concept provides forces and support on a rotational
and relatively more predictable basis. The AEF ‘force generation’ construct
establishes a predictable, standardized battle rhythm to ensure operational
forces are organized, trained, equipped, and ready to respond to CCDRs’
requests for forces. Using a rotational capacity construct, deployed units
undergo a period of dwell (i.e., time spent at home station) before entering
another deployment/mobilization vulnerability period. </p>

<p class="msonormal23"><span class="calibre3">4.8.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Expeditionary Capabilities. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">The Air Force relies on the AEF as a force management tool
to sustain capabilities while rapidly responding to emerging crises. The Air
Force supports global combatant commander requirements through a combination of
assigned, attached (rotational), and mobility forces that may be forward
deployed, transient, or operating from home station. There are four major
elements of the AEF structure: readily available force, enabler force, inplace
support, and institutional force. The first three elements are components that
primarily constitute the Air Force‘s warfighting capability and are therefore
postured in unit type codes. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.8.2.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Readily Available Force.</b> The readily available force is
the primary pool from which the Air Force fulfills Global Force Management
Allocation Plan requirements. To meet these requirements, the Air Force aligns
its warfighting capabilities (i.e. forces from combat, combat support, and
combat service support organizations) based on requirements relative to
assigned rotational capabilities for each vulnerability period.  </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.8.2.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">In-place Support.</b> <b class="calibre1">In-place Support.</b> There are two
types of in-place support; forces that almost exclusively employ in direct
support of a combatant commander mission, and those that represent the minimum
number of requirements to support critical home station operations. In-place
support forces are also included in the AEF Concepts. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.8.2.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Demand Force Team.</b> Demand Force Teams include user assets
with a unique set of mission capabilities, such as global mobility forces,
Special Operation Forces, personnel recovery forces, space forces, and other
uniquely categorized forces that provide support to authorized organizations within
and outside the Department of Defense. Most high demand/low supply assets, like
these are postured as Demand Force Teams and will rotate as operational
requirements dictate. Due to their unique nature, they cannot be easily aligned
in AEF battle rhythm; however, every effort must be made to develop a
sustainable plan by the Headquarters Air Force/major command functional area
managers as a part of the enabler nomination request package.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.8.2.4.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Institutional Force.</b> The institutional force consists of
those forces assigned to organizations responsible for Secretary of the Air
Force directed Title 10 functions at the Air Force level (such as organize,
train, equip, recruit, supply, etc.). Examples of these forces include:
Military Training Instructors, technical school instructors, and personnel
assigned to major commands and Headquarters staff. These organizations will not
posture unit type codes in the unit type code availability, unless a waiver is
granted by Headquarters Air Force. Although these organizations do not
represent a war-fighting capability, the individuals assigned to these
organizations are deployable. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.8.2.5.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">AEF Battle Rhythm.</b> The AEF operates on a 24-month life
cycle. This cycle includes periods of normal training, preparation, and
deployment vulnerability. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.8.2.5.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>For most forces, the majority of the AEF battle rhythm is spent
in normal training during which forces concentrate on unit missions and basic
proficiency events in accordance with applicable Air Force directives and Air
Force Specialty Code requirements. This may include Joint, Air Force, or major
command exercise participation such as Red Flag and Silver Flag. Most
contingency and deployment training should take place during this period. This
training and exercise period is also used to fill the unit's assigned/committed
mission requirements, filling contingency requirements for 30 days or less and
crisis response needs including humanitarian response operations and
operational plans. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.8.2.5.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Post-deployment reconstitution is included in this period. During
the month immediately after deployment, the unit is focused on recovery.
Permanent change of station or permanent change of assignment moves into and
out of the unit will be de-conflicted to the maximum extent possible to occur
during the                 3-month period immediately after the vulnerability
period. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><span class="calibre3">4.8.2.5.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>For forces aligned in the Enabler force, unit commanders should
develop a deployment schedule that provides a measure of predictability to
associated Airmen. However, operational requirements may force deviations from
the applicable battle rhythm. Major command vice commanders will ensure
appropriate mechanisms are in place to ensure Airmen postured as Enablers are
provided a measure of predictability/stability </p>

<p class="msonormal23"><span class="calibre3">4.8.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">Global Force Management. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">Global force management is the process the Secretary of
Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff use to assign forces to
combatant commander for mission accomplishment and allocate additional forces
to combatant commanders in the event of contingency operations and apportion
forces for combatant commander planning in the event contingency operations
escalate. Global force management also provides senior decision makers a
process to quickly and accurately assess the impact and risk of proposed
changes in force assignment, apportionment, and allocation.  </p>

<p class="msonormal23"><span class="calibre3">4.8.4.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">AEF Schedule.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal11">The AEF schedule operates on two 12-month life cycles that
align with the global force management cycle and coincide with fiscal years.
Prior to the beginning of every AEF cycle, Air Force specialty functional area
managers will revalidate the deployment to dwell period alignment of their
respective capability areas and realign forces if necessary. The Air Force goal
is that functional areas align to the least strenuous deployment to dwell baseline
to minimize risk to the force. Every 12 months a new 24-month AEF schedule will
be established </p>

<p class="msonormal23"><span class="calibre3">4.8.5.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span><b class="calibre1">AEF Teaming Construct.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal11">The Air Force has transitioned to the AEF Teaming concept.
This construct provides a better teaming concept through larger groupings of
unit type codes from fewer units/bases in order to allow Airmen to deploy with
their supervisors and members of their unit/base. This allows for shared common
experiences throughout the deployment process. However, it should be noted,
there will be no change to how the Air Force presents forces (air expeditionary
task force (rotational), Component-major command-Numbered Air Force
(in-place)). </p>

<p class="msonormal24"> </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">4.9. Air Expeditionary Force Schedule and Posturing:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal20">4.9.1.<b class="calibre1"> Posturing.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal25">The basic building block used in force
planning and the deployment of forces is the unit type code. A unit type code
is a Joint Chiefs of Staff developed and assigned code, five-character
alphanumeric designator uniquely identifying each type unit in the Armed
Forces, and its force capability with personnel and/or equipment requirements.
The assignment of a unit type code categorizes each type organization into a
class or kind of unit having common distinguishing characteristics. All Air
Force personnel contribute to the AEF and are inherently deployable or
employable in-place. Those organizations identified as a Combat, Combat
Support, or Combat Service Support or “war-fighting” organizations will posture
unit type codes. Institutional organizations identified as “other” will not
posture unit type codes. Posturing unit type codes is based on an
organization’s funded military authorizations as shown in unit manpower
document. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.9.1.1.<span class="calibre4">  </span></span>AEF
forces can be postured as forces <i class="calibre2">ready to deploy</i> to support combatant
commander worldwide requirements, home station requirements, or reach back
support to combatant commanders. This provides balanced war-fighting
capabilities across the AEF Construct to support combatant commander
requirements. With unit chain-of-command involvement and major command
leadership and/or AEF cell oversight, major command functional area managers
must determine which unit type codes to posture based on operational need,
organizational specifics, and posturing codes within their functional area. Not
all unit type codes will be postured, units may be tasked to support a unit
type codes they have not postured as long as the unit can meet the unit type
code’s mission capability statement. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.9.1.2.<span class="calibre4">  </span></span>The
various posturing codes (P-codes) indicate the number of unit type codes that
are required for assigned/committed missions, critical home station

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.9.2.1.<span class="calibre4">  </span></span>All
Airmen will be given an AEF indicator within 15-days of Date Arrive Station.
For individuals assigned to readily available forces, their AEF indicator will
correspond to the same AEF period as the unit’s unit type codes. For
individuals assigned to the Institutional Force, the AEF indicator will
correspond to an AEF vulnerability period determined by the Airman’s commander
or equivalent. Except in cases of reaching forward, individuals will deploy
during their associated AEF vulnerability period. Changing an individual’s AEF
indicator will be done only under extenuating circumstances, along with
permanent change of station or permanent change of assignment. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.9.2.2.<span class="calibre4">  </span></span>AEF
indicator Association Review. Prior to the start of each AEF Schedule, unit
commanders will review AEF indicator codes of assigned Airmen to ensure they

ensure equal distribution across the five vulnerability periods to the maximum
extent possible while meeting the needs of the organization. </p>

<p class="msonormal26">4.10.1. <b class="calibre1">Adaptive Planning and Execution
System (APEX).</b> Joint operation planning occurs within a system of joint
policies, procedures, and reporting structures known as APEX. APEX is supported
by communications and information technology that is used by the joint planning
and execution community to monitor, design, plan, execute, and assess
mobilization, deployment, employment, sustainment, redeployment, and
demobilization activities associated with joint operations. APEX formally
integrates the planning activities of the joint planning and execution
community and facilitates the seamless transition from planning to execution
during times of crisis. APEX is the physical, virtual, and policy structure
through which national strategic guidance is translated all the way down to
levels used by the Air Force to plan and execute deployment activities.
National strategic guidance proceeds through the following levels down to Air
Force-specific guidance on deployment and support for the AEF. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.10.1.1.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">National-Level

National Defense Strategy describes how the Department of Defense will support
the objectives lined out in the National Security Strategy, as well as
providing a framework for other Department of Defense guidance, specifically on
deliberate planning, force development, and intelligence. The National Military
Strategy provides the Chairman Joint Chief of Staff advice regarding the
security environment; it also defines national-level military objectives (i.e.,
ends), how to accomplish these objectives (ways), and addresses the military
capabilities required to execute the strategy (means). The Quadrennial Defense

operations, which are generally specific branches or sequels of combatant
commanders’ campaign plans, and which may be developed into detailed
“on-the-shelf” concept plans (with or without an Air Force time-phased force
and deployment data) or operation plans. These concept plans and operation
plans then often form the basis of crisis action planning for related
contingencies. Such plans will contain tasking for the Air Force Service
component as well as the joint or combined functional air component. Crisis
action planning will further develop requirements into specific operation
orders (such as warning, planning, alert, and execute orders) applicable to
particular units. It is important to realize, however, that commanders and
planners can “reach down” from any of the levels explained above and require
base- or unit-level deployment planning (and sometimes execution)—from theater

critical information to include the time phasing of forces by C-Dates to

unit type codes, this information includes personnel and equipment details. A
time-phased force and deployment data is a deployment planning and execution
tool containing live data that changes frequently. Time-phased force and
deployment data provide a prioritized list of what unit type codes deploy in

Joint Force </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">4.11. Introduction.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal26">This section assists Airmen to successfully
operate as members of a joint team. Specifically, this section discusses the
foundations of joint doctrine, characterizes doctrine governing unified
direction of armed forces, outlines the functions of the Department of Defense
and its major components, describes the fundamental principles for joint
command and control, details doctrine for joint commands, describes joint
planning, provides guidance for multinational operations.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal33"><b class="calibre1">4.12. Foundations of Joint
Doctrine.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal4">Joint doctrine promotes a common perspective from which to
plan, train, and conduct military operations. The foundations of joint doctrine
represents what is taught, believed, and advocated as what is right (that is,
what works best). U.S. military service is based on values that U.S. military
experience has proven to be vital for operational success. </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">4.13. Fundamental Principles for Joint Command and
Control:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.13.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Unity of command means all forces operate under a single
commander with the requisite authority to direct all forces employed in pursuit
of a common purpose. Unity of effort, however, requires coordination and
cooperation among all forces toward a commonly recognized objective, although
they are not necessarily part of the same command structure. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.13.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>The President and the Secretary of Defense exercise authority,
direction and control of the Armed Forces through two distinct branches of the
chain of command and control. The operational branch, used for executing
missions, runs from the President, through the Secretary of Defense to the
combatant commander. The operational branch includes the following types of
command authorities: </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.13.2.1.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>Combatant command authority
is the authority of a combatant commander to perform those functions of command
over assigned forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces,
assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction
over all aspects of military operations, joint training (or in the case of U.S.
special operations command, training of assigned forces), and logistics
necessary to accomplish the missions assigned to the command. It cannot be
delegated or transferred. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.13.2.2.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>Operational control is the
command authority that may be exercised by commanders at any echelon at or
below the level of combatant command and may be delegated within the command.
Operational control is inherent in combatant command and is the authority to
perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing
and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and
giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational
control includes authoritative direction over all aspects of military
operations and joint training necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the
command; it does not include authoritative direction for logistics or matters
of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.13.2.3.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>Tactical control is the
command authority over assigned or attached forces or commands, or military
capability or forces made available for tasking that is limited to the detailed
direction and control of movements or maneuvers within the operational area
necessary to accomplish assigned missions or tasks. Tactical control is
inherent in operational control and may be delegated to and exercised by
commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.13.2.4.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>A support relationship is
established by a superior commander between subordinate commanders when one
organization should aid, protect, complement, or sustain another force. Support
may be exercised by commanders at any echelon at or below the combatant command
level. This includes the Secretary of Defense designating a support
relationship between combatant commanders as well as within a combatant
command. The designation of supporting relationships is important as it conveys
priorities to commanders and staffs that are planning or executing joint
operations. The support command relationship is, by design, a somewhat vague
but very flexible arrangement. The establishing authority (the common superior
commander) is responsible for ensuring that both the supported commander and
supporting commanders understand the degree of authority that the supported
commander is granted. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">4.13.3<b class="calibre1">.</b> The administrative branch of the chain of
command, from the President through the Secretary of Defense to the Secretaries
of the military departments to the service chiefs, provides the authority for
the Secretary of the military department to accomplish those functions and
responsibilities of administration and support described in 10 United States
Code. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.13.3.1.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>Administrative control is
direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or other organizations in
respect to administration and support, including organization of service
forces, control of resources and equipment, personnel management, unit
logistics, individual and unit training, readiness, mobilization,
demobilization, discipline, and other matters not included in the operational
missions of the subordinate or other organizations. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.13.3.2.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>Administrative control is a
service command authority, and flows through service, not joint, channels. This
authority is not an operational command authority but provides the requisite
authority for Services to execute their individual “organize, train, and equip”
functions. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">4.13.4. All National Guard and Reserve forces (except those
specifically exempted) are assigned by the Secretary of Defense to the
combatant commands. However, those forces are available for operational missions
only when mobilized for specific periods, by law, or when ordered to Regular
Air Force after being validated for employment by their parent service.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">4.14. Joint Force Organization: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">4.14.1. Joint forces are established at three levels:
unified commands, subordinate unified commands, and joint task forces, and can
be established on either a geographic area or functional basis (Figure 4.2).
These organizations are commanded by a joint force commander. A joint force
commander is a general term applied to a combatant commander, subunified
commander, or joint force commander authorized to exercise combatant command
(command authority) or operational control over a joint force. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.14.1.1.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>A unified command is a
command with broad continuing missions under a single commander, composed of
forces from two or more military departments, and established by the President,
through the Secretary of Defense, with the advice and assistance of the
Chairman, Joint Chief of Staff. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.14.1.2.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>A specified command is a
command that has broad continuing missions and is established by the President,
through the Secretary of Defense, with the advice and assistance of the
Chairman, Joint Chief of Staff. Currently, there are no specified commands
designated. </p>

<p class="msonormal34"><span class="calibre7"><img border="0" src="image002.png" class="calibre9"/></span> </p>

<p class="msonormal35"> </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.14.1.3.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>When authorized by the
Secretary of Defense through the Chairman, Joint Chief of Staff, commanders of
unified commands may establish subordinate unified commands to conduct
operations on a continuing basis using the criteria set forth for unified
commands. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.14.1.4.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>A joint task force is a
joint force that is constituted and so designated by the Secretary of Defense,
a combatant commander, a subordinate unified commander, or an existing joint
task force commander. A joint task force may be established on a geographical
area or functional basis when the mission has a specific limited objective and
does not require overall centralized control of logistics. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">4.14.2. The key to successful employment of Air Force forces
as part of a joint force effort is providing a single Air Force commander with
the responsibility and authority to properly organize, train, equip and employ
Air Force forces to accomplish assigned functions and tasks. The title of this
commander is Commander, Air Force Forces. Operationally, the Commander, Air
Force Forces should be prepared to employ Air Force forces as directed by the
joint force commander, and if directed be prepared to employ joint air forces
as the joint force air component commander. In either event, the Commander, Air
Force Forces should also ensure that Air Force forces are prepared to execute
the missions assigned by the joint force commander. The requirements and
responsibilities of the COMAFFOR and joint force air component commander are
inextricably linked; both are critical to operational success. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.14.2.1.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>Although all Air Force
units, regardless of level, have an Air Force commander, the title of
Commander, Air Force Forces is reserved exclusively to the single Air Force
commander of an Air Force Service component assigned or attached to a joint
force commander at the unified combatant command, subordinate unified command,
or joint task force level. The Secretary of Defense/combatant commander may
elect to permanently establish a subordinate unified command or temporarily
establish a subordinate joint task force as part of his/her organizational
structure. The commanders of these subordinate joint forces are, by joint and
Air Force doctrine, joint force commanders at a lower level than the combatant
commander. If Air Force forces are assigned or attached to subordinate joint
force commanders, that action creates an Air Force Service component with a
separate Commander, Air Force Forces directly responsible to the appropriate
joint force commander. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.14.2.2.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>The Commander, Air Force
Forces should normally be designated at a command level above the operating
forces and should not be dual-hatted as commander of one of the subordinate
operating units. This allows the Commander, Air Force Forces to focus at the
operational level of war, while subordinate commanders lead their units at the
tactical level.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.14.2.3.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>The Commander, Air Force
Forces commands the Air Force Service component to the joint force commander.
At the combatant command or subordinate unified command level this is normally
a standing permanently assigned organization. At the joint task force level the
Air Force Service component will normally be an air expeditionary task force.
At whatever level, the Air Force Service component   presents a joint force
commander with a task-organized, integrated package with the appropriate
balance of force, sustainment, control, and force protection. Every Air Force
Service component presents a scalable, tailorable organization with three
elements: a single commander, embodied in the Commander, Air Force Forces;
appropriate command and control mechanisms; and tailored and fully supported
forces. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.14.2.4.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>The air expeditionary task
force will be tailored to the mission; this includes not only forces, but also
the ability to command and control those forces for the missions assigned. When
forming an air expeditionary task force, the Commander, Air Force Forces should
draw first from in-theater resources, if available. If augmentation is needed,
or if in-theater forces are not available, the Air Force will draw as needed from
the AEF currently on rotation. These forces, whether in-theater or deployed
from out of theater, should be fully supported with the requisite maintenance,
logistical support, health services, and administrative elements. These forces
will form up within the air expeditionary task force as expeditionary wings,
groups, squadrons, flights, detachments, or elements, as necessary to provide
reasonable spans of control and command elements at appropriate levels and to
provide unit identity. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.14.2.5.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>Air expeditionary task
force command and control mechanisms are in place and are usually known as an
air operations center. An air operations center may be regional or functional,
aligning with the purpose of the unified command they support. The Commander,
Air Force Forces requires command activities as tools to assist in exercising
operational control, tactical control, and administrative control. The
Commander, Air Force Forces uses an air operations center to exercise control
of air and space operations, and a service component staff (commonly called the
Air Force forces staff) to exercise support operations and administrative
control. The character of the operations center may vary, depending on the
nature of the forces. For air mobility operations, the operations center may be
the 618th Air Operations Center (formerly the Tanker Airlift Control Center) at
Scott Air Force Base, while space operations would leverage the 614th Air
Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.14.2.6.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>An air expeditionary task
force also needs a command entity responsible for the deployment and
sustainment of Air Force forces. The Air Force forces staff is the mechanism
through which the Commander, Air Force Forces exercises service
responsibilities. These sustainment activities are sometimes referred to as
“beds, beans, and bullets.” The Air Force forces staff is also responsible for
the long-range planning and theater engagement operations that fall outside the
air operation center’s current operational focus. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.14.2.7.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>The core capabilities of
the air operations center and Air Force forces staff should be
well-established, but tailored in size and function according to the theater
and the operation. Not all operations require a full-up air operations center
with over 1,000 people or a large Air Force forces staff. Smaller operations,
such as some humanitarian operations, can make do with a small control center
that does little more than scheduling and reporting. </p>

<p class="msonormal36">4.14.3. Combatant commanders and commanders of subordinate
unified commands and joint task force commanders have the authority to
establish functional component commands to control military operations (Figure
4.3). Joint force commanders may decide to establish a functional component
command to integrate planning; reduce their span of control; and/or
significantly improve combat efficiency, information flow, unity of effort,
weapon systems management, component interaction, and control over the scheme
of maneuver. </p>

<p class="msonormal38"><img border="0" id="Picture 979117" src="image003.png" class="calibre12"/></p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.14.3.1.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>If air assets from more
than one service are present within a joint force, the joint force commander
normally will designate a joint force air component commander to exploit the
full capabilities of joint air operations. The a joint force air component
commander should be the service component commander with the preponderance of
air capabilities and the ability to plan, task, and control joint air
operations. If working with allies in a coalition or alliance operation, the
joint force air component commander may be designated as the combined force air
component commander. Both joint and U.S. Air Force doctrine state that one
individual will normally be dual-hatted as commander, Air Force forces and a
joint force air component commander/combined force air component commander. The
U.S. Air Force prefers<b class="calibre1">—</b>and in fact, plans and trains<b class="calibre1">—</b>to employ
through a commander, Air Force forces who is then prepared to assume
responsibilities as aa joint force air component commander if so designated.
The joint force air component commander recommends the proper employment of air
forces from multiple components. The a joint force air component commander also
plans, coordinates, allocates tasks, executes, and assesses air and space
operations to accomplish assigned operational missions. Because of the wide
scope of air operations, the joint force air component commander will typically
maintain the same joint operating area/theater-wide perspective as the joint
force commander. The joint force air component commander, as with any component
commander, should not also be dual-hatted as the joint force commander. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.14.3.2.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span>Functional component
commanders normally exercise tactical control of forces made available to them
by the joint force commander. Thus, a Commander, Air Force Forces exercises
operational control of Air Force forces and, acting as a joint force air
component commander, normally exercises tactical control of any Navy, Army,
Marine, and coalition air assets made available for tasking (i.e., those forces
not retained for their own service’s organic operations). </p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1">4.15. Joint Operation Planning. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">Joint operation planning consists of planning activities
associated with joint military operations by combatant commanders and their
subordinate joint force commanders in response to contingencies and crises.
Joint operation planning transforms national strategic objectives into
activities by development of operational products that include planning for the
mobilization, deployment, employment, sustainment, redeployment, and
demobilization of joint forces. Furthermore, joint operation planning ties the
military instrument of national power to the achievement of national security
goals and objectives and is essential to securing strategic end states across
the range of military operations. Planning begins with the end state in mind,
providing a unifying purpose around which actions and resources are focused. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.15.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Joint operation planning provides a common basis for discussion,
understanding, and change for the joint force, its subordinate and higher
headquarters, the joint planning and execution community, and the national
leadership. The APEX system facilitates iterative dialogue and collaborative
planning between the multiple echelons of command to ensure that the military
instrument of national power is employed in accordance with national
priorities, and that the plan is continuously reviewed and updated as required
and adapted according to changes in strategic guidance, resources, or the
operational environment. Joint operation planning also identifies capabilities
outside Department of Defense required for achieving the strategic objectives
to reach the end state by providing a forum that facilitates the
inter-organizational coordination that enables unified action. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.15.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>The APEX system operates in a networked, collaborative
environment, which facilitates dialogue among senior leaders, concurrent and
parallel plan development, and collaboration across multiple planning levels.
The joint planning and execution community uses the APEX system to monitor,
plan, and execute mobilization, deployment, employment, sustainment,
redeployment, and demobilization activities associated with joint operations.
Clear strategic guidance and frequent interaction between senior leaders and
planners promote early understanding of, and agreement on, planning
assumptions, considerations, risks, and other key factors. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.15.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>In peacetime, combatant commanders develop campaign plans to
delineate their strategies for ongoing, steadystate operations intended to
deliver continuing strategic advantage to the U.S. and its allies. Planners
develop branch and sequel plans to these campaign plans to cover particular
potential contingencies within their areas of responsibility. These contingency
plans can be elaborated into one of four levels of detail, each with
characteristic planning products: </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.15.3.1.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Commander’s Estimate</b>.
Produces multiple potential courses of action to address the contingency and
complete the mission. It contains the supported commander’s evaluation of the
potential courses of action along with a recommended courses of action. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.15.3.2.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Base Plan</b>. This
describes a concept of operations that addresses the contingency, based on a
selected course of action. It identifies major forces involved, the concept of
support, and anticipated timelines for completing the mission (often expressed
in “lines of effort”). It normally does not contain annexes or timephased force
deployment data. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.15.3.3.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Concept of Plan</b>.
This is an operation plan in abbreviated format. It normally includes a plan
summary, a base plan, and several crucial annexes (such as those delineating
command relations and interagency coordination requirements.). It may or may
not include a time-phased force deployment data. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.15.3.4.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Operation Plan</b>. A
complete and detailed joint plan containing a comprehensive description of the
concept of operations, including identification of specific forces, functional
support, and resources required; all annexes applicable to the plan; and a
time-phased force deployment data. It can be quickly developed in to an
operation order. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">4.15.4. In a crisis, the joint planning and execution
community employs combat air patrol to accomplish planning in a time-sensitive
manner, producing orders that describe the mission, situation, and objectives;
establish command relationships; identify planning assumptions; and identify
and/or task forces and strategic mobility resources, or request them. The types
of joint operation orders are: </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.15.4.1.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Warning Order</b>.

Issued as needed to change or modify an operation order execution. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">4.15.5. Planning is conducted at every echelon of command
and across the range of military operations. Joint operation planning employs
an integrated process for orderly analytical, and coordinated problem solving
and decision-making known as the joint operation planning process. In its
peacetime application, the process is highly structured to support the thorough
and fully coordinated development of deliberate plans. In crisis, the process
can be shortened as needed to support the dynamic requirements of changing
events. In wartime, the process adapts to accommodate greater decentralization
of joint operation planning activities. Joint operation planning process
consists of a set of logical steps to examine a mission; develop, analyze, and
compare alternative course of actions, select the best course of action,
develop a concept of operations, and produce a plan or order.  <b class="calibre1">Joint
operation planning process is thus the process used to derive all the types of
plans—and many of the orders—described above.</b> <b class="calibre1">Joint operation planning
process is also the process used to derive subordinate plans for employment and
support of forces, including those created for use by Air Force forces. </b>Joint
operation planning process consists of seven steps: </p>

<p class="msonormal43"><span class="calibre3">4.15.5.1.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Planning Initiation</b>.
An appropriate authority (such as the President, Secretary of Defense, or
combatant commander) recognizes potential for employing military capability in
a particular contingency or crisis and decides to develop military options. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.15.5.2.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Mission Analysis</b>. A
crucial output of this step is the mission statement: The joint force’s mission
is the task, or set of tasks, together with the purpose, that indicates the
action to be taken and the reason for doing so. Key mission analysis activities
include such things as review of initial planning guidance and intelligence;
developing the mission statement; determining known facts and developing
planning assumptions; conducting an initial force allocation review; and
developing mission success criteria (measures of effectiveness for the
mission). Mission analysis concludes with a mission analysis brief to the

Development</b>. A course of action is a potential way (solution, method) to
accomplish the assigned mission. Staffs develop course of actions to provide
unique choices to the commander, all oriented on accomplishing the military end
state. course of actions describe <i class="calibre2">who</i> will take action, <i class="calibre2">what type</i>
of military action will take place, <i class="calibre2">when </i>the action will occur, <i class="calibre2">where</i>
the action will occur, <i class="calibre2">why </i>the action is required (the purpose), and <i class="calibre2">how
</i>the action will take place (the method of employment of forces). Each
course of action should explain the objectives, end state, key tasks, and task
organization. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.15.5.4.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Course of Action
Analysis</b>. This step closely examines potential course of actions to reveal
details that will allow the commander and staff to evaluate them in order to
identify advantages and disadvantages.  The primary means of conducting this
analysis is wargaming. Wargaming is a conscious effort to visualize the flow of
an operation, given friendly and adversary dispositions, capabilities,
strengths, and possible course of actions. A critical element of wargaming is
the “red team/cell,” which role-plays and models the adversary, aggressively
pursuing the adversary’s point of view and objectives. Wargaming can be as
simple as a turn-byturn table-top affair, or as complex as a Department of
Defense-adjudicated game hosted on mainframe computers. Wargaming allows the
planning staff and commander to asses each course of action for feasibility— to
answer questions like, “can it be supported?” “Is more combat capability need?”
“Can the adversary effectively counter or prevent friendly action?” The outputs
of this step feed the next: </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.15.5.5.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Course of Action
Comparison</b>. Comparison is a subjective process whereby the course of action
are independently evaluated against a set of criteria established by the
commander and staff. This step should identify and recommend the course of
action that has the greatest probability of success against the adversary
course of action that is of most concern to the commander. Often, the staff
develops an evaluation matrix that compares all the friendly course of action
against the established set of criteria; this may help identify the best course
of action. Ultimately, the staff develops a brief recommending their selection
for “best” course of action. </p>

<p class="msonormal44"><span class="calibre3">4.15.5.6.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Course of Action
Approval</b>. In this step, the staff briefs the commander on the course of
action comparison and wargaming results and recommends a course of action for
approval.  The commander may approve the course of action or modify it, or
direct the staff to reiterate portions of the joint operation planning
process.  From the final course of action selection, the commander and staff
prepare a commander’s estimate (previously described) and direct further plan
or order development. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.15.5.7.<span class="calibre4"> </span></span><b class="calibre1">Plan or Order
Development</b>. The commander’s staff and subordinate functional or Service
component staffs develop more detailed plans, supporting plans, or orders, as
required by the mission (and as described above). </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.15.6.<span class="calibre4">  </span></span>For
further information concerning the joint force and planning, see Joint
Publication 5-0, <i class="calibre2">Joint Operation Planning. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.15.7.<span class="calibre4">  </span></span>Subordinate
and supporting commands and staffs use the JOPP process to create their own
plans and orders.  <b class="calibre1">When the Air Force Service component or the joint force
air component accomplish this process, it is known as the joint operation
planning process for air</b>. When the joint force air component accomplishes
the joint operation planning process for air, it produces a plan known as the
joint air operations plan, or joint air operations plan.  During execution, the
joint air operations plan is divided into time-defined (usually daily) “slices”
known as air operation directives.  Air operation directives, then, are the
basis for the daily air tasking orders, which govern accomplishment of the air
tasking and targeting cycles—the mechanisms of joint air employment of forces.
Following execution, these cycles guide the staffs and commander through
assessment of operations: “Are we doing the right things and are we doing
things right in order to accomplish the mission?” “What is our progress toward
accomplishment?” The Air Force Service component produces an Air Force Service
component plan to support the joint force air component and the joint force
overall. Most all of the planning described in this paragraph takes place in
the air operations center, or air operation center, although some Service
component planning may take place elsewhere.  For more information on Air Force

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.16.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>As our Nation and armed forces are confronted with a multitude of
priorities, from a shrinking force and limited resources, to fiscal
constraints, we must be mindful to advance only the necessary resources to
ensure that the right capabilities are integrated and interoperable across all
domains of air, space, and cyberspace. Competing priorities today must now be
carefully measured against all military capabilities, ensuring that quality—not
necessarily quantity—smartly contributes to a faster, more flexible, agile and
response force. That said, we must rely on the strengths of others, or be
interdependent, and meanwhile ensure all capabilities can effectively
intertwine, or be interoperable with each other to achieve an overarching
objective. One of the founding initiatives, which addressed joint
interdependence and joint interoperability, was the Goldwater-Nichols
Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.16.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>One of the first successful operational actions of combining
joint and coalition integration was experienced during Operations DESERT SHIELD
and DESERT STORM. These operations demonstrated an unmistakable fashion the
value and effectiveness of joint and combined military operations. The unique
capabilities of each of the U.S. military Services, and those of each of our
allies, were exploited during various phases of both operations. The combined
force provided a synergistic combat capability which brought the greatest
possible military power of the coalition force to bear against the opponent.
Likewise, our experience also reaffirmed the importance of joint and combined
training, the value of forward presence and the validity of joint force
sequencing for power-projection. A good example of this was through the use of
the Air Force’s domain of space. After the Gulf War there was a near unanimous
agreement that space-based systems greatly increased the overall effectiveness
of coalition forces. </p>

<p class="msonormal48"><span class="calibre3">4.16.3.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Clearly, history proved that collectively, the strengths,
resources, and training of one Service or nation in today’s increasingly
complex environment, increases and/or balances the successful outcome of a
military objective. This was seen in Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan…throughout
all aspects of the global war on terrorism and through other worldwide security
challenges. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.16.4.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>The U.S. Air Force’s unity of effort, through the application of
air, space, and cyberspace, provides unique capabilities that bridge a
comprehensive joint and coalition approach. This unity of effort involves the
coordination and cooperation toward common objectives, even if the participants
are not necessarily part of the same command or organization, but the product
of successful unified action (Joint Publication 1-02). </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.16.5.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Our doctrine continues to evolve; we now rarely see any one
Service or any one country unilaterally plan, organize, or execute an
operation, but we see inclusiveness with joint, coalition, and sometimes
interagency partners, whereby we depend on each other to succeed in today’s
complex environment. Through this interdependence we are able to select the
right resources and capabilities from each other. These capabilities simply do
not get used when a contingency arises, but are synergized and tested through
such venues as exercises and operations to ensure all joint, and when necessary,
coalition partners can meet the desired objectives at the right time and right
place. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.16.6.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Each Service and coalition brings a unique balance to every
operation and, depending upon the circumstances, the balance may shift from one
Service or nation due to the different operating environments and applications
necessary to support the best options. Our Air Force tenet of centralized
control, decentralized execution is a great example of this. When employing
strategic air attack as a line of operations, which defines the interior or
exterior orientation of the force in relation to the enemy or that connects
actions on nodes and/or decisive points related in time and space to an
objective, we will require a high degree of centralization under an air commander,
known as the joint force air component commander. The joint force air component
commander must have authority over all forces, foreign or domestic, to direct
operations, including attack sequencing and make adjustments as operations
unfold. On the contrary, if tactical air operations are necessary to support
ground troops using close air support, these air resources are best when
decentralized to support ground commanders. The tenet of Airpower is never
prosecuted alone, but space and cyberspace, which belongs to no one state,
remains a vital imperative for joint force operations. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.16.7.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>A good example of this was played out during Operation ODYSSEY
DAWN over Libya in 2011. During this operation, the joint and combined
operations provided one of the greatest uses of joint and coalition
capabilities in our recent history. In an effort to support multi-national
efforts necessary to protect civilians in Libya from attacks by the regime of
Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi, the U.S. Africa Command task force was assigned
to provide operational and tactical command and control of U.S. military forces
supporting the international response to the unrest in Libya and enforcement of
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. At the start of operations,
U.S. Africa Command, commanded by General Carter Ham, exercised strategic
command. Tactical command in the theater of operations was executed from USS <i class="calibre2">Mount
Whitney </i>in the Mediterranean Sea under supported command of Admiral Sam
Locklear, Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Africa. U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert
Gates indicated that control of the operation would be transferred to French
and British authorities, or North Atlantic Treaty Organization, within days.
The Joint Task Force was called Joint Task Force ODYSSEY DAWN. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.16.8.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>As a joint team, the supporting commands (commanders) were the
Joint Force Maritime Component Commander Vice Admiral Harry B. Harris who
controlled maritime assets aboard the USS <i class="calibre2">Mount Whitney,</i> and Joint Force
Air Component Commander Major General Margaret Woodward. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre3">4.16.9.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>As the Libyans began joining other Arab populations across North
Africa in conducting antigovernment protests and demonstrations, time passed
and the Qadhafi regime increasingly began to use military force against its
citizens in efforts to repress the uprising. The Arab League meeting in Cairo
asked the United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Libya to
protect civilians from air attack and declaring that the Qadhafi government had
lost its sovereignty. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution
1973 authorizing all necessary measures to protect civilians in Libya. The
resolution authorized the use of force and the enforcement of a no-fly zone
over Libya. The U.S. Secretary of Defense approved and ordered the use of U.S.
military forces in strikes against the government of Libya. The International
Coalition took measures to begin enforcement of United Nations Security Council
Resolution 1973, to include the imposition of a no-fly zone, launched strikes
against Libyan military sites and air defense systems. </p>

<p class="msonormal49"><span class="calibre3">4.16.10.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>To illustrate effective interdependence and interoperability, the
following joint and coalition capabilities over </p>

<p class="msonormal49">Libya was a good example. The following representation was
captured within the first few days of Operation </p>

<p class="msonormal4">ODYSSEY DAWN: </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre3">4.16.10.1.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>As Major General Woodward commanded the air campaign, French
aircraft destroyed four Libyan tanks in air strikes to the southwest of the
city of Benghazi. The French military claimed that its aircraft had also flown
reconnaissance missions over all Libyan territory. On the same day, British
Prime Minister David Cameron confirmed that Royal Air Force jets were also in
action and reports suggested that the U.S. Navy had fired the first cruise
missile. CBS News correspondent David Martin reported that three B-2 stealth
bombers from Whiteman Air Force base Missouri flew nonstop from the U.S. to
drop 40 bombs on a major Libyan airfield. Martin further reported that U.S.
fighter jets were searching for Libyan ground forces to attack. The Pentagon
and the British Ministry of Defense confirmed that, jointly, British ship HMS <i class="calibre2">Triumph
</i>and U.S. Navy ships (including USS <i class="calibre2">Barry</i>) and submarines fired more
than 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles, supported with air attacks on military
installations, both inland and on the coast. Days later, several Storm Shadow
missiles were launched by British jets. Nineteen U.S. planes conducted strike
operations in Libya. The planes included Marine Corps AV-8B Harriers, U.S. Navy
EA-18G Growlers, which were diverted from operations over Iraq and jammed
Libyan radar and communications, and Air Force F-15 and F-16 fighter jets. A
military convoy was destroyed south of Benghazi by air strikes. Seventy
military vehicles were destroyed and multiple loyalist ground troop casualties
were also reported. Four Danish F-16 fighters left Italy’s Sigonella Air Base
for a successful 5-hour long high-risk mission, and four Italian Tornados
(electronic combat/reconnaissance), accompanied by four Italian aircraft.
Operations continued and on 31 March 2011 at 0600 Greenwich Mean Time, North
Atlantic Treaty Organization took command of all operations in Libya with
subsequent operations being conducted as part of North Atlantic Treaty
Organization-driven operation unified protector. </p>

<p class="msonormal50"><span class="calibre3">4.16.10.2.<span class="calibre4"> 
</span></span>Operation ODYSSEY DAWN was a complete success and supported the
necessity of, not only joint and coalition capabilities, but how air, space,
and cyberspace domains intertwined all facets of the operation to guarantee
success. General Dempsey said it best when he stated [Joint and Coalition] <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">“means
building and presenting forces that can be molded to context—not just by adding
and subtracting, but by leaders combining capabilities in innovative ways. It
means interdependence services that rely on each other to achieve objectives
and create capabilities that do not exist except when combined. It means a
regionally postured, but globally networked and flexible force that can be
scaled and scoped to demand.”</i></b> </p>

<p class="msonormal51">4.16.11. Today, not one military contingency or operation,
whether in peacetime or wartime, can optimize its objective without space or
cyberspace. Airpower offers speed, agility, flexibility, range, and
responsiveness to virtually every need, and airpower has demonstrated its
success to meet our homeland and international security challenges by
leveraging our respective capabilities and maximizing resulting synergy. Cyber
operations guarantee our capability to operate in any contested cyber domain to
support vital land, sea, air, and space missions by developing capabilities to
protect essential military cyber systems and to speed their recovery if an
attack does occur. In these interdependent domains the Air Force possesses
unique capabilities for ensuring global mobility, long-range strike, and
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The benefits of airpower extend
beyond the air domain, and operations among the air, land, maritime, space, and
cyber domains are increasingly interdependent upon each other for the success
of any and all national military objectives. Together, the domains of air,
space, and cyberspace, effectively combined with joint and coalition
capabilities, has proven to be the most valuable means of supporting the
National Security Strategy of the U.S. and our allies.<b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2"> </i></b></p>

monitor, plan, assess, and execute joint operations. APEX formally integrates
the strategic-theater and operational planning activities of the Joint Planning
and Execution Community and facilitates the joint force commander’s seamless
transition from planning to execution during times of crises. APEX activities
span many organizational levels, including the interaction between Secretary of
Defense and Combatant Commanders, which ultimately helps the President and
Secretary of Defense decide when, where, and how to commit U.S. military
forces. APEX is used to facilitate the joint operation planning process.  </p>

adaptation of approved operation plans during crisis. Joint operation planning
allows for the effective management of operations in execution across the spectrum
of mobilization, deployment, employment, sustainment, redeployment and
demobilization. Joint operation planning is supported by a networked suite of
automated data processing applications, tools, and databases, which reside on

<p class="msonormal98">This chapter documents the lives and activities of Airmen so
you, the reader, will gain an understanding of what it means to be an Airman.
From Kitty Hawk to Afghanistan 108 years later, the United States Air Force has
grown into the finest Air Force in the world. You can take pride in the efforts
and accomplishments of enlisted pioneers of the United States Air Force and its
predecessor organizations who, through their own sacrifices, made the Air Force
enlisted corps what it is today. Without their many contributions, none of that
would have been possible.</p>

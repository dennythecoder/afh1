<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre1">AIR FORCE HERITAGE </b></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 1A—Overview </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">1.1.
Introduction. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">As preparation for your entry into the
Air Force, this section will introduce the Air Force mission and their evolution,
the machines and technology associated with air and space flight and most
importantly, the legacy of the men and women of the United States Air Force. By
surveying the history of aviation, you will discover our heritage, appreciate
Air Force traditions, and understand your role in our nation’s defense. This
United States Air Force Historical Perspective is by Dr. John T. Farquhar from
the United States Air Force Academy Department of History and contributing
editor George W. Bradley III, the Air Force Space Command Historian. The
enlisted portions of this document were provided by the Air Force Enlisted
Heritage Research Institute’s historian, Mr. William I. Chivalette. Dr. John Q.
Smith, Senior Air Force Historian, assisted with additional editing. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre3"><i class="calibre4">Section 1B—Dawn of Flight, Early Days of Aviation, First Air War
and the 1920s and 1930s Airpower</i></b> <b class="calibre3">1.2. The Dawn of Flight: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.2.1. The dream of flight recurs in myth
and legend from ancient times, but not until two French brothers, Joseph Michel
and Jacques Etienne Montgolfier, launched a hot air balloon on 15 October 1783,
with passenger Jean François Pilatre de Rozier, did man first “fly.” The
military potential of aviation was noted in 1794, when the French “Aerostatic
Corps” balloons accompanied the armies of the French Revolution until 1798. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre5"><img id="_x0000_i1159" src="image001.png" class="calibre6"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2"><span class="calibre7">Inflating
the Civil War balloon Intrepid, 1862</span></i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal8"> </p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.2.2. In September 1861, a “Balloon Corps”
provided aerial observation for the Union Army during the American Civil War.
However, the early balloons proved fragile, vulnerable to weather, and of
limited value.  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.2.3. Aviation languished in the United
States, but in Europe, balloons, gliders, and aerodynamics advanced rapidly. By
1853, Britain’s Sir George Cayley created a glider with fixed wings, cambered airfoil,
and horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Continuing Cayley’s work, German
engineer Otto Lilienthal produced flying machines similar to today’s hang
gliders. From 1891 until his death five years later, Lilienthal greatly
advanced aerodynamic theory. The publicity generated by Lilienthal spurred on
imaginative people on both sides of the Atlantic, including Orville and Wilbur
Wright. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.2.4. The Wrights furthered Lilienthal’s
experiments with the assistance of American Octave Chanute, whose book, <i class="calibre2">Progress
in Flying Machines</i>, provided their foundation in aeronautics. From 1900 to
1902, the Wrights conducted more than 1,000 glides from Kill Devil Hills near
Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. After perfecting wing warping, elevators and
rudders, and a water-cooled engine, they attempted the first powered flight on
14 December 1903. On that try, the aircraft stalled upon takeoff and crashed
three seconds later. Success came at 10:35, on 17 December 1903, when Orville
Wright flew 120 feet in 12 seconds. Alternating pilot duties, the brothers made
three more flights with Wilbur flying 852 feet and staying aloft 59 seconds on
the fourth attempt. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.2.5. American military authorities
rejected the Wrights’ flyer, reacting in part to the highly publicized failure
of Samuel P. Langley’s steam-powered Aerodrome in October 1903. Although a
highly respected scientist and Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
Langley and the Army were subjected to public ridicule and Congressional
criticism for the “waste” of a $50,000 government grant. Only when President
Theodore Roosevelt intervened was an aeronautical division established in the
United States Army’s Signal Corps on 1 August 1907. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.2.6. With the establishment of an
aeronautical division the army was in possession of several balloons. The Army
required trained enlisted men to conduct balloon inflations and effect
necessary repairs. Effective 2 July 1907, Eddy Ward and Jason Barrett reported
to the Leo Stevens’ balloon factory in New York City. They would become the first
enlisted men assigned to the Signal Corps’ small Aeronautical Division, which
in time evolved into the United States Air Force enlisted corps. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre5"><img id="_x0000_i1158" src="image002.png" class="calibre8"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal9"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre7">The enlisted men of  the 1908</span></b>

Eldred; (middle row) Pvt. Stewart K. Rosenberger, Corporal Edward Ward, Pvt.
Cecil R. Colle, Pvt. William E. McConnell. Seated are Pvt. John Crotty (left)
and Pvt. Benjamin Schmidt. </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal9"> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.2.7. When Ward and Barrett reported, the division did not
officially exist. The Army had disbanded the minuscule Civil War balloon
service in 1863, and the corps’ attempts to revive military aviation met with
little success. At the balloon factory, the two men were schooled in the
rudiments of fabric handling, folding, and stitching; in the manufacturing of
buoyant gases; and in the inflation and control of the Army’s “aircraft.” </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.2.8. On 13 August 1907, Ward and Barrett were ordered to
report to Camp John Smith outside Norfolk, Virginia, to participate in the
Jamestown Exposition celebrating the 300th anniversary of the first settlement
of Virginia. Over the next few years, the detachment participated in numerous
air shows and moved from location to location. Barrett left the Army to
complete a career in the Navy, but the enlisted detachment was soon expanded to
include eight others. These nine men were the nucleus from which America’s
enlisted air arm grew. They were the first of a small band of enlisted Airmen
who, during the decade before World War I, shared in the experimental and
halting first steps to establish military aviation as a permanent part of the
Nation’s defense. Never numbering more than a few hundred individuals, the
enlisted crews of the Signal Corps’ Aeronautical Division provided day-to-day
support for a handful of officer pilots, learned the entirely new skills of
airplane “mechanician”—and later, mechanic, rigger, and fitter—met daunting
transportation and logistical challenges, and contributed mightily to the era’s
seat-of-the-pants technological advances. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.2.9. A few enlisted men, against official and
semi-official military prejudice, learned to fly. The majority of enlisted men
were absorbed in the tasks of getting the fragile balloons and even flimsier
planes of the day into the air and keeping them there. Of necessity flexible
and innovative, early crews often had to rebuild aircraft from the ground up
after every crash—and, in those early days of flight; crashes were the rule
rather than the exception. Enlisted crews not only repaired the planes, they
labored to make some of the more ill-designed craft airworthy in the first
place. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">1.3.
The Early Days of the United States Army Aviation (1907-1917): </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11"> </p>

<p class="msonormal12"><span class="calibre5"><img id="_x0000_i1157" src="image003.png" class="calibre9"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal11"> </p>

<p class="msonormal13"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre7">        Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk</span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">1.3.1. By December 1907,
the new Aeronautical Division of the Signal Corps established specifications
for an American military aircraft. The flying machine had to carry two people
(with a combined weight of 350 pounds or less), and fly for 125 miles at an
average speed of 40 miles per hour (mph). The Army received 41 bids, but only
one, submitted by the Wright brothers, produced a flyable aircraft. By
September 1908, the Wright Type “A” Military Flyer flew for more than an hour
at a maximum altitude of 310 feet, carrying the first military observer,
Lieutenant Frank P. Lahm. A subsequent test on 17 September 1908 resulted in
the first military aviation fatality: Lieutenant Thomas E. Selfridge. On 30
July 1909, pilot Orville Wright and Lieutenant Benjamin D. Foulois flew from Fort
Myer to Alexandria, Virginia, at an average speed of 42.6 mph. The Army
accepted the plane 2 August 1909 and awarded the Wrights $25,000 and a $5,000
bonus.  </p>

<p class="msonormal12"> </p>

<p class="msonormal14">1.3.2. The United States Army’s early air operations were not
promising. In October 1909, Wilbur Wright trained Lieutenants Frank P. Lahm and
Frederic E. Humphreys to fly; on 26 October, they were the first Army pilots to
fly solo. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">By 5 November, they crashed the Army’s plane and within
weeks were transferred out of aviation. In March 1910, Lieutenant Foulois
received orders to become the Signal Corps’ pilot. Chief of the Signal Corps,
Gen James Allen, told him, “Don’t worry. You’ll learn the techniques as you go
along...just take plenty of spare parts and teach yourself to fly.” </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.3.3. United States military aviation was falling behind
Europe. By the end of 1911, the French had produced 353 aviators versus 26
American pilots, of whom only eight were military. By 1913, France and Germany
each had spent $22 million on military aviation; Russia spent $12 million; and
even Belgium spent $2 million, compared to just $430,000 for the United States.
</p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.3.4. Increased appropriations over the ensuing two years
allowed the Army to purchase more aircraft. By October 1912, the Aeronautical
Division had 11 aircraft, 14 flying officers, and 39 enlisted mechanics. On 28
September 1912, one of these mechanics, Corporal Frank Scott, became the first
enlisted person to die in an accident in a military aircraft. A crew chief,
Scott was flying as a passenger when the aircraft’s pilot lost control and the
aircraft dived to earth. Scott Field, now Scott Air Force Base, in Illinois,
was named in his honor. On 5 March 1913, the 1st Aero Squadron (Provisional)
was activated becoming the oldest Air Force squadron. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">1.3.5. After years of testing, improvising, and operating on
little more than dedication and a shoestring, Army aviation finally received
official status by the passage of United States House Resolution 5304 on 18
July 1914. This bill authorized the Signal Corps to establish an aviation
section consisting of 60 officers and 260 enlisted men. The bill created the
military rating of aviation mechanician, which called for a 50 percent pay
increase for enlisted men “instructed in the art of flying” while they were on
flying status. The number of such personnel was limited to 40, and the law
specified that no more than a dozen enlisted men could be trained as aviators. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">1.3.6. America’s first aviation combat experience
demonstrated that the air arm was not prepared. After Francisco “Pancho”
Villa’s Mexican forces raided Columbus, New Mexico, in March 1916, President
Woodrow Wilson ordered the 1st Aero Squadron to accompany a force he was
organizing to protect the border and to apprehend Pancho Villa. The squadron,
commanded by Captain Foulois, sought to provide aerial scouting for the ground
forces. Mustering 11 pilot officers, 82 enlisted men, and one civilian
mechanic, the squadron departed from San Antonio with eight Curtiss JN-3 “Jennies,”
ten trucks, and six motorcycles. On the train, Foulois picked up two enlisted
hospital corpsmen. An officer and 14 enlisted men of the engineering section
joined them. In spite of the 1st Aero Squadron’s reconnaissance flights and
several deliveries of mail and dispatches, readily apparent was the squadron’s
JN type aeroplane was not powerful enough to operate at the 5,000-foot
elevations of the Casa Grande, and mountain weather, dust, and extreme
temperatures wreaked havoc with Foulois’ underpowered, dilapidated Curtis JN-3
Jennies. By 19 April, only two of the eight planes were in working condition.
The rest had fallen victim to landing accidents and forced landings, and all
had suffered from the heat and sand.<b class="calibre1"> </b> </p>

<p class="msonormal14"> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.3.7. After 11 months of fruitless campaigning, the
so-called Punitive Expedition was recalled in February 1917, and Villa
continued to lead rebels in northern Mexico until 1920. Yet, poorly equipped as
it was the 1st Aero Squadron had acquitted itself admirably. In his final
report on the mission, Major Foulois praised his pilots, who because of poor
climbing characteristics of the aircraft, could not carry sufficient food or
even adequate clothing. Foulois also commended the willingness of his pilots to
fly clearly dangerous aircraft. He did not neglect the enlisted personnel; he
praised them for their dedication and willingness to work day and night to keep
the aircraft flying. If the performance was admirable, the fact remains that
the results of this first demonstration of American air power were deeply
disappointing. Yet Foulois and the others learned valuable lessons about the
realities of aviation under field conditions. Adequate maintenance was
essential, as were plenty of backup aircraft, which could be rotated into
service while other airplanes were removed from the line and repaired. Enlisted
and civilian mechanics faced a myriad of problems; in particular, the laminated
wood propellers pulled apart. In response, the mechanics developed a humidor
facility to maximize the life of the props. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">1.3.8. Army brass persisted in discouraging
the training of enlisted men, and if not for officers such as Billy Mitchell
and Hap Arnold, who developed a deep and abiding respect for enlisted personnel
in military aviation, there probably would have been even fewer enlisted
aviators than the law allowed. The Signal Corps authority to train more
enlisted men was largely through the efforts of Mitchell and the National
Defense Act of 3 June 1916. When the United States entered World War I,
however, there were no more than a dozen non-officers qualified as pilots. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">1.4.
The First Air War:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.4.1. Aircraft and aerial warfare evolved
during the first World War, 1914-1918. Observation, artillery spotting, and
reconnaissance emerged as the airplane’s most important war missions. By 1915,
pursuit aircraft were developed to deny the enemy use of the air. After early
attempts to down enemies with handguns, French pilot Roland Garros attached
steel plates to the propeller of his Morane-Saulnier Type L monoplane, enabling
him to fire a machine gun through the propeller arc. He earned wide acclaim as
the war’s first “ace.” When engine trouble forced Garros to land behind enemy
lines on 19 April 1915, the Germans studied his innovation. Dutch-born Anthony
Fokker then created the first true fighter plane, the Fokker Eindecker, using
an interrupter gear to enable a machine gun to fire through the propeller. By
the end of World War I, Airmen had pioneered most of today’s aerial missions,
including photographic reconnaissance, close air support for ground troops,
battlefield interdiction, and day and nighttime strategic bombardment. The
German air service inaugurated long-range strategic bombardment as early as
1915 with their massive Zeppelin dirigibles. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">1.4.2. Despite the importance of reconnaissance and
artillery spotting, fighter pilots captured the public’s imagination.
Newspapers portrayed the daring, skill, and chivalry of the “knights of the
air.” Following Roland Garros, the French produced such aces as Rene Fonck,
with 75 kills, and Georges Guynemer, with 54 aerial victories.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.4.3. Like the allies, Germany publicized “aces” to foster
public support for the war effort. Germany’s first ace, Max Immelmann,
developed a revolutionary technique to reverse direction of an aircraft in
flight. The technique still bears his name. Manfred von Richtofen, perhaps the
most famous ace of all, flew a scarlet Fokker triplane, earning him the name,
“the Red Baron.” Shortly after his 80th victory, Richtofen was shot down and killed
on 21 April 1918. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.4.4. Not to be outdone by the French and Germans, Britain
exulted in the exploits of fighter pilots. Britain’s leading ace, with 73
kills, was Edward “Mick” Mannock, who was killed by ground fire while aiding a
novice wingman. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.4.5. As early as 1915, Americans flew in the European war,
both with the French and the British—though it was the American-manned
Lafayette Escadrille of France that earned the greatest and most enduring fame.
The French air service established the <i class="calibre2">Escadrille Americaine</i> for
American volunteers on 21 March 1916. Later renamed the <i class="calibre2">Lafayette Escadrille</i>,
this squadron flew French Nieuport 17 fighters and provided valuable experience
when the United States entered the war. French-born American Raoul Lufbery shot
down 17 German planes before transferring to the American Air Service, where he
commanded the famous “Hat in the Ring” 94th Aero Squadron, before his death on
19 May 1918. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">1.4.6. A little-acknowledged fact
about the Lafayette Escadrille is the roster of aviators included an enlisted
man who was also an African-American—one of the very few enlisted Americans to
fly in the war Corporal Eugene Bullard was the son of a Georgia former slave.
As a member of the French Foreign Legion, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre
(one of 15 decorations from the French government) and was wounded four times
before the legion gave him a disability discharge. During his convalescence in
Paris, he bet an American $2,000 that he could learn to fly and become a combat
aviator. Corporal Bullard won the bet by completing training and joining the
Lafayette Escadrille. Styling himself the “Black Swallow of Death,” he claimed
two victories. Despite his record of daring and dedication, he was grounded at
the request of American officers attached to the escadrille. When the
escadrille pilots were reorganized and incorporated into the American
Expeditionary Force, Bullard was denied the officer’s commission accorded to
other American escadrille aviators and to most of the handful of white enlisted
men who had earned their wings in regular United States Army outfits. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre7">Corporal
Eugene Bullard        2<sup class="calibre12">nd</sup> Lt.
Frank Luke, Jr.</span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal18"> </p>

<p class="msonormal19"> 1.4.7. Of the 767 United States pilots
and 481 observers in action in 1918, Capt Edward V. “Eddie” Rickenbacker and
Lieutenant Frank Luke, Jr., achieved the most fame. Rickenbacker was a renowned
race car driver before the war. Older than most pilots, the 28-year-old became
America’s “Ace of Aces” with 26 confirmed kills. Frank Luke was the only pilot
awarded the Medal of Honor during the war (Rickenbacker would be awarded one in
1931). Known as the “Arizona Balloon Buster,” Luke downed 14 German balloons
and four aircraft in 17 days. His spectacular career ended on 29 September 1918
during a solo attack, when he shot down three enemy balloons and two aircraft
before enemy ground fire forced him down. Seriously wounded, he died with a
pistol in his hand.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.4.8. Enlisted men flew before, during, and after World War
I—but their status remained vague. On 22 January 1919, the commanding officer
of the Air Mechanics School at Kelly Field sought to clarify the situation by
asking the Office of Military Aeronautics for a definition of “enlisted
aviator” and “aerial flier.” The Kelly commanding officer wanted to know who
exactly was entitled to wear the enlisted aviator insignia on the upper-right
shoulder of his tunic. The reply came on 31 January, “ you are advised that
although uniform regulations and specifications provide for an insignia to be
worn by enlisted aviators, the grade itself has never been created and
consequently there is no one in the service entitled to wear the insignia
provided for such grade.” In other words, enlisted aviators, who had served as
instructors, ferry pilots, test pilots, and mechanical flight-check pilots, did
not exist—at least not officially.</p>

<p class="msonormal12">1.4.9. Vernon Burge
and the handful of World War I enlisted aviators who immediately followed him
were the first of some 3,000 enlisted personnel who would fly between the wars
and into the early months of World War II. The military withheld official
flying status from these men until Congress enacted Public Law 99 in 1941,
which provided for training enlisted “aviation students,” who were “awarded the
rating of pilot and warranted as a staff sergeant.” Late in 1942, however,
Congress passed the Flight Officer Act (Public Law 658), which automatically
promoted sergeant pilots produced by the Staff Sergeant Pilot Program to flight
officers. Thus, the cockpit was effectively reserved “for the commissioned.”
One enlisted pilot, Sergeant William C. Ocker, inspired to fly by watching
Vernon Burge, received his commission in January 1917 and commanded a flight
school in Pennsylvania. However, before this his flying skills made Ocker a
valuable commodity in the Aviation Section. Known as the “Father of Blind
Flight,” Ocker flight-tested modified aircraft, served as a flight instructor,
and was hand-picked to scout various parcels for future airfields near the
Potomac River. One of the tracts he selected became Bolling Field, Washington
District of Columbia. </p>

<p class="msonormal12"> </p>

<p class="msonormal20">1.4.10. Master Sergeant George H.
Holmes was the last of about 2,500 men who graduated from enlisted pilot
training. He became a pilot in 1921 and was eventually promoted to lieutenant
colonel during World War II. When the war ended, he chose to revert to his
enlisted rank of master sergeant. He was the last enlisted pilot to serve and
retired in 1957. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.4.11. In addition to the specialized roles directly
associated with flying, Air Service enlisted personnel<b class="calibre1"> </b>performed a wide
variety of general support functions in administration, mess, transport, and
the medical corps. Construction personnel, who built the airfields, hangars,
barracks, and other buildings, were often the first enlisted men stationed at
various overseas locations.  </p>

<p class="msonormal21">1.4.12. World War I Airmen were not combat soldiers as such,
but enlisted men who stood guard and operated base defense. Given the static
nature of the war, there was relatively little danger of a base being overrun
by ground troops. Air attacks, however, happened frequently. Aerial bombardment
and strafing techniques improved later in the war, and enlisted men received
training in the operation of antiaircraft machine guns. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.4.13. Enlisted personnel also served as
observers for both the aircraft and balloon corps. In this capacity Sergeant
Fred C. Graveline of the 20th Aero Squadron was able to receive the
Distinguished Flying Cross. Graveline served as an observer and aerial gunner
from 30 September to 5 November 1918 on 15 missions in the back seat of a DH-4.
In one 35minute battle in which Graveline remarked he “aged 10 years,” he helped
drive off nearly two dozen German planes, shooting down two. </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1152" src="image008.png" class="calibre16"/></span><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1151" src="image009.png" class="calibre17"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal18"> </p>

<p class="msonormal12">1.4.14. While he was
not an ace, William “Billy” Mitchell emerged as one of the outstanding American
air combat commanders of the war, in essence the first Combined Forces Air
Component Commander, as he directed British, French, and American airpower.
Supremely confident about the efficacy of airpower, Mitchell sometimes clashed
with his superiors, including aviation pioneer General Foulois. Nevertheless,
Foulois recognized Mitchell’s leadership and recommended him for the top combat
position, Chief of Air Service, 1st Army. In September 1918, Mitchell massed
1,481 aircraft of American, French, British, and Italian units to support
General Pershing’s St. Mihiel offensive. Mitchell emphasized concentrated, mass
attacks to overwhelm enemy airpower and punish German ground forces. In four
days, Allied Airmen flew 3,300 combat sorties and dropped 75 tons of explosives.
Lauded as a success by General Pershing, Mitchell refined his tactics during
the Meuse-Argonne offensive of 26 September 1918, where 700 American aircraft
faced 500 German planes. By 1918, based upon his outstanding performance
directing Air Service combat units over the Château-Thierry area, the St.
Mihiel salient, and the Meuse-Argonne, Mitchell earned the Distinguished
Service Cross for valor and temporary promotion to brigadier general.  </p>

<p class="msonormal12"> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.4.15. By the Armistice of 11 November 1918, airpower had
played an important role in the Allied victory. Although observation,
reconnaissance, and artillery spotting remained the most significant missions,
close air support, interdiction, and strategic bombardment showed promise.
Eclipsing all other roles, the image of the glamorous fighter ace with his
brightly painted aircraft, leather jacket, and flying scarf captured public
attention. The Army Air Service destroyed 781 enemy aircraft and 73 balloons at
a cost of 289 American aircraft, 48 balloons, and 569 battle casualties.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.4.16. At the end of the war, more than 190,000 men were
serving in the Air Service, 74,000 of them overseas with the American
expeditionary force. On the same day, the Air Service halted all inductions of
enlisted recruits and began the process of dissolving its forces. Combat groups
and wings in Europe were disbanded immediately, but squadrons remained intact
to serve initially as the basic demobilization unit structures. Since the Air
Service had no clear idea of the authorized final strength for the postwar
peacetime, it cut loose men in wholesale batches. The Army, in general, and the
air service, in particular, took considerable pains to help discharged enlisted
men find jobs after leaving the service. The Army worked closely with Federal
officials to aid veterans and even allowed some men to remain in the service
temporarily beyond their discharge if they had no prospects for work. Air
service commanding officers provided special letters of recommendation to
former mechanics and technically trained enlisted men in an effort to help them
find employment. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.4.17. On 20 May 1918, President Woodrow Wilson issued an
Executive Order that transferred Army aviation from under the Signal Corps
control to the Secretary of War. Later that same month, the Army officially
recognized the Bureau of Aircraft Production and the Division of Military
Aeronautics as the Air Service. World War I showed the difficulty of
coordinating air activities under the existing organization, thus the Army Reorganization
Act of 1920 made the Air Service an official combat arm of the Army. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">1.5.
Controversy and Records, 1920s Airpower:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.5.1. Budget cutbacks reduced the 1918 Air Service from
190,000 men to fewer than 20,000. Likewise, the $460 million allocated for
military aviation in 1919 fell to $25 million in 1920. Even worse from a
technology viewpoint, Congress demanded that new military aircraft use the
surplus Liberty engines produced during the World War I buildup. Consequently,
First World War vintage Curtiss Jennies and Liberty DH-4 bombers remained in
service until the 1930s, despite technological advances in airframe and engine
design. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.5.2. As far back as 1919, while Congress debated the size
of the postwar establishment, the Air Service mounted shows for all occasions.
Scarcely a county fair or patriotic gathering within flying distance of a
military airfield operated without an aerial demonstration. Enlisted mechanics
might lecture on how to repair the Liberty engine, while pilots flew acrobatics
overhead. The traveling air shows, known as circuses, coincided with Victory
Loan rallies and in later years provided entertainment at Armistice Day or
Washington’s Birthday celebrations. Enlisted pilots also took part in air
shows, including a trio of intrepid flying sergeants who in 1923 put together
an act that involved flying a tight “V” formation while their planes were tied
together with cords. Other enlisted pilots offered more routine skills, such as
dropping demonstration smoke bombs. </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1150" src="image010.png" class="calibre18"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.5.3. A concerted effort to achieve records
in speed, altitude, endurance, and other areas helped spur aviation advances in
the 1920s. In September 1922, Lieutenant James “Jimmy” Doolittle became the
first man to fly across the United States in less than a day. Seven months
later, Lieutenants Oakley Kelley and John Macready flew a Fokker T-2 on the
first nonstop transcontinental flight. On 6 April 1924, a team of Army pilots
departed Seattle in four Douglas World Cruisers, christened the <i class="calibre2">Chicago</i>,
<i class="calibre2">Boston</i>, <i class="calibre2">Seattle</i>, and <i class="calibre2">New Orleans</i>, in an effort to fly
around the world. Although the <i class="calibre2">Seattle</i> and <i class="calibre2">Boston</i> were lost to a
mountain crash and engine failure, respectively, the remaining aircraft
completed the circuit 175 days later. In 1925, Jimmy Doolittle achieved further
fame by winning the Schneider Trophy, an over–water seaplane race, and
established a world seaplane record at 245.71 miles per hour. Although less
publicized, Doolittle also played a major role in designing and testing
instruments for all–weather flying, including an altimeter, gyro, artificial
horizon, and radio navigation aids. On 24 September 1929, Doolittle was the
first pilot to take off, fly a set course, and land using instruments alone. </p>

<p class="msonormal21">1.5.4. Air activities through the mid-1920s were relatively
limited and generally focused on establishing records, testing equipment, and
garnering headlines. Master electrician Jack Harding and Sergeant First Class
Jerry Dobias served aboard a Martin bomber that flew “around the rim” of the
country, starting at Bolling Field on 24 July 1919. Totaling 100 flights and
9,823 miles, Dobias kept the effort from ending almost before it began. Almost
immediately after taking off from Bolling, he crawled out on the aircraft’s
left wing, without a parachute, to repair a leaky engine. In 1920, the Air
Corps flew a round-trip flight of four DH-4Bs from Mitchell Field on Long
Island to Nome, Alaska. The flight took three months and covered 9,000 miles
and the safety record was largely attributable to Master Sergeant Albert Vierra. 
</p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1149" src="image011.png" class="calibre19"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.5.5. Toward the end of the decade, Airmen were ready to
demonstrate even more impressive records. New Year’s Day 1929, a team of Airmen
destined for fame took off in a Fokker C-2 featuring a large question mark on
the fuselage. The question was simple: how long could they stay in the air?
Using a crude air refueling technique pioneered in 1923, Major Carl “Tooey”
Spaatz, Capt Ira Eaker, Lieutenant Harry Halverson, Lieutenant Elwood “Pete”
Quesada, and Staff Sergeant Roy Hooe flew the <i class="calibre2">Question Mark</i> 150 hours
and 40 minutes, taking on 5,600 gallons of hand-pumped fuel during 37 air-to
air refuelings, to travel 11,000 miles. This endurance test proved the
unlimited range available with air refueling. The quest for world records in
the 1920s honed the skills of Airmen, advanced aviation technology, and kept
military aviation in the limelight. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">1.5.6. An important group of demonstrations
during the 1920s was more closely related to the airplane as an advanced weapon
of war. As early as the beginning of the decade, Brigadier General Mitchell was
convinced of airpower’s potential as the primary component of national defense
and a war-winning weapon and aggressively promoted his cause to create an
independent Air Force. Hoping to make this the nation’s first line of defense,
he challenged the United States Navy, arguing that bombers rendered battleships
obsolete. Reluctantly, the Navy agreed to allow Mitchell to test his Martin
MB-2 bombers against some captured German ships. Mitchell’s Airmen sank the
27,000-ton battleship, <i class="calibre2">Ostfriesland</i> on 21 July 1921. Despite the
four-layer armored hull and watertight compartments, the battleship eventually
disappeared into the water. Although Mitchell failed to convince the War or
Navy departments, the bombing tests spurred carrier-based aviation development.
</p>

<p class="msonormal23"> </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre5"><img id="_x0000_i1148" src="image012.png" class="calibre20"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal24"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre7">Aerial view of the <i class="calibre2">Ostfriesland</i></span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal18"> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.5.7. Despite previous air service successes, the Navy
remained unconvinced about their vulnerability from the air. Officials
eventually turned over two World War I battleships, the USS <i class="calibre2">New Jersey</i>
(BB-16) and the USS<i class="calibre2"> Virginia,</i> for further testing. A young bombardier,
Sergeant Ulysses “Sam” Nero, earned a slot among the 12 aircrews selected by
General Mitchell to try to sink the battleships. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1147" src="image013.png" class="calibre21"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal26">1.5.8. On 5 September 1923, 11
aircraft reached the targets just off the North Carolina coast—the 12th
returned to base because of engine trouble. Ten of the aircraft dropped their
ordnance far from the <i class="calibre2">New Jersey.</i> Nero, using different tactics than
General Mitchell instructed, scored two hits. General Mitchell disqualified
Nero and his pilot from further competition but reconsidered when the remainder
of the crews failed to hit the <i class="calibre2">Virginia </i>until they dropped down to 1,500
feet. </p>

<p class="msonormal25">1.5.9. Nero and the Martin-Curtiss NBS-1 pilot
approached the <i class="calibre2">New Jersey</i> at 85 miles per hour at an altitude of 6,900
feet, from about 15 degrees off the port beam. Using an open wire site, Nero
dropped his first 600-pound bomb right down the ship’s smokestack. A delayed
explosion lent suspense to the result, but a billowing black cloud signaled the
<i class="calibre2">New Jersey’s</i> demise, which went down in just over three minutes. Having
one bomb left and no <i class="calibre2">New Jersey</i> to drop it on, Nero’s aircraft proceeded
to the floundering <i class="calibre2">Virginia,</i> where Nero proceeded to administer the <i class="calibre2">coup
de grace </i>on the stricken craft—his bomb landed directly on the <i class="calibre2">Virginia’s</i>
deck. General Mitchell promoted Nero during the next cycle. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">1.5.10. Frustrated by what he perceived as a lack of
progress, Mitchell’s public statements were increasingly incendiary. When the
Navy airship <i class="calibre2">Shenandoah</i> crashed on 5 September 1925, Mitchell issued a
press release charging the Department of the Navy and the War Department with
“incompetency, criminal negligence, and almost treasonable administration of
our national defense.” During the ensuing court martial, Mitchell attempted to
transform the trial into a public hearing on airpower. Found guilty of “conduct
of a nature to bring discredit upon the military service,” the court sentenced
Mitchell to a five-year suspension from the service without pay. On 1 February
1926, Mitchell resigned from the Air Service to continue the fight for an
independent air force. Until his death in 1936, Mitchell fought tenaciously for
his vision. He placed his indelible stamp on United States air combat practice
and doctrine with his emphasis on massed forces and offensive operations. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.5.11. Mitchell’s efforts produced some success for the
fledgling Air Corps. The Air Corps Act of 1926 greatly improved the status of
aviation within the Army. This transformed the Air Service into the Air Corps,
provided representation on the General Staff, added an Assistant Secretary of
War for Air, and promised expansion to a force of 1,650 officers, 15,000
enlisted men, and 1,800 serviceable aircraft within five years. However,
funding never matched the goal established. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">1.6.
Air Corps Tactical School and the Rise of the Bomber (1930s Air Corps): </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.6.1. Although technological advances continued into the
1930s, the Great Depression dominated the decade. The technological promise of
all-metal construction, monoplane design, and advanced power plants met the harsh
realities of a shoe-string budget caused by reduced tax revenues and economic
malaise. Toward the latter half of the decade, powerful totalitarian states,
including Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, Nationalist Japan, and the Communist
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, threatened western democracies, but
powerful isolationist sentiment limited the United States military response. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.6.2. Within the Air Corps, leading Airmen emphasized
doctrinal development through the Air Corps Tactical School. Doctrine, the
concepts that are the basis of how to fight, provided ideas for technological
requirements, aircraft procurement, strategy, and tactics. The Air Corps
Tactical School served as the military aviation doctrine center from their
founding in 1920 as the Air Service Field Officer School, Langley Field,
Virginia. In 1922, the school was renamed the Air Service Tactical School
before becoming the Air Corps Tactical School in 1926. Even before the Air
Corps Tactical School moved to Maxwell Field, Alabama, in 1931, the school
attracted the best and brightest Airmen to their faculty, including Harold L.
George, Kenneth Walker, Donald Wilson, George C. Kenney, Haywood S. Hansell,
and Muir S. Fairchild. Influenced by Billy Mitchell, Italy’s Giulio Douhet, and
Britain’s Hugh Trenchard, the Air Corps Tactical School faculty emphasized
long-range strategic bombardment.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.6.3. According to Air Corps Tactical School lectures,
massed bombers would penetrate enemy defenses, bypass field armies and navies,
and strike enemy “vital centers” whose destruction would collapse the enemy’s
economy. Proper target selection would destroy an enemy’s capability and will
to fight. In an era before radar, airpower theorists believed effective air
defense would be impossible. They looked to high altitude, speed, and internal
armament for defense. These ideas ultimately led United States Airmen to
emphasize the high altitude precision daylight bombardment that characterized
much of the air operations during the Second World War. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.6.4. During the interwar period, aircraft mechanics
received formal technical training at Chanute Field, Illinois, at what became
the Air Corps Technical School in 1926. Perhaps the key to the success of the
technical school was the air service system of trade testing. While other
branches of the Army returned to the apprentice system of assignment and
training, the Army Air Corps continued to use and develop a combination of the
Army Alpha Test, aptitude tests, and counseling. Enlisted men who wanted to
apply for technical training had to qualify as high school graduates or the
equivalent and pass a mathematics proficiency test in addition to the alpha
test. Finally, a trade test specialist familiar with the actual work personally
interviewed each enlisted man. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.6.5. Classes at the technical school started in the fall
and usually continued until the following spring. Students had to pay their own
transportation to Illinois and, during some periods, lived in relatively crude
conditions. Still, the training grew in popularity, and by 1938; the technical
school had outgrown Chanute, with new branches opening at Lowry Field near
Denver, Colorado, and at Scott Field in downstate Illinois. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">1.6.6. Enlisted men participated
in a range of experimental work, including altitude flights, blind flying,
aerial photography, and cosmic ray research and the development of the
parachute. Whether they were selected as guinea pigs or because they were just
interested, enlisted men served as the first to try out new parachute designs,
and they eventually took over most of the testing and training. The most
prominent enlisted parachutist was Sergeant Ralph Bottriell who tested the
first backpack-style, freefall parachute on 19 May 1919. Bottriell eventually
became chief parachute instructor at Kelly Field, Texas, and earned the
Distinguished Flying Cross in 1933 for service as an experimental parachute
tester.  </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre7"> </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal19"><span class="calibre5"><img id="_x0000_i1146" src="image014.png" class="calibre22"/></span><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre7"> </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal19"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre7">Sergeant Ralph W. Bottriell</span> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28"> </p>

<p class="msonormal29">1.6.7. Coinciding with Air Corps
Tactical School doctrine, the American aviation industry introduced a series of
advanced bombers that encouraged airpower advocates. In 1931, the Boeing
Airplane Company introduced the B-9, an all-metal, stressed-skin bomber with
retractable landing gear capable of 188 mph. A few months later, the Martin
B-10 overshadowed the open-cockpit B-9. The B-10 also featured an all metal,
monoplane design with retractable landing gear, enclosed cockpit, a glazed gun
turret, variable pitch propellers, wing flaps, and an internal bomb bay with
power-driven doors. On 19 July 1934, Colonel Henry H. “Hap” Arnold led a
squadron of B-10s from Washington, District of Columbia, to Anchorage, Alaska,
covering 4,000 miles in 25 flying hours. Bomber theorists saw this exploit as a
validation of their ideas.</p>

<p class="msonormal29"> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.6.8. In February 1934, a crisis arose that tested both the
leadership and the flying skills of the Air Corps when President Franklin D.
Roosevelt cancelled airmail contracts with civilian airlines. Without a
thorough analysis of Air Corps capabilities, General Foulois asserted that the
Air Corps would pick up the slack until contracts were renewed. However, the
Air Corps underestimated the challenge posed. Army Airmen attempted to fly mail
routes in open-cockpit planes with primitive instruments in one of the worst
winters recorded. In three months, the Air Corps lost 66 aircraft and suffered
18 fatalities. The airmail fiasco forced Foulois to resign and led to a
Congressional investigation known as the Baker Board. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.6.9. The Baker Board scrutinized Air Corps operations and
recommended the creation of a single command for all combat aircraft, known as
General Headquarters Air Force. Brig Gen Frank Andrews assumed command 1 March
1935. Airmen applauded the action as a means to consolidate command, centralize
doctrine, and integrate training. The initial cadre included 17 combat units:
three wings, ten groups, and four squadrons. Today’s Air Combat Command traces
their heritage to General Headquarters Air Force. Among other measures, the
General Headquarters Air Force called for a bomber capable of carrying a
2,000-pound payload for 1,020 miles, at a speed of 200 mph. The Martin and
Douglas companies advanced designs, but the Boeing’s Model 299 was what excited
the General Headquarters Air Force staff. In August 1935, the four-engine
aircraft flew 2,100 miles nonstop from Seattle, Washington, to Dayton, Ohio,
averaging 232 mph. The B-17 “Flying Fortress,” paired with the Norden
bombsight, revolutionized bombardment and promised to validate Air Corps
Tactical School theories.  </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">1.7.
General Headquarters Air Force (1935-1939): </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.7.1. The resulting reorganization established a General
Headquarters Air Force (a measure that set up a tactical air force under the
direct control of the Army General Headquarters but left the day-to-day
organization of the Air Corps mostly intact—a confusing half-step toward an
independent air force) and recognized that technological advances in aircraft
would eventually make air power a significant military force apart from its
early role of solely supporting ground troops. The appearance of the B-17 bomber
and the threat of global war ushered in an era of greater expenditure, manpower
expansion, and more specialized and more sophisticated training. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.7.2. The General Headquarters Air Force resumed the
practice of sending demonstration teams to fairs and expositions and expanded
the scope and scale of publicity flights to include large gestures such as
goodwill missions to South America. These expeditions also provided
opportunities to test the new long-range big bombers. In February 1938, the air
force flew six B-17s with full crews, including enlisted men, to Buenos Aires
to mark the inauguration of the new Argentine president. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.7.3 Even before the actual outbreak of hostilities in
Europe in the fall of 1939, the General Headquarters Air Force had begun the
massive expansion program that would blossom during the following years into
the largest air organization in the Nation’s history. In 1939, President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt asked for an appropriation of $300 million for
military aviation. The Air Corps planned for 24 operational combat-ready groups
by 1941, which called for greatly enhanced manpower, training, and equipment. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">1.8.
The Air Corps Prepares for War. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal32">In 1938, when the United States first took seriously the
signs of war in Europe, the army’s air arm was still split into two cumbersome
command organizations, the Army Air Corps and General Headquarters Air Force.
The total force included less than 20,000 enlisted Airmen. In 1940, Congress
passed the first peacetime conscription law in United States history. By March
1944 when the air force manpower reached their high point, 2,104,405 enlisted
men and women were serving in a virtually independent branch of the armed
services. Moreover, they operated a sophisticated machine of air war that covered
nearly the entire globe. </p>

<p class="msonormal33"><b class="calibre1">1.9.
Airpower in World War II: The European Theater: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.9.1. If the First World War signaled airpower’s promise,
the Second World War fulfilled the vision. In every aspect of aerial combat,
airpower served as a force multiplier and a vital component of the joint,
combined arms campaign. Air superiority proved a prerequisite for successful
land, sea, or air operations. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.9.2. On 1 September 1939, Adolf Hitler launched a massive
assault on Poland that opened the greatest war in history and spawned the term
Blitzkrieg, or “lightning war.” The German Air Force (<i class="calibre2">Luftwaffe</i>)
employed Messerschmitt Me109 fighters to gain air superiority; Heinkel He-111
and Dornier Do-17 twin-engined bombers to pound Poland’s capital, Warsaw; and
Junkers Ju-87 <i class="calibre2">Stuka</i> dive bombers to attack Polish ground forces and
terrorize refugees. Commanded by Hermann Göring, the <i class="calibre2">Luftwaffe</i>
emphasized speed and concentration of forces to crush the enemy. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.9.3. In April 1940, German forces surprised neutral
Denmark and Norway, where <i class="calibre2">Luftwaffe</i> aircraft inflicted significant
damage to Britain’s Royal Navy, protected inferior German naval forces, and
airlifted German troops to Norwegian airfields. In May, Hitler’s forces invaded
the Netherlands and Belgium. The speed of the German advance and the
ruthlessness of the bombing of Rotterdam shocked the West. German paratroopers
and glider forces surprised Belgium’s famed Eban Emael fortress, considered the
strongest in Europe. When German forces attacked France, the <i class="calibre2">Luftwaffe</i>
gained air superiority, masked the movement of German panzers through the
Ardennes forest, and hindered Allied attempts to rally. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.9.4. Following the defeat of France in June 1940, the
victorious <i class="calibre2">Luftwaffe</i> faced Britain’s Royal Air Force in the Battle of
Britain, the first all-air campaign in history. On paper, the <i class="calibre2">Luftwaffe</i>
appeared to have a decisive edge, with 1,232 medium bombers, 406 dive bombers,
813 single-engine fighters, 282 twin-engine fighters, and 50 long-range
reconnaissance aircraft manned by experienced crews. Opposing them, Air Marshal
Sir Hugh Dowding’s Fighter Command assembled 704 operational aircraft,
including roughly 400 Hawker Hurricanes, suited for attacking bombers, and 200
Supermarine Spitfires, a fighter equal to German Messerschmitts.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.9.5. Despite the apparent mismatch, the German Air Force
suffered from serious weaknesses. Substantial losses had eroded <i class="calibre2">Luftwaffe</i>
strength; in particular, the forces in France badly needed rest and refitting.
Equally significant, German training, equipment, and experience proved
ill-suited for a long-range strategic air campaign. Although the Me-109 was a
superb fighter, the short range limited the Me-109 combat time and tactical
flexibility over England. The long-range Me-110 proved hopelessly outclassed by
Royal Air Force Spitfires and Hurricanes. On the other hand, Dowding’s Fighter
Command had been preparing for a German onslaught since 1937. Using Sir Robert
Watson-Watt’s innovation, radar, the British created an effective, integrated
air defense system. Dowding also exploited a breakthrough in code breaking with
the use of the Enigma machine. Any information gained from Enigma was top
secret and known as ULTRA. This gave British intelligence forewarning of major
attacks and invaluable insight on the status of German maintenance and
logistics.  </p>

<p class="msonormal34">1.9.6. Plagued by poor intelligence, Göring and other <i class="calibre2">Luftwaffe</i>
leaders miscalculated, leading to a battle of attrition won by the Royal Air
Force. Failing to appreciate the value of British radar stations, the Germans
first attacked Royal Air Force airfields and then after the Royal Air Force
bombed Berlin 24 August,<span class="calibre25"> </span>switched
to a terror bombing campaign against London. Against German losses of 1,733
aircraft, the Royal Air Force lost 915 planes. By 15 September 1940, Hitler
abandoned his planned invasion of Britain. In tribute to the Royal Air Force
Fighter Command, Prime Minister Winston Churchill stated, “Never in the field
of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.” </p>

<p class="msonormal35"><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1143" src="image017.png" class="calibre26"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal36">1.9.7. The fall of
France in June 1940 galvanized President Franklin Roosevelt’s resolve to fight
Nazi tyranny. Knowing the isolationist sentiment of many Americans, Roosevelt
turned to airpower as a major weapon. The President called for American
industry to build 50,000 military aircraft. Considering that in 1939, the
United States Army Air Corps numbered roughly 1,800 aircraft and 18,000 men,
this figure stunned air leaders and industrialists alike. American industry
proved equal to the task, but aeronautical designs, blueprints, tools, dies,
air frames, and engines, not to mention factories, skilled workers, and the
countless other components of an aviation industry required time to develop.
Air logisticians such as Major General Oliver P. Echols began the most massive
aircraft procurement program in history. Until December 1940, the United States
built aircraft at a rate of only 800 per month. By 1942, American factories
produced 47,800 aircraft, and by 1944, an astronomical 96,300 planes. American
industrial production emerged as a key to Allied victory. </p>

<p class="msonormal36"> </p>

<p class="msonormal37">1.9.8. To manage growing American airpower, a major
reorganization created the United States Army Air Forces. General Henry “Hap” Arnold
was appointed Commanding General of the United States Army Air Forces and
Deputy Chief of Staff, Air Force to General George C. Marshall. In August 1941,
a group of ex-Air Corps Tactical School instructors created a doctrinal
blueprint, Air War Planning Document 1, for the conduct of a strategic air
campaign against the Axis. Led by Lieutenant Colonel Harold “Hal” George, Major
Lawrence Kuter, Major Kenneth Walker, and Captain Haywood “Possum” Hansell, the
team created the conceptual framework for the American air effort in World War
II. Reflecting 1930s Air Corps Tactical School doctrine of using massive force
to destroy the enemy’s will and capability to fight through long-range
strategic bombardment, Air War Planning Document 1 called for 239 combat
groups; 26,416 combat aircraft, including 7,500 heavy bombers; 37,051 training
planes; 150,000 trained aircrews; and 2.2 million personnel.  </p>

<p class="msonormal37"> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.9.9. On 7 December 1941, “a date which will live in
infamy,” Imperial Japan dealt a devastating blow to the United States Pacific
Fleet at Pearl Harbor. Two waves of 350 Japanese aircraft sank or heavily
damaged all eight United States battleships. Concerned over the prospect of
sabotage, the United States Army ground commander ordered United States Army
Air Forces aircraft parked in tight rows that made prime targets for Japanese
aviators. To make matters worse, a few hours later, Japanese forces caught
United States aircraft on the ground refueling in the Philippines and
destroyed  B-17s and assorted fighters. On 8 December, the United States
declared war on Japan; three days later, Germany and Italy were at war with the
United States as allies of Japan. Despite the fact the attack on Pearl Harbor
was what formally brought the United States into the war, the war in Europe and
the defeat of Germany would take precedence. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.9.10. As America entered the war, the Royal Air Force
tried to persuade the United States Army Air Forces to switch to night
operations, like those of Royal Air Force Bomber Command. Under Air Marshal Sir
Arthur Harris, Royal Air Force bombing doctrine embraced night area bombing of
German cities to displace German workers. To United States Army Air Forces
leaders, night bombing was ineffective, inefficient, and indiscriminate with
regard to civilian casualties. After tough negotiations, the Casablanca
Directive of January 1943 inaugurated the Combined Bomber Offensive, codenamed
Operation POINTBLANK, combining American precision daylight bombing and British
night area bombing.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.9.11. In February 1942, Brig Gen Ira C. Eaker established
the VIII Bomber Command, flying from bases in England in preparation for the
United States Army Air Forces buildup. General Spaatz assumed command of the
“Mighty Eighth” in June 1942. On 17 August 1942, a dozen B-17Es from the 97th
Bomb Group conducted the first American operational bombing mission. The strike
against a railroad marshalling yard in Rouen, France, barely penetrated the
German defenses, but the mission and a series of others known as the “Freshman
Raids” showed promise for American daylight bombardment. </p>

<p class="msonormal12"><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1142" src="image018.png" class="calibre27"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal12">1.9.12. Three
disastrous missions in the late summer and fall of 1943 illustrated United
States Army Air Forces theory flaws. Eager to strike Hitler’s oil supply, 177 B-24
Liberators based in North Africa attacked oil refineries at Ploesti, Romania,
on 1 August 1943. Ploesti was one of the most heavily defended targets in
Europe, so success depended on a 2,700-mile flight (much at low-level to avoid
radar detection), accurate open-water navigation, good weather, and surprise.
But a combination of bad weather, human error, and bad luck scattered the
bomber formations and resulted in a nightmare for surviving crews. As the
careful plan imploded, bombers improvised striking targets of opportunity in
the face of determined fighter opposition and hundreds of anti-aircraft guns.
The attacking force lost 54 B-24s; 41 in combat. Of the 177 aircraft, only 30
emerged unscathed. Although the strike reduced oil-refining capacity by 40
percent, within a few days a new facility opened, negating the damage.</p>

<p class="msonormal12"> </p>

<p class="msonormal37">1.9.13. After finally assembling enough trained crews to
strike deep into Germany, Eighth Air Force planners targeted German ball
bearing factories in an effort to destroy a “vital center” in the enemy’s
industrial web. They devised an ambitious double raid upon the Messerschmitt
aircraft factory at Regensburg and the top-priority Schweinfurt ball bearing
plants. The plan called for a wave of the 3d Air Division to fight through German
fighters, hit Regensburg, and proceed to North Africa to land, followed 30
minutes later by a second bomber wave that would strike Schweinfurt as German
fighters on the ground rearmed and refueled. </p>

<p class="msonormal37"> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.9.14. On 17 August 1943, General LeMay’s 3d Air Division
launched the first wave. Thick fog delayed the second wave and prevented
fighter escorts from taking off. When the fog lifted, almost the entire German
fighter force pounced upon the ill-fated 1st Air Division. The Eighth Air Force
staggered under the loss of 60 out of 361 B-17s and 600 trained aircrew
members, more casualties in a day than during the previous six months. To make
matters worse, the Schweinfurt ball bearing plants required reattack. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.9.15. Known as “Black Thursday,” the 14 October 1943
mission against Schweinfurt effectively ended the United States Army Air Forces
unescorted bombing campaign. Determined to destroy the top priority target,
General Eaker ordered 291 B-17s to run the gauntlet of German fighters. This
time, bombing accuracy improved significantly and the mission severely damaged
the factories, but another 60 bombers were shot down; seven were destroyed upon
landing in England, and 138 B-17s suffered battle damage. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.9.16. While warplanners devoted the bulk of American airpower
to daylight strategic bombing, in October 1943, heavily modified,
mission-unique bombers from the Special Flight Section, 5th Bombardment Wing,
Twelfth Air Force, along with England-based 801st Bombardment Group
“Carpetbaggers,” provided clandestine support for allied partisans and guerilla
units in occupied territories, rescuing hundreds of downed aircrews trapped
behind enemy lines. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.9.17. Some technological and production breakthroughs
reversed the course of the air war over the winter of 19431944. During the
initial campaigns, effective long-range escort fighters appeared to be
technically impossible. In order to carry the fuel necessary for long-range
flight, fighters required at least twin engines, but the increased size
sacrificed speed and maneuverability. The long-range Lockheed P-38 Lightning
offered a partial solution, but the P-38’s performance lagged at high
altitudes. In mid-1943, the United States Army Air Forces introduced 75-gallon,
and later 108-gallon, drop tanks that extended the combat radius of the
Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter from 175 miles to 280 miles and 325 miles,
respectively. The P-47’s extended range proved an important step, but only a
partial answer to the escort problem. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.9.18. The North American Aviation P-51 Mustang
revolutionized the air war over Europe. Designed in only 100 days during the
spring of 1940, the Mustang was to supplement the Royal Air Force’s Spitfire.
The initial Allison engine for the P-51 proved inadequate; but when the
Spitfire’s Rolls-Royce Merlin engine replaced the original power plant, the
results stunned aviators. At 440 mph, the P-51B was faster and could out turn
and out dive the latest models of Me-109 and the new Focke-Wulf FW-190. With a
basic range of 500 miles, augmentable to 850 miles, the Mustang flew farther
than a B-17 with normal payload. Introduced in December 1943, the P-51 had to
wait until late February 1944 before weather permitted full flight operations
and was a technological marvel: a plane with a bomber’s range and a fighter’s
performance. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.9.19. The P-47 and P-51 team seized the air superiority
from the <i class="calibre2">Luftwaffe</i> in the spring of 1944. Complementing the
technological improvements, Allied factories poured out large numbers of new
aircraft and stateside training bases produced well-trained air crews. At the
helm of the VIII Fighter Command, Brigadier General William E. Kepner maximized
his advantage by introducing new tactics. Fighters would no longer be required
to “stick to the bombers.” Numerical superiority permitted fighter sweeps and
aggressive scouting; superior range allowed fighters to strafe German airfields
and attack targets of opportunity. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.9.20. Armed with new aircraft, tactics,
and superior numbers, Spaatz, Doolittle, and Kepner launched Operation ARGUMENT
with the objective of winning air superiority and crippling Germany’s aircraft
industry. Between 20 and 25 February 1944, the 8th Air Force flew 3,300 heavy
bomber sorties; the Fifteenth Air Force added 500 missions from Italy; and
Royal Air Force Bomber Command flew 2,750 night attacks aimed at German
aircraft manufacturing plants. Protecting them involved nearly 4,000 fighter
sorties. At a cost of 226 American bombers, 114 British heavies, and 41 United
States Army Air Forces fighters, Operation ARGUMENT destroyed 355 <i class="calibre2">Luftwaffe</i>
fighters, damaged 155 fighters, and killed 400 fighter pilots. Although the <i class="calibre2">Luftwaffe</i>
replaced its aircraft, it could not replace the 2,262 experienced pilots killed
in the five months preceding D-Day, the invasion of Normandy. </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1141" src="image019.png" class="calibre28"/></span><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1140" src="image020.png" class="calibre29"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.9.21. By 6 June 1944, Allied air forces dominated the
skies of Europe. On the first day of the invasion, the Allies directed 8,722
United States Army Air Forces and 5,676 Royal Air Force sorties against German
defenses in France. In response, the once vaunted <i class="calibre2">Luftwaffe</i> could launch
fewer than 100 sorties and only two German aircraft inflicted damage on the
invasion beaches. Allied bombers and fighters trumped the German integrated air
defense network.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.9.22. After the Normandy invasion, the Combined Bomber
Offensive devastated Germany. Approximately 75 percent of the 1.5 million tons
of bombs dropped were after June 1944. In contrast to the horrific losses experienced
at Schweinfurt, Regensburg, and Ploesti in 1943, American losses fell to
“acceptable” rates. By 1945, some raids reported negligible losses: one bomber
lost out of 1,094 sent to Kassel, five out of 1,310 at ChemnitzMagdeburg, and
zero losses out of 1,219 at Nuremburg. At its peak, the United States Army Air
Forces and Royal Air Force massed 7,904 heavy bombers in the theater and 28,000
combat planes total. By 16 April 1945, General Spaatz declared the strategic
air war against Germany ended since all significant targets were considered
destroyed. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.9.23. From 1942 to 1945, the Combined Bomber Offensive was
the longest, bloodiest, air campaign in history. According to the United States
Strategic Bombing Survey, the Allies flew 1.69 million combat sorties and
dropped 1.5 million tons of bombs, killing and wounding more than a million
Germans, and destroying 3.6 million buildings: 20 percent of the nation’s
total. Airpower emerged as a dominant weapon in Western Europe during World War
II. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"> </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1139" src="image021.png" class="calibre30"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.9.24. Enlisted personnel served with honor
throughout World War II. For example, a raid against the last operational Nazi
oil refinery on 15 March 1945 was successful, but cost the life of one of the
enlisted force’s most decorated Airmen. Sergeant Sandy Sanchez flew 44 missions
as a gunner with the 95th Bomb Group, 19 more than required to complete his
tour. After returning home for a brief period, rather than accept an assignment
as a gunnery instructor, he returned to Europe. Flying with the 353d
Bombardment Squadron in Italy, Sanchez’s aircraft was hit by ground fire. Nine
of the 10-member crew bailed out successfully, but Sanchez never made it from
the stricken aircraft. Sanchez was the only enlisted airman to have a B-17
named for him. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.9.25. At the age of 20, on a mission to
bomb the oil refineries outside Vienna, Technical Sergeant Paul Airey and his
fellow crewmen were shot down on their 28th mission. He was held as a prisoner
of war for 10 months, surviving a 90-day march from the Baltic Sea to Berlin before
being liberated by the British Army in 1945. Promoted to Chief Master Sergeant
in 1962, Airey became the first Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force in 1967.
In 1988, he received the first Air Force prisoner of war medal. </p>

</p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">1.10.
The Tuskegee Airmen: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.10.1. In 1941, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt directed the Army Air Corps to accept black Americans into aviation
cadet training. The Air Corps, like all other components of the United States
Armed Forces, decided to segregate black aviators into all-black squadrons. By
the end of World War II, nearly a thousand black Americans had earned their
wings as Army flyers. Fired by a determination to prove their patriotism,
valor, and skill in combat, these black aviators, forever called the Tuskegee
Airmen, struck a significant blow against racism in America. </p>

<p class="msonormal8"> </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre5"><img id="_x0000_i1138" src="image022.jpg" class="calibre31"/></span><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1137" src="image023.png" class="calibre32"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.10.2. The first Tuskegee Airmen to fight
were members of the 99th Fighter Squadron, a unit commanded by black West Point
graduate and future Air Force general officer, Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.
On 27 January 1944, over Anzio, pilots from the 99th Fighter Squadron, flying
obsolete P-40s, downed nine superior Focke-Wulf 190s. As the 99th Fighter
Squadron continued scoring kills, the 332d Fighter Group, another unit manned
by Tuskegee Airmen, arrived in Italy with obsolete P-39 ground-attack fighters.
In the spring of 1944, these segregated units transitioned to P-47 Thunderbolts
and to P-51 Mustangs a month later, when they began flying bomber escort
missions.<span class="calibre25"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal38">1.10.3.<span class="calibre25"> </span>The 332d Fighter Group flew escort missions from 9
June 1944 until the German surrender in the spring of 1945. By a large margin,
the Tuskegee Airmen destroyed more aircraft than they lost. They shot down 111
enemy aircraft in air-to-air combat, losing 66 of their own aircraft to all
causes, including seven shot down. A tribute to their skill, courage, and
determination, the Tuskegee Airmen amassed a distinguished combat record on 200
escort missions into Germany. <span class="calibre25"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.10.4. While the 332d Fighter Group fought
in Europe, the segregated 477th Bomb Group, manned by Tuskegee Airmen, was
activated in 1944, at Selfridge Field, Michigan. Their ability to prepare for
war was hampered by frequent relocations and segregation-imposed training
barriers.<span class="calibre25"> </span>Nevertheless,
the Tuskegee Airmen struck a significant blow to the poison of racism in
America, fighting bigotry by their actions in the skies over North Africa, the
Mediterranean, Sicily, Italy, Austria, Yugoslavia, France, Romania, and
Germany. With their record, they dispelled myths, opened eyes, rewrote history,
and prepared the United States Air Force to be the first armed service to
integrate racially. </p>

<p class="msonormal39"><b class="calibre1">1.11.
Air War in the Pacific: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal8"><span class="calibre5"><img id="_x0000_i1136" src="image024.png" class="calibre33"/></span><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1135" src="image025.png" class="calibre34"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal8"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre7">         
Flying Tiger P-40</span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.11.1. America’s first combat experience in
the Pacific Theater of World War II occurred before the declaration of war. In
early 1941, former Air Corps Tactical School instructor Claire Lee Chennault
organized the American volunteer group, known as the “Flying Tigers,” to aid
Nationalist China against Japanese invaders. Famous for shark mouths painted on
their Curtis P-40 Warhawks, the Flying Tigers amassed an impressive 286
confirmed victories, losing only 12 pilots, before being disbanded in July
1942. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">1.11.2. The Japanese forces appeared
invincible during the first six months of conflict, and America needed a strong
offensive strike against the Japanese to boost sagging morale. On 18 April 1942,
Lieutenant Colonel James “Jimmy” Doolittle led 16 North American B-25 Mitchell
medium bombers, launching from the carrier USS <i class="calibre2">Hornet</i>, in a bombing raid
on various targets in Tokyo, Kobe, and Nagoya. The Doolittle Raid inflicted
little damage, but the gesture shocked Japanese military leaders and cheered
the American public. Upon his return to the United States in May 1942,
Doolittle received the Medal of Honor and promotion to brigadier general. 
</p>

<p class="msonormal40"> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.11.3. Not many fliers have had a popular song written
about them, but an exception was a soft-spoken United States Army Air Force
enlisted man, John D. Foley. Although he never received aerial gunnery
training, he volunteered as a gunner and was assigned to a B-26 crew. On his
first mission, Foley shot down at least one Japanese enemy aircraft. Other 19th
Bomb Squadron members confirmed his victory and he was nicknamed “Johnny Zero”
by a war correspondent. Corporal Foley became a hero and the subject of a
popular song, “Johnny Got a Zero.” Commercial firms capitalized on his fame and
produced such items as “Johnny Zero” watches and boots. During his 31 other
Pacific combat missions, Foley shared in the destruction of at least six more
enemy aircraft and survived three crashes. Malaria forced his return to the
United States in 1943 where he toured factories promoting war production. He
volunteered to fly again and completed 31 missions over Europe. He returned to
the United States again and was preparing for a third overseas tour when World
War II ended. But before the war ended, Foley became an Army Air Force legend
by being decorated a total of eight times for heroism including personal
recognition by Generals MacArthur, Eisenhower, and Doolittle.<b class="calibre1"> </b> </p>

<p class="msonormal37">1.11.4. Naval aviation played a vital role in the Pacific War.
Under the leadership of Admirals Chester Nimitz, Frank “Jack” Fletcher, Raymond
Spruance, and William “Bull” Halsey, United States carrier-based aviation
proved the value of airpower at sea. The Battle of Coral Sea, fought 4-8 May
1942, marked the first naval battle fought entirely by air. At the Battle of
Midway, 4 June 1942, United States Navy pilots sank four Japanese carriers and
turned the tide of the war in the Pacific. </p>

<p class="msonormal37"> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.11.5. The primary United States Army Air Forces
contribution to the Pacific counterattack was made by the Fifth Air Force,
attached to the Southwest Pacific Theater under General Douglas MacArthur’s
command. While Admiral Nimitz’ carrier task forces struck from the Central
Pacific, MacArthur’s command thrust across New Guinea toward the Philippines.
Because of the “Europe First” strategy, Fifth Air Force flew second string
aircraft out of primitive bases, struggling to overcome its low resource
priority level and a 10,000 mile supply chain. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.11.6. In July 1942, Major General George C. Kenney assumed
command of the Fifth Air Force. Kenney maximized the resource-poor command’s
combat power. In a theater where range dominated employment decisions, Kenney
used the Lockheed P-38 Lightning with locally developed 150-gallon drop tanks.
Kenney encouraged an ingenious subordinate, Maj Paul “Pappy” Gunn, to mount
quad .50-caliber machine guns in the nose of A-20 and B-25 aircraft, creating
deadly attack planes. Other Fifth Air Force innovations included parachutes
attached to fragmentation bombs and low-level “skip” bombing techniques. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.11.7. An even lower a priority than Fifth Air Force,
Allied forces in the China-Burma-India Theater faced logistical challenges at
the end of the war’s longest supply chain. Called to transport vital supplies
across the Himalayas, Air Transport Command crews, flying C-46s and C-47s,
braved perilous weather conditions to deliver 650,000 tons of supplies to
Chinese and American forces. Flying the “Hump” was one of the most hazardous
military air operations of World War II. Enterprise architect William H. Tunner
developed many maintenance and cargo-handling techniques that later proved
invaluable during the Berlin Airlift. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.11.8. In addition to Air Transport Command efforts in the
China-Burma-India Theater, the 1st Air Commando Group, led by Lieutenant
Colonel Phillip G. Cochran and John R. Allison, provided assistance to British
“Chindit” forces conducting long-range penetration missions against the
Japanese during Operation Thursday, using unconventional air warfare to support
British ground forces. America’s first Air Commandos demonstrated that air
power could support unconventional warfare any place, any time. The 1st Air
Commando Group also demonstrated its ingenuity, conducting the first helicopter
combat rescue.  </p>

<p class="msonormal12"><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1134" src="image026.png" class="calibre35"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal12">1.11.9. Allied
soldiers, sailors, and marines pushed back the borders of the Japanese empire
and airmen sought to destroy Japan through strategic bombardment. General
Arnold hoped to clinch victory through airpower alone in order to avoid a costly
land invasion. In November 1939, Air Corps leaders selected the primary
campaign instrument: the Boeing XB-29. With a pressurized crew compartment,
remotely controlled guns, and new radial engines, the B-29 was an aircraft of
unprecedented size and capability. The United States Army Air Forces ordered
1,664 before the prototype had even flown. The rush to produce the plane led to
substantial technical problems. Nevertheless, by April 1944, B-29s appeared in
the China-Burma-India to conduct Operation MATTERHORN, the designation for B-29
operations out of bases in India and China to carry out strategic bombing of
Japanese force. </p>

<p class="msonormal12"> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.11.10. At first, XX Bomber Command crews attempted to
reproduce high-altitude daylight precision bombing, with disappointing results.
Flying from bases in China with logistical staging from India, XX Bomber
Command engine problems were amplified by distance and weather. By October
1944, B-29 operations shifted to Saipan, significantly reducing supply lines.
Former Air Corps Tactical School instructor Haywood S. Hansell renewed efforts
for a daylight precision bombing campaign. Impatient with the results, General
Arnold replaced Hansell in January 1945 with Major General Curtis E. LeMay, a
proven combat commander from the European theater. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.11.11. LeMay drastically altered B-29 tactics. To avoid
the jet stream and high-altitude engine problems, LeMay ordered low-altitude
night attacks with bombers stripped of defensive machine guns, reduced fuel
loads, and increased bomb loads. Much like the Royal Air Force, LeMay’s B-29s
relied on darkness for protection and pummeled enemy cities with incendiary
bombs. From March-August 1945, American firebomb raids destroyed 66 Japanese
cities and burned 178 square miles of urban landscape. Civilian casualties were
severe; in one raid against Tokyo an estimated 80,000 people perished. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">1.11.12. Following a successful atomic test on 18 July 1945,
the Allied powers issued an ultimatum on 26 July calling for the Japanese
government to surrender or suffer “prompt and utter destruction.” Specially
modified B-29s from the 393d Bombardment Squadron, a component of the 509th
Composite Group, delivered the first operational atomic bombs. On 6 August
1945, Colonel Paul Tibbets piloted the Enola Gay which dropped a uranium bomb,
known as </p>

<p class="msonormal10">“Little Boy,” over Hiroshima destroying nearly five square
miles of the city and killing 80,000 people. Japan did not surrender. On 9
August 1945, the B-29 Bockscar, commanded by Major Charles W. Sweeney, released
a plutonium bomb called “Fat Man” on Nagasaki. Because Nagasaki was partially
protected by hilly terrain, the bomb devastated 1.5 square miles, killed
35,000, and injured 60,000. Faced with a defeated army, destroyed navy and air
force, burned cities, a declaration of war by the Soviet Union, and atomic
weapons, the Japanese government surrendered 14 August 1945. In the Pacific
Theater, airpower proved even more decisive than in Europe. The industrial
might of the United States overwhelmed Japanese forces. The geographic
circumstances and immense distances involved made airpower the preeminent
weapon. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">1.12.
Air Force Independence and the Cold War: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.12.1. With victory in World War II, the American public
returned to normal life. Airpower and military affairs, in general, decreased
in importance. From a wartime strength of more than 79,000 aircraft and 2.4
million people, forces dwindled to 24,000 aircraft and 304,000 people by May
1947. Nevertheless, airpower’s impact on warfare led to the realization of
Billy Mitchell’s dream. On 26 July 1947, President Harry S. Truman signed into
law the National Security Act of 1947, which provided for a separate Department
of the Air Force. On 18 September 1947, Stuart Symington became the first
Secretary of the Air Force and officially established the United States Air
Force as an independent, coequal service. Under the leadership of General
Spaatz as the first Chief of Staff, Air Force and that of his successor,
General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, the Air Force clarified roles and missions and
organized to meet the challenges of the growing Cold War. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.12.2. In many areas, the establishment of the Air Force
had little impact on the lives of most Airmen until months or even years had
passed. What were designated as “organic” service units were taken over as
newly designated Air Force units. Units that provided a common service to both
the Army and the Air Force were left intact. Until 1950, for example, if an
Airman became seriously ill, he was likely treated by Army doctors in an Army
hospital. There was also, at first, no change in appearance. The distinctive
blue uniforms of the United States Air Force were introduced only after large
stocks of Army clothing were used up. Familiar terms slowly gave way to new
labels. By 1959, enlisted Airmen ate in “dining halls” rather than “mess
halls,” were eyed warily by “air police” instead of “military police,” and
bought necessities at the “base exchange” instead of the “post exchange.” </p>

<p class="msonormal4">1.12.3. Initially, the enlisted rank
system remained as it had been in the United States Army Air Force. Corporal
was removed from NCO status in 1950. Then, in 1952, the Air Force officially
changed the names of the lower four ranks from private to Airman basic; private
first class to Airman, third class; corporal to Airman, second class; and
sergeant to Airman, first class. These changes were in response to a
development that surfaced during World War II, and the rank structure would
continue to evolve over time. Promotion and specialization went hand-in-hand
with training in the new Air Force. When the new organization established Air
Force specialty codes as standard designations for functional and technical
specialties, qualification for an advanced Air Force specialty code became part
of the criteria for promotion. During the late 1940s, the Air Force also began
an Airman Career Program that attempted to encourage long term careers for
enlisted specialists.  </p>

<p class="msonormal4"> </p>

<p class="msonormal12">1.12.4. The Berlin
Crisis awakened Americans to the impact of the Cold War between the United
States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. On 24 June 1948, the
Soviets blockaded railroad and road corridors serving the 2.5 million residents
of West Berlin, deep within Communist East Germany. United States Air Forces in
Europe Commander General LeMay organized a makeshift airlift of food, medicine,
and coal. United States Air Forces in Europe C-47 and C-54 cargo aircraft
established a precise schedule of flights every three minutes, 24-hours-a-day.
After the first month, Major General William H. Tunner assumed command of an
expanded effort that would include 300 American and 100 British aircraft flown
by aircrews who would apply lessons learned while flying the “Hump” during
World War II. On 15 April 1949, 1,398 aircraft delivered a one-day record
12,941 tons of supplies. By 1949, the Soviets acknowledged the airlift’s
success and lifted the blockade. Operation VITTLES tallied </p>

<p class="msonormal6">277,804 flights delivering 2.3 million tons
of supplies. This nonviolent use of airpower<b class="calibre1"> </b>defused a potentially
disastrous confrontation. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre5"><img id="_x0000_i1131" src="image029.png" class="calibre38"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre7">             
Berlin airlift</span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.12.5. Throughout the airlift, enlisted personnel served as
cargo managers and loaders (with a major assist from German civilians), air
traffic controllers, communications specialists, and weather and navigation
specialists. Of all the enlisted functions, perhaps the most critical to the
success of the airlift was maintenance. The Soviets’ eventual capitulation and
dismantling of the surface blockade represented one of the great Western
victories of the cold war—without a bomb having been dropped—and laid the
foundation for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.12.6. The 1948 Berlin Crisis and 1949 Soviet detonation of
an atomic device motivated the Air Force to improve war readiness. As the new
Strategic Air Command commander, General LeMay emphasized rigorous training,
exacting performance standards, and immediate readiness. In the late 1940s, SAC
incorporated the B-50 (a more powerful version of the B-29) and the massive
Convair B-36 Peacemaker (the first bomber with intercontinental range) into the
inventory. Behind the scenes, the Air Force conducted a highly secret,
extensive electronic reconnaissance program that included covert flights over
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic to assess Communist air defenses.  </p>

<p class="msonormal43">1.12.7. Jet aircraft technological breakthroughs changed the
face of aviation. Although the Bell XP-59 Airacomet first flew 1 October 1942,
the Lockheed P-80 (later redesignated F-80) entered service in December 1945 as
the Air Force’s first operational jet fighter. On 14 October 1947, Charles
“Chuck” Yeager seized headlines as the first man to break the sound barrier.
His Bell X-1 “Glamorous </p>

<p class="msonormal44">Glennis” reached Mach 1.06 at 43,000 feet after a launch
from a B-29 mother ship. In the early 1950s, Strategic Air Command upgraded to
an all-jet bomber force, activating the Boeing B-47 Stratojet and the Boeing
B-52 Stratofortress. </p>

<p class="msonormal45"><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1130" src="image030.png" class="calibre39"/></span><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1129" src="image031.png" class="calibre40"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal45"> </p>

<p class="msonormal45">1.12.8. On 25 June 1950, Communist North Korea
launched a massive invasion of <b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre7">X-1 and the B-29</span> </b>United States-backed South Korea. Three days
later, American B-26 bombers </p>

<p class="msonormal4">attacked advancing North Korean troops
in the first major flare-up of the Cold War. For six weeks, Far East Air
Forces, commanded by Lieutenant General George E. Stratemeyer, gained air
superiority to help United Nations forces shut down the North Korean assault.
The initial phase of the Korean War illustrated the dangers of being
unprepared, as American Airmen struggled to relearn close air support and
interdiction skills. In addition, the F-80’s limited range inhibited the time
over target required for tactical operations. About 100 Far East Air Forces
Bomber Command B-29s conducted strategic operations to destroy the enemy’s will
and capacity to fight. Although United Nations forces controlled the skies and
destroyed North Korea’s industrial base, multiple limitations frustrated hopes
of decisive victory. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"> </p>

<p class="msonormal12">1.12.9. General
MacArthur’s amphibious assault at Inchon and successive operations shattered
the North Korean Army, but the United Nations advance into North Korea led to
Communist Chinese intervention. The entry of half a million Chinese troops in
November 1950 drastically changed the war. Within weeks, advanced Soviet-made
MiG-15 fighters appeared. Flown by North Korean, Chinese, and Soviet pilots,
the MiG-15 outperformed American F-51, F-80, and F-84 aircraft. Lieutenant
Russell Brown, flying an F-80C, shot down a MiG-15 in the world’s first all-jet
air battle on 8 November 1950. In response to the enemy’s superior speed and
altitude, Air Force leaders rushed the North American F-86 Sabre into action.
The F-86 matched the MiG’s speed and proved a more stable gun platform. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1128" src="image032.png" class="calibre41"/></span><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1127" src="image033.png" class="calibre42"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal10"> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.12.10. On 9 November 1950, Corporal Harry LaVene of the
91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, serving as gunner, scored the first
B-29 victory over a jet by downing a MiG-15. LaVene’s victory was the first of
27 MiGs shot down by B-29 gunners during the course of the war. Sergeant Billie
Beach, a tail gunner on an Okinawa-based B-29, shot down two MiGs on 12 April
1951, a feat unmatched by any other gunner. His own plane was so shot up,
however, that it and the crew barely survived an emergency landing with
collapsed gear at an advanced fighter strip.  </p>

<p class="msonormal37">1.12.11. As the war on the ground settled into stalemate,
F-86s battled over “MiG </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Alley,” where superior training and experience prevailed.
F-86 pilots destroyed 792 MiGs and 18 other enemy aircraft at a cost of 76
Sabres lost to MiGs, and 142 to other causes.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.12.12. During the Korean War, the Air Rescue Service
medically evacuated more than 9,600 wounded soldiers, and rescued nearly 1,000
personnel shot down over enemy territory. In addition, Air Resupply and
Communication Service wings executed unconventional warfare and
counterinsurgency operations against enemy forces. </p>

<p class="msonormal46">1.12.13. During the Korean War, a new
group of Air Force pilots entered the pantheon of fighter aces. The F-86 pilots
established a remarkable 10-to-1 kill ratio. Captain Joseph McConnell, a B-24
navigator in World War II, led the pack with a score of 16, closely followed by
Captain James Jabara who tallied 15 kills. Jabara gained recognition as the world’s
first jet ace. Unlike the mass squadron formations often flown in World War II,
Korean War pilots devised new tactics based on flights of only four F-86s. </p>

<p class="msonormal46"> </p>

<p class="msonormal12">1.12.14. Despite
success in the air war, the Korean War frustrated American airpower. Accustomed
to the commitment of World War II, Korean War era leaders struggled under
political, technological, and resource limitations inherent in the Cold War.
Worried that the conflict in Korea foreshadowed a Soviet invasion of Europe,
American policy makers limited operations in Asia in order to build up North
Atlantic Treaty Organization forces. Nevertheless, United Nations forces
repelled two communist invasions of South Korea, and American airpower secured
the skies against enemy air attack. </p>

<p class="msonormal12"> </p>

<p class="msonormal47">1.12.15. After the Korean conflict, Air Force missile and
space capabilities developed rapidly. In late 1953, Assistant Secretary of the
Air Force for Research and Development, Trevor Gardner, convened a group of
experts known as the </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Teapot Committee to examine the field of long-range
missiles. The committee’s 10 February 1954 report recommended accelerating
intercontinental ballistic missile development. Based on the recommendation,
the Air Research and Development Command, on 1 July 1954, established the
Western Development Division in Inglewood, California, to develop and field
intercontinental ballistic missiles. On 2 August 1954, Brigadier General
Bernard Schriever assumed command of the new organization. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.12.16. Concurrent with efforts to develop long-range missiles,
the United States also pursued space-based technology that could provide
accurate information on Soviet military intentions. On 27 November 1954, Air
Force senior leaders followed the recommendation of the RAND Corporation’s
Project Feed Back report, issuing Weapon System Requirement No. 5, directing
development of an electro-optical reconnaissance satellite. Weapon System
Requirement No. 5 later became weapon system 117L. The scope of weapon system
117L eventually broadened to include other space-based missions, such as
meteorology, missile warning, and multispectral imaging.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.12.17. On 4 October 1957, the course of missile and
satellite development changed when the Soviet Union successfully launched the
Sputnik I satellite into earth orbit. The Soviet success marked the beginning
of the space age and sparked the space race between the United States and
Soviet Union. Over the next two decades the Air Force played a major role in
the developing national space programs, assuming the mantle of America’s air
and space force. In response to the Sputnik I launch, President Eisenhower
accelerated United States civil and military space efforts; a decision that
would prove crucial throughout the Cold War. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.12.18. In 1958, the Air Force developed plans for a manned
military presence in space, but President Eisenhower reserved manned missions
for the National Aeronautics and Space Agency. However, the Air Force’s plan
formed the basis of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo Programs. The Atlas rocket,
which began as a United States Army Air Corps ballistic missile in October
1945, was used to launch the MERCURY missions. The Titan-II booster, also
originally a ballistic missile, launched the Gemini astronauts. In fact, the
Air Force and its contractors planned, built, and launched all of the Titan-II
rockets in Project Gemini. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre5"><img id="_x0000_i1126" src="image034.png" class="calibre43"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal10"><b class="calibre1"><sup class="calibre44"><span class="calibre45">Atlas
rocket launching</span></sup></b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.12.19. In 1960, the National Reconnaissance Office was
formed to take charge of highly classified reconnaissance satellites. President
Eisenhower undertook several initiatives to help prevent a surprise nuclear
attack against the United States, including establishing the classified Corona
satellite photo reconnaissance program. This system, known publicly as the
Discoverer research program, achieved its first successful launch of the
Discoverer XIII, 10 August 1960. Corona employed a payload capsule that
jettisoned from the orbiter, returned to earth by parachute, and was captured
by an aircraft. Discoverer XIV, launched a week after recovering Discoverer
XIII, shot over 3,000 feet of reconnaissance film from space, heralding the
beginning of America’s space-based photo reconnaissance capability. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.12.20. The Air Force concentrated on unmanned missions to
fulfill national security needs. Space reconnaissance satellites, for instance,
supported strategic deterrence throughout the Cold War, providing invaluable
knowledge of the Soviet Union’s nuclear inventory, and verifying arms control
treaty compliance. Space systems also provided early warning of any missile
attack on North America, and worldwide communications platforms for strategic
command and control. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">1.13.
Cuban Missile Crisis (1962): </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.13.1. In 1959, Fidel Castro overthrew the dictator of
Cuba, initially promising free elections, but instead he instituted a socialist
dictatorship. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans fled their island, many coming to
the United States. In late 1960, President Eisenhower authorized the Central
Intelligence Agency to plan an invasion of Cuba using Cuban exiles as troops.
President Eisenhower hoped that, in conjunction with the invasion, the Cuban
people would overthrow Castro and install a pro-United States government. The
President’s second term ended before the plan could be implemented. President
John F. Kennedy ordered the invasion to proceed. In mid-April 1961, the Cuban
exiles landed at the Bay of Pigs and suffered a crushing defeat. </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1125" src="image035.png" class="calibre46"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.13.2. Following the failure of the United
States-supported Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by Cuban exiles in April 1961,
the Soviet Union increased economic and military aid to Cuba. In August 1962,
the Soviets and Cubans started constructing intermediate- and medium-range
ballistic missile complexes on the island. Suspicious, the United States intelligence
community called for photographic investigation and verification of the
activity. In October, Strategic Air Command U-2 aircraft deployed to McCoy Air
Force Base, Florida, and began flying high-altitude reconnaissance flights over
Cuba. On 15 October, photographs obtained on flights the previous day confirmed
the construction of launch pads that, when completed, could be used to employ
nuclear-armed missiles with a range up to 5,000 miles. Eleven days later,
RF101s and RB-66s began conducting low-level reconnaissance flights, verifying
data gathered by the U-2s and gathering prestrike intelligence.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.13.3. In the event an invasion of Cuba became necessary,
Tactical Air Command deployed F-84, F-100, F-105, RB-66, and KB-50 aircraft to
numerous bases in Florida. Meanwhile, Strategic Air Command prepared for
general war by dispersing nuclear-capable B-47 aircraft to approximately 40
airfields in the United States and keeping numerous B-52 heavy bombers in the
air ready to strike. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.13.4. Meanwhile, President Kennedy and his advisors on the
national security team debated the most effective course of action. Many on the
Joint Chiefs of Staff favored invasion, but President Kennedy took the somewhat
less drastic step of imposing a naval blockade of the island, which was
designed to prevent any more materiel from reaching Cuba. Still technically an
act of war, the blockade nevertheless had the advantage of not turning the cold
war into a hot one. </p>

<p class="msonormal48">1.13.5. Confronted with the photographic evidence of missiles,
the Soviet Union initially responded belligerently. Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev accused the United States of degenerate imperialism and declared
that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic would not observe the illegal
blockade. In the ensuing days, Khrushchev softened, and then hardened, his
position and demands. Tensions increased on 27 October when Cuban air defenses
shot down a U-2 piloted by Major Rudolf Anderson. </p>

<p class="msonormal48">1.13.6. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended an immediate
air strike against Cuba, but President Kennedy decided to wait. The increasing
tempo in the military, however, continued unabated. While United States
military preparations continued, the United States agreed not to invade Cuba in
exchange for removal of Soviet missiles from the island. Secretly, the United
States also agreed to remove American missiles from Turkey. The Soviets turned
their Cuban-bound ships around, packed up the missiles in Cuba, and dismantled
the launch pads. As the work progressed, the Air Force started to deploy
aircraft back to home bases and lower the alert status. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.13.7. The Cuban Missile Crisis brought the
United States and the Soviet Union dangerously close to nuclear war; the world
breathed a sigh of relief when it ended. The strategic and tactical power of
the United States Air Force, coupled with the will and ability to use it,
provided the synergy to deter nuclear war with the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republic and convince the Soviet leaders to remove the nuclear weapons from
Cuba. <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 1E—Vietnam, Desert Storm and Operations (1992-2014)</i></b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">1.14.
Vietnam, 1961-1973: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.14.1. After eight years, during which the Air Force worked
to build America’s strategic nuclear forces, President Kennedy’s administration
faced national wars of liberation backed by the Soviet Union. Responding to
Communist efforts in Laos and South Vietnam, President Kennedy in April 1961
ordered Operation FARMGATE; the covert deployment of the 4400th Combat Crew
Training Squadron (Jungle Jim) to train the South Vietnamese Air Force. Flying
North American T-28 Trojans, Douglas A-26 Invaders, and Douglas A-1E
Skyraiders, American pilots launched attack missions under the umbrella of
combat training. Following the August 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, when North
Vietnamese torpedo boats attacked the USS <i class="calibre2">Maddox</i>, President Lyndon B.
Johnson lifted the shroud of secrecy and ordered an orchestrated air attack as
a show of force. By December 1964, North American F-100 Super Sabres, McDonnell
RF-101 Voodoos, and Republic F-105 Thunderchiefs, with Boeing KC-135
Stratotanker support, conducted Operation BARRELL ROLL, attacking Communist
forces in Laos.</p>

<p class="msonormal10"> <span class="calibre5"><img id="_x0000_i1124" src="image036.png" class="calibre47"/></span><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1123" src="image037.png" class="calibre48"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.14.2. Faced with a deteriorating political
and military situation in South Vietnam, President Johnson ordered Operation
ROLLING THUNDER; a sign of American support to South Vietnam and a signal of
United States resolve. Beginning on 2 March 1965, Rolling Thunder was “a
program of measured and limited air action against selected military targets in
North Vietnam remaining south of the 19th Parallel.” Closely managed by the
White House, Rolling Thunder sought to apply incrementally announced military
power to undermine the North Vietnamese will to wage war. However, the United
States underestimated the enemy’s resiliency and determination. Air Force
leaders chafed at rules of engagement that negated the speed, surprise, and
flexibility of massed airpower. They believed periodic bombing pauses intended
to signal American intentions allowed the enemy to recover. In 1965, North
Vietnamese air defenses multiplied, including Soviet-made SA-2 surface-to-air
missiles. Hanoi established an advanced radar-controlled air defense system
that combined surface-to-air missiles, antiaircraft artillery, and
Sovietproduced MiG-17 and MiG-21 interceptors. Consequently, United States
losses mounted without any visible effect from the air campaign. By the fall of
1968, Air Force tactical aircraft had flown 166,000 sorties over North Vietnam,
and Navy attack aircraft added 144,500. In the process, the enemy downed 526
Air Force aircraft: surface-to-air missiles accounted for 54, MiGs destroyed
42, and antiaircraft artillery claimed the remainder. Personnel losses were
equally heavy. Of the 745 Air Force crew members shot down over North Vietnam,
145 were rescued, 255 were confirmed killed, 222 were captured, and 123 were
classified missing in action. Air Force leaders found these results intolerable
for an air campaign with virtually complete air superiority. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.14.3. Complementing operations over North Vietnam, the air
war over South Vietnam demonstrated the full spectrum of airpower. Air Force
aircraft and helicopters provided close air support, interdiction, reconnaissance,
airlift, tanker support, and search-and-rescue capabilities. Air Force
resources ranged from one-man Cessna O-1 Bird Dogs, used by forward air
controllers to mark enemy targets for strikers, to mammoth B-52Ds modified to
drop as many as 27 750pound bombs, and 84 500-pound bombs for Operation ARC
LIGHT interdiction missions. Vintage World War II aircraft, like AC-47 Puff the
Magic Dragon gunships, joined state-of-the-art platforms like the General
Dynamics swingwing, advanced terrain-following radar F-111 Aardvark. </p>

<p class="msonormal37">1.14.4. The January 1968 siege of Khe Sanh displayed the
potential of Air Force close air support. When more than </p>

<p class="msonormal10">20,000 North Vietnamese troops, protected by hilly, covered
terrain, surrounded 6,000 United States Marines, General William Momyer applied
massive firepower during Operation NIAGARA. A flight of three B-52s hit the
enemy every 90 minutes for most of the 77-day siege. To prevent the enemy from
overrunning the base, American aircraft dropped 100,000 tons of bombs, two-thirds
of those from B-52s. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.14.5. Following the 1968 bombing halt, President Richard
M. Nixon initiated a phased withdrawal from the frustrating conflict. From
536,000 United States troops in 1968, American personnel numbered fewer than 100,000
by 1972. When the North Vietnamese launched the Easter Offensive in Spring
1972, Nixon resolved to achieve peace with honor. Reinforcing ground troops was
politically impossible, so Nixon employed Operation LINEBACKER to blunt the
Communist attack. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.14.6. Unlike Rolling Thunder, military leaders were
allowed to use appropriate strategy and tactics, in part because the
administration significantly reduced restrictions. With the acquisition of
precision-guided munitions, new television and laser-guided smart bombs
dramatically increased strike accuracy. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.14.7. On 13 May 1972, 16 McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantoms
hit the Than Hoa bridge with 24 smart bombs, destroying a target that had
eluded American Airmen for years. From April to October 1972, Air Force and
Navy aircraft dropped 155,548 tons of bombs on North Vietnamese troops. The
era’s first war aces earned their marks during Linebacker, as well. On 28
August 1972, Captain Steve Ritchie shot down his fifth MiG- 21. Within weeks,
two F-4 weapons systems officers joined the fraternity of aces: Captain Charles
De Bellevue with six kills and Captain Jeffrey Feinstein with five. When North
Vietnamese negotiators accepted specific peace conditions, President Nixon
terminated the air campaign. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.14.8. In December 1972, North Vietnamese intransigence
over the final peace agreement prompted President Nixon to initiate Linebacker
II, an intense 11-day air campaign to pressure enemy compliance. From 18-29
December, American aircraft pounded military and industrial targets in North
Vietnam. For the first time, the White House authorized B-52 strikes near
Hanoi. In less than two weeks, 729 B-52 sorties dropped 15,000 tons of bombs
and fighter-bombers added another 5,000 tons. Despite the loss of 26 aircraft,
including 15 B-52s, airpower broke the impasse. Peace talks resumed 8 January
1973, and a comprehensive ceasefire was signed 23 January. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.14.9. During Vietnam, airpower demonstrated its
versatility and wide ranging impact, as well as its limitations. Despite an
impressive military showing, the United States did not win decisively in
Vietnam. Although the Air Force flew more than five million sorties and dropped
six million tons of bombs, North Vietnamese forces eventually conquered South
Vietnam in April 1975. Airpower did not prevent the collapse of the South
Vietnamese government or the change in American political climate. </p>

Duane Hackney</span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal10"> </p>

<p class="msonormal4">1.14.10. The Vietnam War saw a number
of notable and heroic achievements by Air Force enlisted members, including two
winners of the Medal of Honor, who will be discussed in detail in a later
section of this chapter. While not a Medal of Honor recipient, Duane Hackney
became one of the most honored heroes of the Vietnam War, the recipient of 28
decorations for valor in combat (more than 70 awards and decorations in all),
and winner of the Cheney Award for 1967, an honor presented for valor or
self-sacrifice in a humanitarian effort. Hackney enlisted in the Air Force a
few days after graduation, volunteering for pararescue training. An honor
graduate in every phase of the tough, year-long course, he had his choice of
assignments. Airman Second Class Hackney turned down assignments in Bermuda and
England for Detachment 7, 38th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron, at Da
Nang. Hackney flew more than 200 combat missions in three and a half years of
Vietnam duty, all as a volunteer. He earned four Distinguished Flying Crosses
for specific acts of heroism and 18 Air Medals, many for single acts of valor.
He also received the Air Force Cross, the Silver Star, the Airman's Medal, the
Purple Heart, and several foreign decorations. Hackney's most celebrated
mission was on 6 February 1967. That morning he descended from a HH-3E Jolly
Green Giant to look for a downed pilot near Mu Gia pass. The pilot had stopped
his radio transmissions, a clue that enemy troops were nearby. For two hours,
Hackney searched for the man, dodging enemy patrols, until the mission was
called off because of weather. Late that afternoon, the downed pilot came back
on the air, and Hackney's crew headed for the rescue area to get him out before
dark. This time Hackney found his man, badly injured but alive, got him onto
the forest penetrator, and started up to the chopper, drawing small-arms fire
all the way. As the men were hauled aboard, the helicopter took a direct hit
from a 37-mm antiaircraft gun and burst into flame. Wounded by shell fragments
and suffering third-degree burns, Hackney, knowing that the HH-3 was not going
to make it, put his own parachute on the rescued pilot and got him out of the
doomed chopper. Groping through dense smoke, he found an oil-soaked chute and
slipped it on. Before he could buckle the chute, a second 37-mm shell hit the
HH-3, blowing him out the door. He did not remember pulling the ripcord of the
unbuckled chute before hitting trees 250 feet below, then plunging 80 feet to a
rock ledge in a crevasse. When he regained consciousness, enemy troops were
leaping across the crevasse a few feet above him Once they were gone, Hackney
popped his smoke and was picked up by the backup chopper. There were no other
survivors from the rescue helicopter. For that mission, Hackney received the
Air Force Cross. In 1973, Hackney left the Air Force, one of the most decorated
pararescuemen of the Vietnam War. Four years later, missing the camaraderie of
Air Force life, he enlisted again, returning to duty as a pararescue
instructor. In 1981, he suffered a severe heart attack, the result of a rescue
operation, and was permanently grounded. Altogether, he served in the United
States Air Force from 1965 to 1991, retiring as a Chief Master Sergeant. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"> </p>

<p class="msonormal4">1.14.11. In December 1972, B-52 tail
gunner Staff Sergeant Samuel Turner shot down an enemy MiG, the first of only
two confirmed shootdowns by enlisted Airmen during the war—both victories from
gunners belonging to the 307th </p>

<p class="msonormal49">Strategic Wing at U-Tapao, Thailand.
Credit for the fifth overall MiG-21 kill during Linebacker II also went to an
enlisted Airman, Airman First Class Albert E. Moore. </p>

<p class="msonormal50">1.14.12. Chief Master Sergeant Wayne Fisk
was directly involved in the famed Son Tay prisoner of war camp raid and the
rescue of the crew of the USS <i class="calibre2">Mayaquez. </i>When the USS<i class="calibre2"> Mayaquez</i> was
highjacked by Cambodian Communist forces in May 1975, Fisk was a member of the assault
force that successfully recovered the ship, the crew, and the entrapped United
States Marines. For his actions, Fisk was presented with his second Silver
Star. Concluding the <i class="calibre2">Mayaquez</i> mission, he was recognized as the last
American serviceman to engage Communist forces in ground combat in Southeast
Asia. In 1979, he was the first Air Force enlisted recipient of the United
States Jaycees Ten Outstanding Young Men of America. In 1986, Fisk became the
first director of the Air Force Enlisted Heritage Hall on Maxwell Air Force
Base-Gunter Annex. </p>

<p class="msonormal51"><b class="calibre1">1.15. The Post-Vietnam Era and the end of the Cold War:</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal52">1.15.1. Rebuilding the conventional Air Force after Vietnam
began with personnel changes. The Vietnam-era Air Force included many members
who had entered its ranks in World War II. President Nixon ended the draft in
1973 in favor of an all-volunteer American military. The Air Force attracted
recruits as best it could but encountered problems with the racial friction and
alcohol and drug abuse that reflected America’s social problems. Enough Vietnam
career veterans remained, however, to direct the new service and implement
changes. One of the most notable of those changes was more realistic- more
dangerous- combat training. In combat simulations, Air Force pilots flew as
aggressors employing enemy tactics. By 1975, training had evolved into Red Flag
at the United States Air Force Weapons and Tactics Center, Nellis Air Force
Base, Nevada. Red Flag aircrews flew both individual sorties and formations in
realistic situations to gain application experience before actual combat.
Colonel Richard “Moody” Suter is the founder of Red Flag. As a major, working
in the Pentagon in 1975, he saw his vision through to fruition. Red Flag
revolutionized Air Force training. According to senior leaders at the time,
Colonel Suter’s efforts resulted in a program that made the United States Air
Force the premier air arm of the world. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.15.2. An innovative genius, Suter flew more than 200
combat missions in Vietnam and was the first F-15 Eagle squadron commander. In
addition to Red Flag, he is credited with founding the Air Force aggressor
squadron, and the Einsiedlerhof Air Station, Germany Warrior Preparation
Center, used to train senior battle commanders in the art of war. Suter was the
driving force behind Checkmate, the Air Force think tank for wartime scenarios.
After his death in January 1996, the Warrior Preparation Center Command Section
Building and Red Flag Building, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, were named in
his honor. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1120" src="image040.png" class="calibre51"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.15.3. Post-Vietnam rebuilding included
applying technology improvements. The battle for control of the skies over
North Vietnam emphasized the need for a highly maneuverable dogfighting aircraft
armed with missiles and cannon. The F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon filled
this need. The danger posed by radar-guided antiaircraft artillery and
surface-to-air missiles in Vietnam drove the Air Force to develop stealth
technology: special paints, materials, and designs to reduce or eliminate
aircraft radar, thermal, and electronic signatures. Operational by October
1980, the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter featured detection avoidance.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.15.4. Other Vietnam War technologies included precision-guided
munitions and smart bombs. From April 1972 to January 1973, the United States
used more than 4,000 early smart weapons to destroy bridges and enemy tanks.
Laserguided bombs, electro-optically-guided missiles, and other precision
technologies changed Air Force doctrine from its focus on strategic bombing to
pinpoint bombing focused on destroying enemy’s industrial web chokepoints with
economy of force and no collateral damage. To overcome numerically superior
Warsaw Pact forces, the Air Force worked with the Army to update the air-land
battle tactical doctrine published in Field Manual 100-5. The Air Force would
make deep air attacks on an enemy army to isolate it on the battlefield,
conduct battlefield air interdiction to prevent enemy reinforcements from
reaching the front, disrupt the movement of secondary forces to the front, and
provide close air support to Army ground forces. The Air Force procured the
A-10 Thunderbolt II in the 1970s to support such missions.  </p>

<p class="msonormal37">1.15.5. Operation RICE BOWL, the April 1980 attempt to
rescue American hostages from the United States embassy in </p>

<p class="msonormal4">Iran, ended in disaster at the Desert
One refueling site. Inquiries led to the reorganization and revitalization of
United States Special Operations Forces. Crisis support missions during the
1980s allowed the Air Force to test new ideas and technologies. During
Operation URGENT FURY, October 1983, American forces rescued American students
and restored order to Grenada. The Air Force primarily transported troops and
cargo, but discovered problems with command, control, planning, and
intraservice &amp; interservice coordination during the operation. In April
1986, President Reagan mobilized England- based F-111s to strike Libya during
Operation ELDORADO CANYON. The </p>

<p class="msonormal10">counterterrorism operation exposed on-going target
identification and intelligence difficulties, punctuated by inaccurate bombing.
Finally, Operation JUST CAUSE in 1989 tested air operations; this time in
Panama. The Air Force primarily airlifted troops and supplies, but also debuted
the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter, with an AC-130 Spectre gunship,
intimidating Panamanian troops loyal to dictator Manuel Noriega. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.15.6. President Kennedy’s flexible-response nuclear war
doctrine of the early 1960s lacked the technology to match its vision of
adapting to meet various Cold War crises. Advances in geodesy, cartography,
missile and satellite guidance system integrated circuits significantly
improved missile accuracy. Technology improvements resulted in better targeting
systems and smaller, more effective warheads. Because they were smaller and
lighter, more warheads could be mounted to intercontinental ballistic missiles
and submarine launched ballistic missiles. In the early 1970s, the Department
of Defense developed multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles,
allowing three or more warheads to be mounted on each intercontinental
ballistic missile and submarine launched ballistic missiles. The Air Force
arsenal peaked at 1,054 Titan and Minuteman intercontinental ballistic
missiles, but many carried three multiple independently targetable reentry
vehicles, as opposed to earlier models that carried a single warhead. In spite
of technological advances, planned targets continued to support the doctrine of
mutually assured destruction or the capacity to eradicate an enemy’s society,
even after an attack on United States forces. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.15.7. Mutually assured destruction doctrine was based on
the theory that superpower strategic nuclear forces could be sized and
protected to survive a nuclear attack in order to retaliate with sufficient
force to destroy the other side. Such retaliatory destruction was deterrent
insurance because no rational leader would consider starting a nuclear war
knowing that the result would be nuclear destruction.  </p>

<p class="msonormal37">1.15.8. For two decades the Air Force developed more capable
satellite systems, such as the Missile Defense Alarm </p>

<p class="msonormal10">System, which was the first attempt at a space-based
long-range missile attack detection and warning system. Missile Defense Alarm System
7, launched 9 May 1963, validated the concept of infrared sensing from a nearly
circular 2,000mile orbit. The need for accurate information on Soviet nuclear
testing led to the development of a space-based system that could specifically
detect nuclear explosions. In September 1959, Department of Defense directed
the Advanced Research Projects Agency to develop the Vela Hotel nuclear
detection program; a low-cost, automated nuclear detection satellite
constellation. The first pair of Vela satellites was launched from Cape
Canaveral, 16 October 1963, and detected a nuclear blast the next day.
Extensive United States and Soviet spending for weapons and related systems
escalated into what appeared to be an unlimited strategic arms race. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.15.9. However, on 26 May 1972, the United States and the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics signed the AntiBallistic Missile Treaty,
limiting each country to two Anti-Ballistic Missile sites: one to protect the
national capital and an intercontinental ballistic missile complex. The treaty
served to reinforce the notion of the mutually assured destruction doctrine as
a deterrent. The Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, which was signed at the same
time, limited the number of nuclear weapons, with the objective of obtaining a
verified freeze on the numerical growth and destabilizing characteristics of
each side’s strategic nuclear forces.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.15.10. Satellite advances significantly enhanced weather
and communications support. The Air Force vision of weather satellites was realized
with the development of a dedicated military weather satellite system known
initially as the Defense Satellite Applications Program. Early Defense
Satellite Applications Program military weather satellites were relatively
unsophisticated, weighing about 430 pounds. The Initial Defense Satellite
Communications Program, launched 16 June 1966, was one of the earliest Air
Force satellite communication systems. Another benefit of early satellites was
improved navigation. Although the Navy produced the first working satellite
navigation system (Transit), an early Air Force navigation satellite program
was designed to provide precise time and navigation information in three
dimensions. Later, a joint Air Force and Navy program would result in what
became known as the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre5"><img id="_x0000_i1119" src="image041.png" class="calibre52"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal4">1.15.11. Increased defense spending
during the early 1980s resulted in more mature space and missile programs (most
of which are still in service) to replace the systems developed in the 1960s
and 1970s. These included the Defense Support </p>

<p class="msonormal53">Program, the Defense Meteorological Satellite
Program, the Defense Satellite Communications System, and the Global Positioning
System. Concurrently, the Air Force developed the ground-based infrastructure
to support, augment, and complement the space-based portions of the systems.
Ground-based systems included the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System;
orbiting space object surveillance using Baker-Nunn cameras; and the Air Force
Satellite Control Network. In addition, the Air Force developed launch support
bases necessary to get satellites into space – one at Cape Canaveral, Florida,
and the other at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The launch bases
provided support not only for Department of Defense sponsored systems but also
for National Aeronautics and Space Agency, other United States government
agencies, and commercial requirements.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.15.12. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the time had
come to substantially reorganize the way the service managed its space systems.
Chief of Staff, Air Force General Lew Allen appeared with Under Secretary of
the Air Force Pete Aldridge, 21 June 1982 to announce the formation of Space
Command, with activation slated for 1 September 1982. Air Force Space Command’s
responsibilities grew quickly over the ensuing decade as it absorbed programs
from Aerospace Defense Command, Air Force Systems Command, and Strategic Air
Command. Eventually command missions included missile warning, space
surveillance, satellite control, space defense, space support to operational
forces, and launch operations. The organizational changes that led to the
establishment of Space Command reflected a growth in the use of space systems
in support of worldwide joint operations.  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.15.13. In a 23 March 1983 address,
President Ronald Reagan proposed replacing the doctrine of mutually assured
destruction with one of assured survival, through implementation of the
Strategic Defense Initiative. Strategic Defense Initiative would include a
combination of defensive systems such as space-based lasers, particle beams,
railguns, and fast ground-launched missiles, among others, to intercept
intercontinental ballistic missiles in the earth’s outer atmosphere and
ballistic path in space. The end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet
Union eliminated the justification for the level of research and development
associated with the project, although research continued at a much-lower level
under the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre5"><img id="_x0000_i1118" src="image042.png" class="calibre53"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1"><sub class="calibre54"><span class="calibre45">Berlin Wall—symbol of the Cold War</span></sub></b></p>

<p class="msonormal54">1.15.14. Beginning in March 1985, Soviet
Communist Party General-Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev initiated major changes in
Soviet-American relations. The Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, in
December 1987, eliminated medium-range nuclear missiles, including United
States Air Force ground-launched cruise missiles. Gorbachev’s announcement in
May 1988 that the Soviet Union, after nine years of <b class="calibre1"><sub class="calibre54"><span class="calibre45"> </span></sub></b>inconclusive
combat, would withdraw from the war in Afghanistan resulted in reduced Cold War
tension, but it was only a hint of the rapid changes ahead. Relatively free and
open Russian national elections in March 1989, followed by a coal miner strike
in July, shook the foundations of Communist rule. East Germany opened the
Berlin Wall in November which led to German reunification in October 1990. The
August 1991 coup against Gorbachev, led by Boris Yeltsin, resulted in the
dissolution of the Soviet Union, replaced 25 December 1991 by the Commonwealth
of Independent States. </p>

<p class="msonormal37">1.15.15. American nuclear strategy changed significantly in
response to these changes. Under the Strategic Arms </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Reduction Treaty I, signed by the United States and the
Soviet Union in July 1991, the Air Force would reduce arms to 6,000 total
warheads on deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine launched
ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers. Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II,
signed in January 1993, would reduce total deployed warheads up to a range of
3,500 nautical miles. The resulting force structure (determined during the
Nuclear Posture Review process overseen by then Secretary of Defense Les
Aspin), would ultimately lead to the deployment of 500 single-warhead Minuteman
III intercontinental ballistic missiles, 66 B-52H, and 20 B-2 heavy bombers.
Ninety-four B-1 heavy bombers would be reoriented to a conventional role by
2003, and all Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles would be removed
from active inventory and associated silo launchers eliminated. The Air Force,
by presidential direction in September 1991, notified Strategic Air Command to
remove heavy bombers from alert status. Strategic Air Command was subsequently
inactivated in June 1992. United States Strategic Command, a unified combatant
command, replaced Strategic Air Command and assumed control of all remaining
Air Force and Navy strategic nuclear forces. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">1.16.
Desert Storm (The Air Campaign against Iraq, 1990-1991):  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal47">1.16.1. On 2 August 1990, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein
ordered 100,000 troops to invade oil-rich Kuwait, claiming </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Kuwait as Iraq’s 19th province. International condemnation
followed, and on 6 August the United Nations authorized an economic embargo.
The same day, President George H. W. Bush announced Operation DESERT SHIELD,
the deployment of United States air and ground units to defend Saudi Arabia and
Persian Gulf states. Within 18 hours of the order, Air Force Military Airlift
Command C-141 and C-5 transports delivered the Army 82d Airborne Division and<span class="calibre7"> </span>elements of the Air Force 1st
Tactical Fighter Wing (whose 48 F-15Cs flew direct). </p>

<p class="msonormal55"><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1117" src="image043.png" class="calibre55"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal55">1.16.2. Operation DESERT SHIELD eclipsed the Berlin Airlift
as the greatest air deployment in history. Military Airlift Command cargo
planes delivered defensive forces 7 August - 8 November 1990, brought
counteroffensive material 9 November - January 1991. The air bridge spanned
more than 7,000 miles and included 20,500 strategic airlift missions. Desert
Shield validated the C-5A Galaxy and C-141 Starlifter large capacity heavy
lifters, which carried 534,000 passengers and 542,000 tons of cargo during the
Gulf War. </p>

<p class="msonormal56">1.16.3. The Gulf War represents
the first, extensive, broad-based employment of space support capabilities.
Coalition forces employed more than 60 military satellites, as well as
commercial and civil sector systems during the conflict. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Defense Meteorological Satellite Program provided dedicated
meteorological support in theater, which helped provide safe, highly effective
combat power planning and application in a harsh environment characterized by
sandstorms and oil fires. Satellite-based systems delivered more than 90
percent of all communications to and from the theater due to the sheer volume
and the lack of ground-based infrastructure. At the height of the conflict,
700,000 phone calls and 152,000 messages per day flowed over satellite links. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.16.4. At 0100, 17 January 1991, three Air Force Special
Operations MH-53J Pave Low helicopters led nine Army Apaches on the first
strike mission of Operation DESERT STORM. </p>

<p class="msonormal57"><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1116" src="image044.png" class="calibre56"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal57">1.16.5. Within hours, the world watched live
television coverage of Iraqi skies filled with antiaircraft artillery fire.
F-117A Nighthawks struck heavily defended targets with unprecedented precision.
Under the command of Lieutenant General Charles A. Horner, United States
Central Command Air Forces, 2,700 aircraft from 14 countries and services
implemented the master attack plan. The coalition effort overwhelmed the Iraqi
air defense system with speed, surprise, precision, and mass. A flight of seven
B-52Gs flew nonstop from Barksdale Air Force Base Louisiana to strike Iraqi
power stations and communications facilities with Air Launched Cruise Missiles.
At 35 hours round-trip, the 14,000-mile raid was the longest combat mission up
to that time and proof of America’s global reach. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.16.6. The first week of Desert Storm focused on achieving
air supremacy and destroying the enemy’s command and control system. Captain
Jon K. “JB” Kelk, flying an F-15C, scored the first air-to-air kill, downing an
Iraqi MiG-29. All total, coalition aircraft shot down 41 Iraqi aircraft, with
Captain Thomas N. “Vegas” Dietz and First Lieutenant Robert W. “Gigs” Hehemann
each credited with three kills. Additionally, Allied air forces destroyed 375
enemy aircraft and 594 hardened bunkers. Faced with coalition air dominance,
148 Iraqi aircraft fled to neighboring Iran.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.16.7. The air campaign then prepared the battlefield by
isolating Iraqi ground units, interdicting supplies, and reducing enemy combat
power. A-10 Thunderbolt II “Warthogs” and F-15Es introduced a new term -tank
plinking - as they destroyed the enemy’s armored forces. F-111F “Aardvarks”
dropped 4,600 of the 8,000 precision-guided munitions.   EF-111A
electronic warfare aircraft provided tactical jamming, while combined RC- 135
Rivet Joint, E-8 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS),
and E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft provided intelligence and
command and control. Perhaps the most spectacular element: B-52s shattered
Iraqi Army morale with massive bomb drops. When one Iraqi commander asserted
that he surrendered because of B-52 strikes, his interrogator pointed out that
his position had never been attacked by the B-52. “That is true, but I saw one
that had been attacked,” said the Iraqi.  </p>

<p class="msonormal15">1.16.8. Not all aspects of the air campaign were successful.
Early in the campaign, Iraq launched modified Soviet Scud missiles against
Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the Persian Gulf states. On 18 January 1991, United
States Air Force A-10s,   F-16s, and F-15Es with Low-Altitude
Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night pods commenced the Great Scud Hunt.
Despite 2,767 sorties (22 percent of the strategic air phase), air patrols did
not destroy a significant number of the missiles. Iraqi camouflage, decoys, and
employment tactics frustrated the effort. The enemy launched 88 Scuds,
including one that struck a United States Army Reserve unit at Dhahran, killing
28 soldiers and wounding 98. The antiScud effort did limit Scud launches after
the first 2 weeks of fighting and reduced the political impact of the weapon. </p>

<p class="msonormal58">1.16.9. The Desert Storm air campaign demonstrated
airpower’s impact on a conventional battlefield. Air Force space assets
provided precision positioning and navigation to joint and coalition forces
with the combat debut of the Global Positioning System. Space forces also
provided the coalition and allies with advanced Iraqi Scud launch warnings.
Defense Support Program gave timely warning of the launch of Iraqi Scud
missiles to United States forces in theater and allowed Patriot batteries in
Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait sufficient time to engage the incoming Iraqi
intermediate range ballistic missiles. Space force capabilities influenced
Israel to remain neutral, thereby preserving the integrity of the allied
coalition. Over the course of the 44-day air campaign, the coalition flew
118,661 sorties, of which the Air Force flew 60 percent. The 1991 Persian Gulf
War brought military space operations to the joint community. The Gulf War was
the first conflict to highlight the force enhancement capabilities of
space-based communications, intelligence, navigation, missile warning, and
weather satellites. Desert Storm also demonstrated the impact of
precision-guided munitions on modern war. Although precision-guided munitions
accounted for only eight percent of the 88,500 tons of bombs dropped, they were
responsible for 80 percent of the destroyed targets. While coalition ground
forces delivered </p>

<p class="msonormal10">General Schwarzkopf’s famous Hail Mary outflanking maneuver
that applied the final blow to the Iraqi military forces, airpower set the
stage for victory. As the Gulf War Air Power Survey stated: It was not the
number of Iraqi tanks or artillery pieces destroyed, or the number of Iraqi
soldiers killed that mattered. It was the effectiveness of the air campaign in
breaking apart the organizational structure and cohesion of enemy military forces
and in reaching the mind of the Iraqi soldier that counted. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">1.17.
Operations PROVIDE RELIEF, IMPRESSIVE LIFT, and RESTORE HOPE—Somalia
(1992-1994): </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.17.1. Civil unrest in the wake of a two-year civil war
contributed to a famine in Somalia that killed up to 350,000 people in 1992. As
many as 800,000 refugees fled the stricken country. The United Nations-led
relief effort began in July 1992. To relieve the suffering of refugees near the
Kenya-Somalia border and then Somalia itself, the United States initiated
Operation PROVIDE RELIEF in August 1992. By December, the United States
airlifted 38 million pounds of food into the region, sometimes under the hail
of small arms fire. Continued civil war and clan fighting within Somalia,
however, prevented much of the relief supplies from getting into the hands of
those who most desperately needed them. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">1.17.2. First, the United Nations,
then the United States, attempted to alleviate the problem. In September, the United
States initiated Operation IMPRESSIVE LIFT to airlift hundreds of Pakistani
soldiers under the United Nations banner to Somalia. Despite the increased
security from the United Nations forces, the problems continued. On 4 December,
President George Bush authorized Operation RESTORE HOPE to establish order in
the country so that food could reach those in need. Marines landed and assumed
control of the airport, allowing flights in and out of Mogadishu, Somalia, to
resume. C-5 Galaxies, C-141 Starlifters, C-130 Hercules, and even KC-10 tankers
rushed supplies into the country. Further, the Operation RESTORE HOPE airlift
brought 32,000 United States troops into Somalia. In March 1993, the </p>

<p class="msonormal21">United Nations once again assumed control of the mission,
and Operation RESTORE HOPE officially ended 4 May 1993. Fewer than 5,000 of the
25,000 United States troops originally deployed remained in Somalia.
Unfortunately, factional fighting within the country caused the relief effort
to unravel yet again. On 3 October 1993, United States special forces troops,
in an effort to capture members of one clan, lost 18 personnel and suffered 84
wounded.  </p>

<p class="msonormal40">1.17.3. In the late afternoon of 3 October
1993, Technical Sergeant Timothy A. Wilkinson, a pararescueman with the 24th
Special Tactics Squadron, responded with his crew to the downing of a United
States UH-60 helicopter in the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia. Wilkinson
repeatedly exposed himself to intense enemy small arms fire while extracting
the wounded and dead crewmembers from the crashed helicopter. Despite his own
wounds, he provided life-saving medical treatment to the wounded crewmembers.
With the helicopter crew taken care of, he turned to aid the casualties of a
ranger security element engaged in an intense firefight across an open four-way

<p class="msonormal10">1.17.4. The losses sustained on 3 and 4 October prompted Operation
RESTORE HOPE II, the airlifting of 1,700 United States troops and 3,100 tons of
cargo into Mogadishu between 5 and 13 October 1993. The troops and equipment
were tasked with only stabilizing the situation: President Clinton refused to
commit the United States to “nation building” and promised to remove United
States forces by March 1994. Operation RESTORE HOPE II officially ended 25
March 1994 when the last C-5 carrying United States troops departed Mogadishu.
While Operation RESTORE HOPE II allowed United States forces to get out of the
country without further casualties, anarchy ruled in Somalia, and the threat of
famine remained. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">1.18.
Operation ALLIED FORCE: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.18.1. The post-Cold War breakup of Yugoslavia proved to be
NATO’s greatest challenge in the 1990s. Militant Serbian nationalism and a
policy of ethnic cleansing, promoted by Yugoslavian President Slobodan
Milosevic, created a crisis in Kosovo in 1999. Meanwhile, Albanian separatists
in the Kosovo Liberation Army fanned the flames of violence. When diplomacy
failed, NATO worried about the possibility of a genocidal civil war and
destabilization throughout the Balkans. As NATO debated intervention, President
Milosevic unleashed a ruthless offensive designed to crush the Kosovo
Liberation Army and drive ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo. Faced with a massive
humanitarian crisis, NATO turned to airpower.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.18.2. After Desert Storm in early 1992, Chief of Staff,
Air Force General Merrill McPeak, introduced a revamped Air Force mission:
Defend the United States through control and exploitation of air and space.
Resultant organizational changes permitted the Air Force to attain an
unprecedented level of integration between air and space capabilities by the
time the Air War over Serbia commenced in 1999. During Air War over Serbia, Air
Force Space Command deployed nearly 150 space professionals to nine locations
in theater. During the conflict, multisource Tactical System/Combat Track I
modifications to five B-52s and two B-1s allowed near real-time information to
flow to the cockpits. The spaceenabled information included threats, target
updates, imagery, and secure communications with the wing operations center.
Global Positioning System satellites provided terminal guidance data for Joint
Direct Attack Munitions, Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missiles, and
Tomahawk Land Attack Missile deliveries. This conflict was the first
operational employment of Joint Direct Attack Munitions, demonstrating
precision adverse weather delivery of multiple weapons against multiple aim
points on a single pass.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.18.3. Optimistic policymakers looked to NATO’s successful
two-week Operation DELIBERATE FORCE in 1995 that brought relative peace to
Bosnia. On 24 March 1999, President Bill Clinton commenced Operation ALLIED
FORCE, announcing three objectives: demonstrate NATO’s opposition to
aggression; deter Milosevic from escalating attacks on civilians; and damage
Serbia’s capability to wage war against Kosovo. Milosevic and Serbian forces
presented United States and NATO forces with an opponent with a capacity for
skilled propaganda and utter ruthlessness. The ensuing 78day battle was
directed against both the Serbian military and Milosevic’s propaganda
efforts.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.18.4. From 24 March to 9 June 1999, NATO air forces walked
a political tightrope. In over 38,000 sorties, 13 of NATO’s 19 nations
attempted to pressure Milosevic, destroy Serbian fielded forces engaged in
Kosovo, and maintain popular support for intervention. Initially, 214 strike
aircraft followed a limited air campaign against approximately 50
targets.  </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1114" src="image046.png" class="calibre58"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.18.5. The B-2 Spirit stealth bomber flew
its first combat missions from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, delivering
650 Joint Direct Attack Munitions in 49 30-hour sorties. On 27 March 1999, Serb
air defenses shot down an Air Force F-117, but Combat Search and Rescue
personnel recovered the pilot. After weeks of caution and frustration, NATO
expanded the scale of the air campaign: 563 United States Air Force aircraft
and 13,850 American Airmen deployed to 24 locations.  </p>

<p class="msonormal12">1.18.6. By June 1999,
NATO airpower accomplished its objectives, although complex political
constraints, abysmal flying weather, and a Serbianmanufactured refugee crisis
hampered progress. Despite a concerted effort to </p>

<p class="msonormal10">avoid civilian casualties, at least 20 major incidents
occurred, including the 7 May 1999 accidental bombing of the Chinese
embassy.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.18.7. The 1999 air campaign against Serbia reinforced
historical lessons on employing air and space power. Despite limitations, air and
space forces proved precise, effective, and rapid. In many ways, a limited air
campaign represented the only means available to coerce an implacable foe.
Assessments of Operation ALLIED FORCE concluded that air and ground commanders
must agree on the enemy’s centers of gravity, and micromanaging the targeting
process limits military effectiveness. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">1.19.
Operations NOBLE EAGLE, ENDURING FREEDOM, and IRAQI FREEDOM (Global War on
Terrorism):  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.19.1. On 11 September 2001, 19 Islamic extremist Al Qaeda
terrorists highjacked four airliners and flew them into the World Trade Center,
the Pentagon, and a remote field in Pennsylvania, killing about 3,000 people.
In response, President George W. Bush declared a global war on terrorism.
Operation NOBLE EAGLE immediately focused on protecting the United States
homeland from both internal and external air attacks of the nature used on
September 11. United States Air Force fighter, tanker, and surveillance air
assets provided 24-hour intercept response coverage for virtually the entire
United States in the form of ground alert and airborne combat air patrols over
designated locations.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.19.2. Operation ENDURING FREEDOM focused on forming and
acting with an international coalition, which included forces from the United
Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, Jordan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Poland,
Russia, Spain, Turkey, and other nations to remove Afghanistan’s Taliban
government. The Taliban sponsored Al Qaeda terrorism and provided a safe haven
for Osama bin Laden, its leader. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre15"><img id="_x0000_i1113" src="image047.png" class="calibre59"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal4">1.19.3. On 7 October 2001, 15 Air
Force bombers, 25 Navy carrierstrike aircraft, and 50 United States and British
sea-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles launched the first wave of Operation
ENDURING FREEDOM military operations. In the opening days of the campaign,
joint airpower destroyed Taliban air defenses, command centers, and other fixed
targets, and protected humanitarian relief missions to the Afghan people. In
contrast to Desert Storm and Allied Force, Taliban and Al Qaeda forces
presented few fixed targets suitable for air attack. Instead, Air Force B-52
bombers carrying Global Positioning System-guided Joint Direct Attack Munitions
flew to engagement zones where ground-based forces directed attacks. Global
Positioning System-guided munitions were employed with great accuracy, enabling
air planners to reduce the number of air sorties required to destroy a particular
objective. Combat operations in </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Afghanistan began with small groups of elite American
military forces deployed to support anti-Taliban Afghani fighters. A number of
the deployed troops carried 2.75-pound Precision Lightweight Global Positioning
System Receivers and satellite-based communications devices. Air Force combat
controllers were among the 300 or so Army, Navy, and Air Force special
operations personnel augmenting the Afghan Northern Alliance. On 13 November
2001, the Afghanistan capital, Kabul, fell to coalition forces. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">1.19.4. One relatively
small but quite significant operation took place on 4 March 2002. The Pentagon
called it Operation ANACONDA and the press referred to it as the battle at
Shah-I-Kot Mountain, but the men who fought there called it the battle of
Robert’s Ridge. In the early morning hours, on a mountaintop called Takur Ghar
in southeastern Afghanistan, al Qaeda soldiers fired on an MH-47E helicopter,
causing a Navy SEAL to fall to the ground, and a chain of events ensued culminating
in one of the most intense small-unit firefights of the war against terrorism,
the death of all the al Qaeda terrorists defending the mountaintop, and the
death of seven United States servicemen. Despite these losses, the United
States forces involved in this fight distinguished themselves by conspicuous
bravery. Their countless acts of heroism demonstrated the best of America’s
Special Operations Forces as Air Force, Army, and Navy special operators fought
side by side to save one of their own and each other, and in the process
secured the mountaintop and inflicted serious loss on al Qaeda.<span class="calibre60"> <sub class="calibre61"> </sub></span></p>

<p class="msonormal12">1.19.5. On 10 January
2003, Secretary of the Air Force posthumously awarded the Air Force Cross to
Technical Sergeant John A. Chapman. It was only the third time since the end of
the Vietnam conflict that an enlisted Airman received the Air Force Cross and
the second time that it went to one of the enlisted Airman who died in what
became a 17-hour ordeal on top of Takur Ghar mountain in Afghanistan. Chapman’s
helicopter came under enemy fire, causing a Navy SEAL to fall out of a MH-47
helicopter during an insertion under fire. The helicopter landed 4.5 miles away
from where the SEAL was killed. Once on the ground, Chapman provided directions
to another helicopter to pick them up. After being rescued, Chapman and the
team volunteered to rescue their mission team member from the enemy stronghold.
After landing, Chapman killed two enemy soldiers and, without regard for his
own life, kept advancing toward a dug-in machinegun nest. The team came under </p>

<p class="msonormal15">fire from three directions. Chapman exchanged fire from
minimum personal cover and succumbed to multiple wounds. His engagement and
destruction of the first enemy position and advancement to the second enabled
his team to move to cover and break enemy contact. He is credited with saving
the lives of the entire rescue team. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.19.6. Afghanistan’s rugged terrain, complex political
relationships, and distance from operating bases challenged coalition forces.
(Navy aircraft flew 700 miles one way from carriers, and Air Force bombers
ventured 2,500 miles one way from Diego Garcia.) Air Force KC- 135 tankers,
C-17 and C-130 airlifters, Red Horse civil engineer teams, spacebased Global
Positioning System and intelligence-gathering satellites, and other support
functions proved to be unsung heroes of the campaign. Their effectiveness
reduced combat troop casualties. In the first 18 months, the Air Force flew
more than 85,000 sorties (75 percent of the total effort), dropped 30,750
munitions, delivered 487,000 tons of cargo, and provided 3,025 intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Even after the defeat of the
Taliban, operations in Afghanistan remained hazardous, as United States and coalition
forces there faced extended counterinsurgency operations. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre5"><img id="_x0000_i1111" src="image049.png" class="calibre63"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.19.7 On 19 March 2003 a coalition of American and allied
forces entered Iraq to end the regime of Saddam Hussein and to free the Iraqi people,
kicking off Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. Much like the Gulf War, Operation IRAQI
FREEDOM came as no surprise to anyone besides Saddam Hussein. On 17 March 2003,
President George W. Bush announced a 48hour ultimatum for Saddam and his sons
to leave Iraq or face conflict. Saddam rejected President Bush’s ultimatum to
flee, and on 20 March a salvo of missiles and laser-guided bombs hit targets
where coalition forces believed Saddam and his sons and other leaders gathered.
Thus the war began.<b class="calibre1"> </b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.19.8. More than 300,000 troops were deployed to the Gulf
region to form a multinational coalition. Combat operations took longer than
the 24-hour war of Operation DESERT STORM. Operation IRAQI FREEDOM officially
began on 20 March 2003, and the primary combat phase ended on 1 May 2003. The
Pentagon unleashed air strikes so devastating they would leave Saddam’s
soldiers unable or unwilling to fight. Between 300 and 400 cruise missiles were
fired at targets, more than the number launched during the entire first Gulf War.
On the second day, the plan called for launching another 300 to 400 missiles.
The battle plan was based on a concept developed at the National Defense
University. Called “Shock and Awe,” it focused on the psychological destruction
of the enemy’s will to fight rather than the physical destruction of the
opposing military force. The concept relies on a large number of
precision-guided weapons hitting the enemy simultaneously, much like a nuclear
weapon strike that takes minutes instead of days or weeks to work. </p>

<p class="msonormal59">1.19.9. Heavy sand storms slowed the coalition advance, but
soldiers reached within 50 miles of Baghdad by 24 March. Missile attacks hit
military facilities in Baghdad on 30 March, and by 2 April, the Baghdad and
Medina divisions of </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Iraq’s Republican Guard were defeated. United States
soldiers seized bridges over the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and then advanced
within 25 miles of Baghdad. The next day, United States Army units along with
Air Force special tactics combat controllers, pararescuemen, and combat
weathermen attacked Saddam International Airport, 10 miles southwest of the
capital. Two days later American-armored vehicles drove through Baghdad after
smashing through Republican Guard units. On 7 April, United States tanks
rumbled through downtown Baghdad and a B–1B bomber attack hit buildings thought
to hold Saddam and other leaders.  </p>

<p class="msonormal12">1.19.10. On 8 April
2003, Staff Sergeant Scott Sather, a combat controller, became the first Airman
killed in Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. The 29-year-old Michigan native earned seven
medals, including the bronze star, during his Air Force career. The citation
accompanying Sather’s Bronze Star Medal with Valor reads, “He led this
reconnaissance task force on combat operations into Iraq on the first day of
the ground war, breeching enemy fortifications during the Iraqi border
crossing. During the next several days Sergeant Sather covered countless miles
conducting specialized reconnaissance in the Southwestern Iraqi desert
supporting classified missions. With only minimal sleep he assumed a leadership
role in the reconnaissance of an enemy airfield opening up the first of five
airheads used by a joint task force to conduct critical resupply of fielded
troops, and provide attack helicopter rearming facilities enabling deep
battlefield offensive operations. Sergeant Sather was then employed to an area
of heavy enemy concentration tasked to provide critical reconnaissance and
intelligence on enemy movement supporting direct action </p>

<p class="msonormal60">missions against enemy forces. Exposed to
direct enemy fire on numerous occasions he continued to provide vital
information to higher headquarters in direct support of ongoing combat
operations. His magnificent skills in the control of close air support aircraft
and keen leadership under great pressure were instrumental in the overwhelming
success of these dangerous missions. Sergeant Sather’s phenomenal leadership
and bravery on the battlefield throughout his deployment were instrumental in
the resounding successes of numerous combat missions performing a significant
role in the success of the war and complete overthrow of the Iraqi regime.” </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.19.11. The withdrawal of American military forces from
Iraq had been a contentious issue within the United States since the beginning of
the Iraq War. As the war progressed from its initial 2003 invasion phase to a
multi-year occupation, United States public opinion turned in favor of troop
withdrawal. In late April 2007, the United States Congress passed a
supplementary spending bill for Iraq that set a deadline, but President Bush
vetoed this bill soon afterwards. All United States Forces were mandated to
withdraw from Iraqi territory by 31 December 2011 under the terms of a
bilateral agreement signed in 2008 by President Bush.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre5"><img id="_x0000_i1110" src="image050.png" class="calibre64"/></span></p>

SSgt. Scott D. Sather</span></sup></b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.19.12. As the deadline for withdrawal drew nearer, the
mission of United States forces in Iraq continued to move away from combat, and
1 September 2010 marked the transition from Operation IRAQI FREEDOM to
Operation NEW DAWN, signifying a formal end to United States military combat
operations. The transition to a supporting role and stability operations was
made possible by increased capability of Iraqi Security Forces and their
improved ability to combat terrorists and provide security for the Iraqi
people. As part of Operation NEW DAWN, United States Forces had three primary
missions: advising, assisting, and training the Iraqi security forces;
conducting partnered counterterrorism operations; and providing support to
provincial reconstruction teams and civilian partners as they help build Iraq’s
civil capacity. The United States troop withdrawal from Iraq was completed on
18 December 2011, early Sunday morning. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.19.13. On 20 March 2011 a collection of aircraft launched
in support of Operation ODYSSEY DAWN to enforce United Nations Security Council
Resolution 1973, centered on protecting Libyan citizens from further harm from
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi’s regime. Following the initial launch of
Tomahawk missiles, three United States aircraft led strikes on a variety of
strategic targets over Libya. United States fighter aircraft created airspace
where no enemy forces could advance on Libyan opposition troops. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.19.14. As already stated, the war in Afghanistan had begun
in 2001, with the stated goal of dismantling the al-Qaeda terrorist
organization and ending its use of Afghanistan as a base. The United States
also said that it would remove the Taliban regime from power and create a
viable democratic state. More than a decade into the war, NATO forces continued
to battle a widespread Taliban insurgency, and the war expanded into the tribal
area of neighboring Pakistan. On 21 May 2012 the leaders of the NATO-member
countries signed off on President Barack Obama's exit strategy from Afghanistan
that called for an end to combat operations in 2013 and the withdrawal of the
United States-led international military force by the end of 2014. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.19.15. On 9 June 2012 French President Francois Hollande
announced his plan to withdraw combat forces by year’s end. In December of that
year, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/15/world/asia/afghanistan-france-troops/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre5"><span class="calibre65">France pulled its
last troops engaged directly in combat out of Afghanistan.</span></a> The
remaining French troops, about 1,500, remained for approximately six months
removing equipment and helping to train Afghan forces. Also on 2 September 2012
United States Special Operations Forces temporarily suspended training of some
1,000 Afghan local police recruits while they double-checked the background of
the current police force, following a rise in insider attacks against NATO
troops by Afghan forces. On September 20, 2012<b class="calibre1"> </b>the surge of United
States forces in Afghanistan ended and the last several hundred surge troops
left the country. On 18 June 2013<b class="calibre1"> </b>Afghan National Security Forces

<p class="msonormal10">1.19.16. For most United States’ and NATO forces, the war in
Afghanistan was over by the end of 2014. At NATO’s International Security
Assistance Force headquarters in Kabul, a ceremony marked the end of
International Security Assistance Force’s mission and the transition to the
NATO-led Resolute Support. The new NATO presence would be more than 12,500
troops to focus on Afghan security forces stability, and United States
personnel would number almost 11,000, including approximately 2,500 Airmen, in
January 2015. The United States Operation ENDURING FREEDOM would be replaced by
Operation FREEDOM’S SENTINEL, the name of the United States portion of NATO’s
Resolute Support. Airmen would continue to work at standing up the Afghan Air
Force, and their mission could continue until the Afghan Air Force becomes
fully independent.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.19.17. In the latter part of 2014, a new and ominous
threat emerged that resulted in United States Airmen again involved in
operations in the skies over Iraq. The enemy, calling themselves the Islamic
State of Iraq and Levant, was an extremist Sunni jihadist organization. Aided
by a number of worldwide recruits and sympathizers, Islamic State of Iraq and
Levant gained control of territory in Syria and northern Iraq (including the
cities of Mosul and Fallujah) exceeding the size of Great Britain, leaving
savage atrocities in their wake, including mass murders and ruthless executions
of innocent civilians. Their brutality resulted in nearly universal
condemnation—even Al Qaeda repudiated them—and President Obama authorized
United States forces, in cooperation with partner nations, to conduct carefully
targeted air strikes over Syria and Iraq, beginning in August, with the aim of
degrading and defeating Islamic State of Iraq and Levant. This operation, under
the name of INHERENT RESOLVE, was still ongoing at the end of 2014. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">1.20.
Historical Perspective Conclusion: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">1.20.1. From Kitty Hawk to
Afghanistan, the record of air and space power emphasizes powerful themes. The
interplay of doctrine, technology, tactics, and strategy must be sustained by
training, logistics, supply, and support infrastructure. Although history may
not provide hard and fast lessons, it offers inspiration, insight, and examples
to spur your thinking. </p>

<p class="msonormal32">Today’s Airmen draw from a proud heritage of sacrifice,
valor, and success. Just as our predecessors triumphed over the challenges at
St. Mihiel, Schweinfurt, and MiG Alley, you will face new challenges with
courage, skill, innovation, and perseverance.  </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.20.2. From the skies over the Rio Grande to those over
Iraq and Afghanistan nearly 100 years later, air power has evolved from an
ineffective oddity to the dominant form of military might in the world. Its
applications and effectiveness have increased with each succeeding conflict; in
World War I air power played a minor role, in Kosovo it played the only role.
In addition to their air combat role, airmen have bravely and successfully
carried out a large number of humanitarian missions, demonstrating the ability
to save lives and alleviate suffering in the face of both natural and manmade
disasters. This chapter has looked at the development of air power through the
nation’s many conflicts and contingencies, spotlighting just a few of the many
contributions of enlisted personnel. </p>

<p class="msonormal59">1.21.1. <b class="calibre1">Orville and Wilbur Wright. </b>The Wright
brothers, bicycle manufacturers from Dayton, Ohio, achieved the first powered,
sustained, controlled airplane flight in 1903, heralding the age of
heavier-than-air aviation. Wilbur was born 16 April 1867, near Millville,
Indiana, and Orville was born     19 August 1871, in
Dayton, Ohio. They became interested in mechanical flight after reading about
Otto Lilienthal’s successful glider experiments in Germany during the 1890s. In
contrast to other experimenters, the Wrights concentrated their efforts on a
threedimensional system of control, using an elevator and twisting the wings
(called warping) in combination with a vertical rudder. A series of biplane
gliders in 1902 led to a development of a perfectly controllable glider capable
of generating sufficient lift. Subsequently, the brothers designed and built a
relatively lightweight gasoline engine and revolutionary, highly efficient
propellers for the 1903 flyer. Using that aircraft, they successfully flew four
manned missions 17 December 1903 at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In 1904 and
1905, the Wright brothers conducted experiments at Huffman Prairie, near
Dayton, and introduced a new improved aircraft each year. The 1905 Wright flyer
is generally recognized as the first practical airplane. It could turn, bank,
fly figure eights, and remain aloft for over 30 minutes. It was not until 1907
that the Signal Corps established an Aviation Section and issued a bid for a
military airplane. Tests of the Wright military machine began at Fort Myer,
Virginia, in 1908. A crash 17 September 1908, however, seriously injured
Orville, killed passenger Lieutenant Thomas E. Selfridge, and temporarily
interrupted testing. A new machine accepted in the fall of 1909 was the United
States Army’s first airplane: Signal Corps No. 1. Subsequently the Wright
brothers trained several United States Army pilots, including Henry H. “Hap”
Arnold, future commander of the United States Army Air Forces during World War
II. The Wright Aircraft Company sold the Army several airplanes. The Wrights,
however, remained wedded to the wing warping system of control and their
airplanes became increasingly inferior and uncompetitive, while those of rivals
like Glenn Curtiss improved rapidly in performance. Wilbur died of typhoid
fever 30 May 1912, and Orville later sold the Wright Company and assumed a less
active role in aviation. He remained, however, the “father” of flying and a
highly honored individual until his death 30 January 1948.</p>

<p class="msonormal62">1.21.2. <b class="calibre1">Colonel William “Billy”
Mitchell</b>. Colonel Mitchell was an airpower visionary who saw the airplane
dominating warfare and called for an air force independent of the United States
Army.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.2.1. Born to wealthy American parents in
Nice, France, on 29 December 1879, he grew up in Wisconsin. He attended Racine
College and Columbian College (now George Washington University in Washington,
District of Columbia) but abandoned college at the beginning of the
Spanish-American War and enlisted in the military. His father, a United States
Senator, applied influence and he received a commission. Intelligent, able, and
aggressive, Mitchell was the youngest captain ever selected to join the General
Staff (1912).  </p>

<p class="msonormal64">1.21.2.2. In 1915,
Mitchell joined the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps and the following year
he took private flying lessons. During much of 1918, he commanded most of the
United States air combat units at the front. He added the use of aircraft in
mass to overwhelm the enemy to the British doctrine of taking the offensive. In
September 1918, he massed more than 1,500 United States and Allied aircraft in
support of the St. Mihiel offensive. In April 1921, Mitchell became Assistant
to the Chief of the Air Service. His outspoken advocacy of a separate air
force, critical remarks about the poor quality of the Air Service, and
criticism of superiors caused considerable controversy. Worse was his
methodology, which relied on appeals to Congress and the public outside the
chain of command, often in violation of direct orders. His claims that the
airplane could sink battleships ultimately led to bombing trials in June 1921.
During these trials, the 1st Provisional Air Brigade under Mitchell’s
leadership sank the former German battleship <i class="calibre2">Ostfriesland</i>, which was
probably the high point of Mitchell’s military career.  </p>

<p class="msonormal64"> </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.2.3. Major General Mason Patrick, Air
Service commander after the bombing trials, was able to keep Mitchell out of
trouble for a time, but in 1925 further activities led the War Department to
refuse to reappoint him as Assistant Chief. Mitchell reverted to his permanent
rank of colonel and was assigned to Fort Sam Houston, Texas.  </p>

<p class="msonormal65">1.21.2.4. Even from Texas, Mitchell used the
press to continue to advocate an independent air force. After the Navy
dirigible <i class="calibre2">Shenandoah</i> was destroyed in a storm, he charged senior
military leadership with incompetence. </p>

<p class="msonormal63">President Coolidge personally ordered
Mitchell’s court-martial, and he was found guilty of insubordination. Mitchell
resigned his commission 1 February 1926 and died 19 February 1936. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><span class="calibre5"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1107" src="image053.png" class="calibre68"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal4">1.21.3. <b class="calibre1">Major General Benjamin D.
“Benny” Foulois</b>. Foulois was a pioneer aviator and the first commander of
an American air unit in the field. He was born in Connecticut, 9 December 1879.
He enlisted in the Army at the time of the Spanish-American War and was
commissioned during his service in the Philippines in 1901. In 1907, Foulois
entered the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps. In 1908 and 1909, Foulois
participated in the acceptance tests of the Army’s first semirigid dirigible
and its first airplane, a Wright flyer designated Signal Corps No. 1. In 1910,
Foulois took Signal Corps No. 1 to Fort Sam Houston, Texas, where he conducted
tests to demonstrate its military usefulness. He remained in aviation until his
retirement in 1935. In subsequent years, Foulois participated in all aspects of
early United States Army aviation and in 1915, completed the organization of
the Army’s first operational unit, the 1st Aero Squadron. Foulois commanded the
squadron during the Mexican Punitive </p>

<p class="msonormal17">Expedition in 1916-1917; the first deployment of a United
States Army air unit to the field. Following the Punitive Expedition, Foulois
went to Washington, District of Columbia, where he played a major role in
planning and implementing the $640 million aviation program begun after the
United States entered World War I. Foulois was promoted to brigadier general
and named Chief of the Air Service for the American Expeditionary Force in
November 1917. </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.3.1. He was unsuccessful, however, and
was replaced by General Patrick in May 1918. Foulois’ subsequent work,
especially as Patrick’s assistant, however, played a major role in Air Service
success during the war. </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.3.2. In 1927, he moved to Washington,
District of Columbia, to become Assistant Chief of the Air Service, and in 1931
was promoted to major general and named Chief of the Air Corps. Foulois proved
a less-thaneffective Air Corps leader. A hands-on individual, he tried to spend
more time in the cockpit and less in the office. A firm advocate of strategic
bombardment and an independent air force, his testimony before Congress was
usually blunt and straightforward. </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.3.3. In 1934, Foulois agreed on short
notice that the Air Corps could fly the United States mail. The service proved
ill-equipped for the effort, which damaged Foulois’ reputation. However, during
his tenure, the Air Corps acquired its first B-17 heavy bombers and he helped
organize General Headquarters Air Force in 1935; a significant step toward Air
Force independence. General Foulois retired 31 December 1935 and died 25 April
1967. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.21.4. <b class="calibre1">General of the Air Force Henry H.
“Hap” Arnold</b>. General Arnold was an aviation pioneer and is generally
recognized as the father of the modern United States Air Force, commanding the
United States Army Air Forces during World War II. Arnold was born in Gladwyne,
Pennsylvania, 25 June 1886, and graduated from West Point in 1907. Originally
an infantryman, he became a flyer in 1911. His career paralleled the early
development of United States military aviation. In April 1911, the Signal Corps
sent Arnold to Dayton, Ohio, where Wilbur and Orville Wright taught him to fly.
In 1912, he won the first Mackay Trophy for making the most meritorious
military flight of the year. <i class="calibre2">Promoted</i> to temporary colonel, Arnold spent
most of World War I as the highest-ranking flying officer in Washington,
District of Columbia. He would apply the lessons he learned during the Great
War to the development of the United States Army Air Forces. Arnold began his
rise to command of the Army Air Corps during the interwar years, serving in Air
Service headquarters in Washington, District of Columbia, and in several of the
most important operational flying commands in the field. Promotion to
lieutenant colonel came in 1931 and with it command of March Field, California.
In 1934, he took command of the western zone of the United States.  </p>

<p class="msonormal67">1.21.4.1. In 1934, Arnold again won the
Mackay Trophy, leading a flight of 10 B-10 bombers from Washington, District of
Columbia, to Fairbanks, Alaska. On 29 September 1938, he was named Chief of the
Air Corps. On    30 June 1941, he became Commanding General of
the United States Army Air Forces.  </p>

<p class="msonormal68">1.21.4.2. General Arnold commanded America’s aerial war
effort in World War II. Under his direction, the United </p>

<p class="msonormal63">States Army Air Forces expanded from 22,000
members and 3,900 aircraft to nearly 2.5 million members and 75,000 aircraft.
Throughout the war he remained committed to strategic bombardment, laying the
foundation for a post-war independent air force. He directly commanded the 20th
Air Force B-29s during their 1944 and 1945 assault on Japan. Supervising the
air war on a global scale proved a strenuous task. Arnold had a severe heart
attack that led to his 30 June 1946 retirement.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.4.3. On 7 May 1949, Congress appointed
Arnold the first and only five-star General of the Air Force. (He was a
five-star General of the Army in 1944.) General Arnold died at his home in
Sonoma, California, 15 January 1950. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre5"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1105" src="image055.png" class="calibre70"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.21.5. <b class="calibre1">General Carl A. “Tooey” Spaatz</b>. General
Spaatz, first Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, was born 28 June
1891, in Boyertown, Pennsylvania. He graduated from West Point in 1914, entered
the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps in October 1915, and earned his wings
in 1916. During World War I, Spaatz served in France. He flew in combat for
only three weeks but still shot down three German planes. General Spaatz was
one of the pioneering aviators of the interwar years. For nearly a week, 1-7
January 1929, Spaatz and several other officers kept the Question Mark, a Fokker
trimotor, aloft over California. During the 151-hour flight, the Question Mark
refueled in the air 37 times, nine of those after dark. In June 1933, he was
assigned to Washington, District of Columbia, as Chief of the Air Corps
Training and Operations Division. While attending the Command and General Staff
School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in September 1935, he was promoted to
lieutenant colonel. In 1936, Spaatz was assigned as the executive officer, 2d
Bomb Wing, Langley Field, Virginia. He returned to Washington in 1939 to serve
as Assistant Executive Officer to the Chief of the Air Corps. In November 1939,
he was promoted to colonel and transferred to England to serve as a military
observer. In October 1940, Spaatz returned to Washington to accept a promotion
to brigadier general and an assignment as Assistant to the Chief of the Air
Corps. </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.5.1. After the war began, Spaatz
advanced rapidly through a succession of jobs. He commanded Eighth Air Force
before accepting command of the Northwest African Air Forces. On 6 January
1944, he assumed command of United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe,
tasked with softening up Hitler’s Fortress Europe, before the Allied invasion.
General Spaatz pinned on his fourth star in March 1945, prior to assuming
command of United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific Theater. He
oversaw the final strategic bombing campaign against Japan, including the 1945
use of atomic weapons against Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.5.2. In February 1946, Spaatz was
promoted to Commanding General of the Army Air Forces and in September 1947,
President Harry S. Truman appointed him Chief of Staff of the United States Air
Force. He retired 30 June 1948, after which he served as the Civil Air Patrol
Chairman and Air Force Association Chairman of the Board from 1940 to 1951. A
leading advocate of an Air Force Academy, General Spaatz died in Washington,
District of Columbia, 14 July 1974. </p>

<p class="msonormal69">1.21.6. <b class="calibre1">Lieutenant General Frank M.
Andrews</b>. General Andrews was one of the founding fathers of the modern Air
Force and commander of the first combat Air Force. Killed in an aircraft
accident near Iceland, 3 May 1943, General Andrews was one of the most
promising Army Air Forces generals. Born in Nashville, Tennessee, 3 February
1884, he graduated from West Point in 1906 and entered the cavalry. He served
at several posts, from the Philippines to Vermont, before joining the Aviation
Division in August 1917, serving in the Office of the Chief Signal Officer. In
1918, he was assigned to the Army General Staff Plans Division. He was assigned
to Germany in August 1920, where he served for three years in public relations
and civil affairs. Andrews returned to Kelly Field, Texas, in 1923, to serve as
executive officer and, eventually, Commandant of Flying. After attending the
Air Corps Tactical School, he was assigned to 2d Wing Headquarters, Langley
Field, Virginia, as a staff officer. Andrews completed the Army War College in
May 1933, and subsequently, became Commander, 1st Pursuit Group at Selfridge
Field, Michigan. In October 1934, he returned to Washington for a second tour
on the General Staff.   </p>

<p class="msonormal69"> </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.6.1. In March 1935, General Andrews
assumed command of the newly created General Headquarters Air Force. In August
1939, he was named the Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations and
Training. In 1940, Andrews pinned on his second star and in September 1941 was
named Commanding General, Caribbean Defense Command.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.6.2. Andrews was promoted to lieutenant
general after America entered World War II, when he assumed command of United
States Forces in the Middle East. In February 1943, he accepted command of
United States Forces in the European Theater. His premature death ended a
career that showed great promise. In June 1949, Andrews Air Force Base in
Maryland was named in his honor. </p>

<p class="msonormal37"><span class="calibre5"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1103" src="image057.png" class="calibre72"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal37">1.21.7.<b class="calibre1"> General Ira C. Eaker</b>. General Eaker, aviation
pioneer and articulate advocate of aerospace power, was born in </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Field Creek, Texas, 13 April 1896. In 1917, he graduated
from Southeastern State Teachers College. After accepting a commission in the
Army Reserve, he attended flight school. His first assignment was to the
Philippines, where he did graduate work at the University of the Philippines
before returning to Mitchel Field, New York, in 1922. While serving in New
York, he studied law at Columbia University.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.7.1. General Eaker was a daring and innovative
aviator. He participated in the Pan-American goodwill tour of 1926 and 1927,
and flew in the first extended aerial refueling experiment in 1929, during
which the crew kept a plane aloft for 151 hours.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.7.2. In the 1930s, as war loomed over
Europe, Eaker returned to Washington, District of Columbia, to serve in the
office of the Chief of the Air Corps. In 1940, as a lieutenant colonel, he
accepted command of the 20th Pursuit Group at Hamilton Field, California. In
January 1942, shortly after the United States entered World War II, Eaker took
command of the VIII Bomber Command and was promoted to brigadier general. A
strong advocate of daylight strategic bombardment, he convinced Prime Minister
Winston Churchill that it had merit. Eaker directed the daylight campaigns that
pounded the German military and industrial base of Nazi-occupied Europe and
Germany.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.7.3. In September 1943, after promotion
to lieutenant general, he served as commander of the Mediterranean Allied Air
Forces. After the war and until his August 1947 retirement, General Eaker was
Deputy Commander, United States Army Air Forces and Chief of the Air
Staff.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.7.4. In 1947, General Eaker accepted a
position as vice president of Hughes Tool Company. He served as a vice president
of Douglas Aircraft from 1957-1961. In retirement, General Eaker was an active
writer, with regularly published articles and columns in numerous newspapers
and military journals. President Reagan promoted him to four-star general, 10
April 1985. He died 6 August 1987. </p>

<p class="msonormal70">1.21.8. <b class="calibre1">Major General Oliver P. Echols</b>. General
Echols, a pioneer logistician who coordinated the rapid expansion of America’s
air arsenal during World War II, was born in Charlottesville, Virginia, on 4
March 1892. Logistics play a vital role in warfare, and his contribution was
notable. </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.8.1. Echols attended Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and the University of Virginia, graduating in 1913. After
graduation he enlisted in the United States Army. He was commissioned in 1916
and was stationed in Europe with the Air Service in July 1917. He commanded the
1st Observation Group and later became chief of aviation for the 1st Army
Corps. During World War I, Echols saw action in several battles including those
of the Chateau-Thierry, Aisne, St. Mihiel, and in the Meuse-Argonne
offensive.  </p>

<p class="msonormal64">1.21.8.2. After the
war, following several flying assignments, Echols served in the Air Corps
Experimental Engineering Section from 1927 to 1930. The following year he
became chief of the Air Corps Procurement Section. After graduating from the
Air Corps Tactical School in 1932, Echols returned to the procurement field as
Chief Engineer, Air Corps Materiel Division. In 1938, he was promoted to
assistant chief, and earned his first star and the promotion to division chief
in October 1940. During World War II, General Echols coordinated the most
massive aircraft procurement program in history, as Chief, Army Air Forces
Materiel Division. In 1947, he retired, accepting an offer to run the Aircraft
Industries Association. He died 15 May 1954. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre5"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1101" src="image059.png" class="calibre74"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.21.9. <b class="calibre1">Captain Lillian K. Keil</b>. A pioneer in
passenger care, Captain Keil successfully combined two careers (airline flight
attendant and Air Force flight nurse) to become the most decorated woman in
United States military history. Keil was one of the first stewardesses hired by
United Airlines when the United States entered World War II. She was later
accepted into the Army Air Forces and by the summer of 1943, she was in England
pulling wounded and frostbitten crewmen out of B-17s returning from bombing
raids over Europe. D-Day, 6 June 1944, found her aboard a C-47, heading for
Normandy to collect the wounded. During the war, Keil made 250 evacuation
flights, 23 of which were transatlantic.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.9.1. After World War II, Keil returned
to United Airlines as an assistant chief stewardess. In 1950, she returned to
duty as an Air Force flight nurse and flew to Korea. During the next 16 months,
she flew 175 air evacuations, logging 1,400 hours of flight time while assigned
to the 801st Medical Air Evacuation Transportation Squadron.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.9.2. The Army Air Forces captain
attended to more than 10,000 wounded soldiers, sailors, and marines in the air.
She was awarded 19 medals, including a European Theater medal with 4 battle
stars, a Korean service medal with 7 battle stars, 4 air medals, and a
Presidential Citation from the Republic of Korea.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.9.3. Honored several times by her
hometown of Covina Hills, California, she was active in the Covina Hills
Veterans of Foreign Wars chapter until her death 30 June 2005. </p>

<p class="msonormal71"><span class="calibre5"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1100" src="image060.png" class="calibre75"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.21.10. <b class="calibre1">General George C. Kenny</b>. The
United States Army Air Forces produced many great operational air commanders in
World War II. Leaders like Spaatz, Eaker, LeMay, and Doolittle richly deserve
acclaim, but some historians rank General Kenney first among equals for his
ability to overcome severe organizational, logistical, personnel, technical,
and strategic difficulties.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.10.1. Kenney distinguished himself in
World War I, flying 75 missions, downing two German planes, and receiving the
Distinguished Service Cross and Silver Star.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.10.2. His Army Air Corps experiences
enabled him to command air forces with such success during World War II. He was
the quintessential Air Corps officer in the sense that his experience
encompassed a broad range of functions, from maintenance, supply, and
production to strategy, tactics, and operations. He gained a reputation as a
technical and tactical innovator.  </p>

<p class="msonormal72">1.21.10.3. During World War II, as commander
of the Southwest Pacific Area Allied Air Forces and the Fifth Air Force, Kenney
was General MacArthur’s Airman. He created clear lines of authority, instituted
new supply and maintenance programs, commanded with authority, and earned the
respect and admiration of his men. Perhaps the most daring and innovative
commander of the war, Kenney gained MacArthur’s confidence because he knew how
to run combat air forces and produced results quickly.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.10.4. Toward the end of the war in the
Pacific, General Arnold cabled Kenney: “It may truthfully be said that no air commander
ever did so much with so little.” MacArthur wrote: “Of all the commanders of
our major Air Forces engaged in World War II, none surpassed General Kenney in
those three great essentials of successful combat leadership - aggressive
vision, mastery over air strategy and tactics, and the ability to exact the
maximum in fighting quality from both men and equipment.” General Kenney died 9
August 1977. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre5"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1099" src="image061.png" class="calibre76"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.21.11. <b class="calibre1">General James “Jimmy” Doolittle</b>. In a career
defined by variety, General Doolittle was a renaissance man: an air leader,
aeronautical engineer, airplane racer, businessman, commanding general, oil
company executive, special assistant to the Chief of Staff of the United States
Air Force, and holder of the Medal of Honor. Doolittle was born 14 December
1896, in Alameda, California. After a year at the California School of Mines,
he joined the Signal Corps Reserve in 1917 and earned his wings in 1918. Over
the next 4 years he accepted a variety of assignments in the Signal Corps
aviation section, demonstrating exceptional ability as a pilot and as a
daredevil. He also continued his education, earning a bachelor’s degree from
the University of California in 1922, a master’s degree from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1924, and a Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1925.  </p>

<p class="msonormal64">1.21.11.1. His aviation
accomplishments are legendary. In September 1922, he flew a DH-4 coast-to-coast
in 22 hours, 35 minutes, with only one refueling stop. In 1925, he won the
Schneider Trophy Races, setting a seaplane speed record of </p>

<p class="msonormal63">245.713 mph. He helped develop fog-flying
equipment in 1928, which led to widespread use of the artificial horizontal and
directional gyroscopes. He made the first “blind” flight, completely dependent
on instruments, for which he won the Harmon Trophy.   </p>

<p class="msonormal73">1.21.11.2. He served as Army advisor on the
building of Floyd Bennett Field, New York City’s first municipal airport. 
</p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.11.3. Doolittle resigned his regular
commission in 1930 to manage Shell Oil’s aviation department. As part of his
duties with Shell, he helped develop high-octane gasoline and sold the Air
Corps on the development of high-compression engines using that fuel.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.11.4. General Arnold brought Doolittle
back to active duty in 1940 to troubleshoot engine and aircraft development,
but Doolittle is best remembered for leading the 18 April 1942 B-25 raid on
Tokyo, launched from the deck of the aircraft carrier Hornet. Though all 16 aircraft
were lost, the raid restored American morale and damaged Japanese confidence.
It also earned Doolittle the Medal of Honor and promotion to brigadier
general.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.11.5. Promoted to major general in
November 1942, he commanded Twelfth Air Force in North Africa and in January
1944 took command of Eighth Air Force in England. He was promoted to lieutenant
general               
13 March 1944.  </p>

<p class="msonormal74">1.21.11.6. After World War II, Doolittle
returned to civilian life as vice president of Shell Oil. He was promoted to
four-star General on the Air Force retired list in June 1985 and died 27
September 1993.<b class="calibre1">  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal75"><span class="calibre5"><img border="0" id="_x0000_i1098" src="image062.png" class="calibre77"/></span></p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.21.12. <b class="calibre1">Major General Claire L.
Chennault</b>. Nicknamed “Old Leatherface,” General Chennault, famed leader of
the Flying Tigers, was born 6 September 1890 in Commerce, Texas. He grew up in
Louisiana and attended Louisiana State University before joining the United
States Army.  </p>

<p class="msonormal64">1.21.12.1. Chennault
was commissioned a first lieutenant in November 1917 and earned his wings at
Kelly Field, Texas, in 1919. During the 1920s, Chennault earned a reputation as
a talented “stick and rudder man” and an absolute master of pursuit (fighter)
tactics. As a captain, Chennault graduated from the Air Corps Tactical School
in 1931, then remained at the school as an instructor, eventually becoming head
of the Pursuit Section. During the 1930s, such Air Corps Tactical School
instructors as Harold George, Robert Olds, and Kenneth Walker developed
doctrine advocating high altitude, daylight, precision bombing of key enemy
industrial and military targets using heavy bombers. In contrast, Chennault
stressed the importance of pursuit aviation, and advocated a system of air
defense based upon early warning of an enemy attack. Technology in the 1930s
was not in Chennault’s favor. Bombers like the B-10 and B-17 became larger and
faster, and pursuers fell increasingly behind.  </p>

<p class="msonormal64"> </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.12.2. Forced to retired in 1937 for
health reasons, Chennault went to China shortly after to train pilots for the
Chinese Air Force.   </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.12.3. In 1941, Chennault recruited
American military pilots and organized the American Volunteer Group under a
carefully hidden Roosevelt Administration program to provide an air force for
Chinese leader Chiang Kaishek. Chennault trained three squadrons of “Flying
Tigers” in tactics he had developed that took advantage of the strengths of his
Curtiss P-40s and exploited enemy weaknesses.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.12.4. Though the American Volunteer Group
did not enter combat until after Pearl Harbor, the unit gained fame for its
victorious exploits during the first six months of World War II. In April 1942,
the United States Army Air Forces recalled Chennault to active duty, in the
grade of major general, to command Fourteenth Air Force in China. In that
capacity, he fought two wars: one against the Japanese and another against
supply and equipment problems in isolated China.  </p>

<p class="msonormal76">1.21.12.5. In October 1945, General Chennault
retired again and in 1946 became president of the China-based Civil Air
Transport Company, assisting Chiang Kai-shek’s losing fight against Chinese
Communist forces. On 18 July 1958, the Air Force promoted Chennault to the

<p class="msonormal77">1.21.13. <b class="calibre1">General Curtis E. LeMay</b>. General LeMay, who
made Strategic Air Command the world’s premier force, was born 15 November
1906. He attended the Ohio State </p>

<p class="msonormal69">University and was commissioned through the
Reserve Officer Training Corp program in </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1928. His military career began in September 1928 with
flight training at March Field, California.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.13.1. General LeMay flew pursuit planes
until 1937, when he transferred to the 2d Bomb Group, Langley Field, Virginia.
There, he earned a reputation as an outstanding pilot and exceptional
navigator. Accordingly, in late 1937 and early 1938, he served as lead
navigator for two mass flights of B-17s to South America.  </p>

<p class="msonormal78">1.21.13.2. LeMay was promoted to captain in
January 1940, major in March 1941, and lieutenant colonel in January 1942. He
pinned on eagles three months later, when he took command of the 305th
Bombardment Group at Muroc, California. Later that year, his group joined the
Eighth Air Force in England. LeMay’s no-nonsense approach to combat earned him
his first and second stars in September 1943 and March 1944. In August 1944, he
assumed command of the XX Bomber Command in the Pacific. His B-29s were charged
with destroying Japan’s war-making potential. After the war, LeMay served at
the Pentagon before his promotion and assignment as Commander, United States
Forces in Europe, in October 1947. His success at directing the Berlin Airlift
in 1948 made him the obvious choice for Strategic Air Command
commander-in-chief, in October 1948.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.13.3. LeMay made Strategic Air Command
the world’s most powerful nuclear force. In the days before the deployment of
guided missiles, LeMay developed Strategic Air Command’s policy of constant
alert, keeping some bombers aloft at all times, ready to respond to a Soviet
attack.  </p>

<p class="msonormal64">1.21.13.4. In 1957,
General LeMay became Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, and in June 1961 rose to
Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force. He held that post until his
retirement in February 1965. In 1968 he became the vice presidential candidate
on the American Independent Party ticket, headed by Alabama Governor George C.
Wallace. Defeated in November, LeMay returned to private life as chairman of the
board of an electronics firm. He died 1 October 1990. </p>

<p class="msonormal80">1.21.14. <b class="calibre1">Lieutenant General William H.
Tunner</b>. Known as the Air Force’s outstanding practitioner of air logistics
and air mobility, General Tunner was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1906.
After graduating from the United States Military Academy in 1928, he entered
the Air Corps and during the 1930s earned a reputation as an excellent pilot
and hardworking intelligence officer. During World War II, Tunner helped create
the United States Army Air Forces Ferrying Command. By the time it became Air
Transport Command, it was delivering 10,000 aircraft monthly from stateside
factories to worldwide theaters of operation.  </p>

<p class="msonormal64">1.21.14.1. In 1944,
Tunner assumed command of the “Hump” airlift operation, supplying China from
India over some of the world’s highest mountain ranges. The often appalling
terrain and weather, equipment, facilities, and aircraft shortages made the
“Hump” a difficult operation. Tunner refined and standardized every element of
the operation, implementing assembly-line maintenance, systemizing
cargo-handling procedures, emphasizing flight safety, and imbuing the operation
with a driving </p>

<p class="msonormal63">commitment to increase tonnage. In July 1945
alone, Air Transport Command delivered 71,042 tons of cargo. In June 1948, Air
Transport Command and the Naval Air Transport Service merged, becoming the
Military Air Transport Service, and Tunner assumed command of its Atlantic Division 
</p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.14.2. On 24 June 1948, the Soviet Union
blockaded the surface routes between Berlin and the Western occupation zones in
Germany. Allied leaders ordered an airlift to supply Berlin, 26 June. On 28
July, Tunner assumed command of the airlift, Operation VITTLES. Tunner
developed an intricate bridge of aircraft that flowed in a steady stream
through narrow corridors in and out of Berlin. Before the Soviet Union lifted
the blockade 12 May 1949, Operation VITTLES delivered 2.3 million tons of cargo
to Berlin. Under Tunner, the Berlin Airlift emerged as an epic enterprise,
demonstrating the peaceful use of airpower as a political instrument.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.14.3. When the Korean War broke out in
June 1950, General Tunner took command of Combat Cargo Command (Provisional).
Tunner illustrated how a fleet of cargo aircraft was sufficiently flexible to
handle airborne assault while airdropping supplies, and moving cargo and
personnel through a combat theater. In the mid-1950s, Tunner commanded United
States Air Forces in Europe.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.14.4. His 1958 assumption of command of
Military Air Transport Service provided the platform from which he advocated
large, jet-powered transports to support the global mission. General Tunner
retired in May 1960 and died 6 April 1983. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">1.21.16. <b class="calibre1">General Bernard A. Schriever</b>.
Born in Germany, 14 September 1910, General Schriever is recognized as the
architect of Air Force ballistic missile and military space programs. He came
to America in 1917 and was naturalized in 1923. Raised in San Antonio, Texas,
he graduated from Texas A&amp;M in 1931 with a bachelor of science degree in
engineering. He was commissioned in the Field Artillery but in July 1932 began
flight training at Randolph Field, earning his Air Corps wings and commission
at Kelly Field in June 1933. He was a bomber pilot at March and Hamilton
Fields, California.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.16.1. He participated in the ill-fated
Army airmail program during the winter of 1934. He served at Albrook Field, but
in September 1937, he resigned from the Air Corps to become a commercial pilot.
Schriever returned to active duty in October 1938, serving with the 7th Bomb
Group at Hamilton, and a year later became a test pilot at Wright Field. While
there, he also attended the Air Corps Engineering School, graduating in July
1941. He then earned his master of science degree in aeronautical engineering
at Stanford University.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.16.2. Schriever distinguished himself
during World War II, flying combat missions in the Pacific theater. He took
part in the Bismarck Archipelago, Leyte, Luzon, Papua, North Solomon, South
Philippine, and Ryukyu campaigns. After the war, Schriever, a colonel,
transferred to Headquarters Army Air Forces to serve as chief scientific
liaison in the Materiel directorate. In June 1950, he graduated from the
National War College and returned to the Pentagon. In June 1953 he was promoted
to brigadier general. Schriever began his long association with Air Research
and Development Command, later Systems Command, in June 1954 as assistant to
the commander. He was later appointed to head the Western Development Division
to organize and form what would become the ballistic missile and space
divisions that produced the Atlas, Titan, Thor, and Minuteman. He also produced
the launchers and space systems that supported the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration and other government agencies.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.16.3. In April 1959, Schriever was named
to head Air Research and Development Command. Two years later, he was promoted
to four-star general, and named to head the new Air Force Systems
Command.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.16.4. He brought his systems approach to
Air Force Systems Command and applied it to major aeronautics and space
programs. Schriever established 437L, an antisatellite system, as part of his
efforts to extend the Air Force mission to include space and personally headed
the Manned Orbiting Laboratory Project. He retired in August 1966 and died 20
June 2005. </p>

Cochran</b>. Colonel Cochran was born in 1910 in Pensacola, Florida. She was
the first female pilot to break the sound barrier, doing so 18 May 1953.  </p>

<p class="msonormal82">1.21.17.1. After flying lessons at Roosevelt Field, Long
Island, in 1932, she obtained her license in 2 ½ weeks, bought a plane, and
began taking additional flying lessons from Ted Marshall, a Navy pilot.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.17.2. In 1934, after obtaining a
commercial pilot’s license, she entered the MacRobertson Trophy Air Race from
London to Melbourne, Australia. Although she didn’t win the 12,000-mile race,
she won the first leg.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.17.3. In 1935, she founded a cosmetic
company and used the business to help finance the races she entered. Next, she
entered the Bendix Trophy Transcontinental Race (the Bendy), a cross country
race from Los Angeles to Cleveland. No woman had ever competed in this
prestigious race, and Cochran’s and Amelia Earhart’s applications were
initially denied because of their gender. But they protested and were allowed
to compete. Cochran’s plane had mechanical problems, but Earhart came in fifth.
Cochran won first place in the women’s division and third place overall in 1937
and took first place in 1938. In 1938, Cochran flew from New York to Miami in a
record-breaking 4 hours, 12 minutes.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.17.4. In 1939, she set a new altitude
and international speed record and became the first woman to make a blind
landing. In 1940, she broke the 2,000-kilometer international speed record. She
received the Clifford Burke Harmon Trophy as the outstanding woman flier in the
world in 1938, 1939, and 1940.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.17.5. During World War II, she organized
25 women to fly for Great Britain and became the first woman to fly a bomber across
the Atlantic. She received the Distinguished Service Medal for her services
during the War.  </p>

staff of the United States Army Air Forces and director of the Women’s Air
Force Service Pilots. She also set nine international speed, distance, and
altitude jet records.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.17.7. In 1971, she was inducted into the
National Aviation Hall of Fame, “for outstanding contributions to aviation by
her devotion to the advancement of the role of women in all of its aspects, and
by establishing new performance records that advanced aeronautics.” In 1975,
she was the first woman to be honored with a permanent display of her
memorabilia at the United States Air Force Academy. Colonel Cochran
died

<p class="msonormal89">1.21.20.
<b class="calibre1">Airman First Class John Lee Levitow</b>.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.20.1. Airman Levitow, an AC-47 gunship
loadmaster, is the lowest ranking Airman ever to receive the Medal of Honor for
exceptional heroism during wartime. Born in Hartford, Connecticut, Levitow
attended Glastonbury High School. He was trained in the civil engineering
career field and later retrained into the loadmaster field. After flying on
C-130s out of McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, he was deployed to
Vietnam.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.20.2. On 24 February 1969, Airman
Levitow was handling Mark 24 magnesium flares aboard </p>

<p class="msonormal63">“Spooky 71” when his pilot threw the AC-47
and its eight-man crew into a turn to engage Viet Cong whose muzzle flashes
were visible outside the United States Army Depot at Long Binh. The aircraft,
an armed version of the C-47 Skytrain transport, had been flying a night
mission in the Tan Son Nhut air base area when Long Binh came under
attack.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.20.3. Suddenly, Spooky 71 was jarred by
a tremendous explosion and bathed in a blinding flash of light. A North
Vietnamese Army 82-millimeter mortar shell had landed on top of the right wing
and exploded inside the wing frame. The blast raked the fuselage with flying
shrapnel. Everyone in the back of Spooky 71 was wounded. Despite his wounds,
Levitow rescued a fellow crewmember who was perilously close to the open cargo
door. As he dragged his buddy toward the center of the cabin, Levitow saw a
loose, burning 27-pound magnesium flare rolling amid ammunition cans that
contained 19,000 live rounds.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.20.4. Through a haze of pain and shock,
Levitow, with 40 shrapnel wounds in his legs, side, and back, fighting a
30–degree bank, crawled to the flare, but was unable to grasp it to pick it up.
He threw himself on the burning flare, hugging it to his body, and dragged
himself to the rear of the aircraft, leaving a trail of blood behind. He hurled
it through the open cargo door, and at that instant, the flare separated and
ignited in the air, fortunately clear of the aircraft. When the aircraft
returned to the base, the extent of the danger was apparent: The AC-47 had more
than 3,500 holes in the wings and fuselage, one measuring more than three feet
long. Levitow spent 2 1/2 months in a hospital and upon his recovery, returned
to Vietnam for another tour. He returned to the United States to receive the
Medal of Honor from President Nixon during a 14 May 1970 Armed Forces Day
ceremony at the White House.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.20.5. Levitow was promoted to sergeant
before his honorable discharge four years later. On 22 January 1998, Air
Mobility Command struck a resounding chord with the Air Force enlisted corps
when it named a C-17 Globemaster II “The Spirit of John Levitow.”  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.20.6. Levitow designed veterans’
programs for the state of Connecticut until his 8 November 2000 death after a
lengthy battle with cancer. He was buried with military honors 17 November 2000
at Arlington National Cemetery.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.20.7. In his memory, the Levitow Honor
Graduate Award is presented to the top Air Force Airman Leadership School
graduate from each class. The Headquarters Building, 737th Training Group,
Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, was also dedicated in his honor. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.21.21.<b class="calibre1"> Staff Sergeant William H. Pitsenbarger</b>.<b class="calibre1"> </b>On
11 April 1966, a 21-year-old known as “Pits” to his friends was killed while
defending wounded comrades. For his bravery and sacrifice, Pararescueman
Pitsenbarger was posthumously awarded the nation’s highest military
decorations: the Medal of Honor and the Air Force Cross. He was the first
enlisted Airman to receive both medals posthumously.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.21.1. Pitsenbarger was born in 1945 and
grew up in Piqua, Ohio, a small town near Dayton. He joined the Air Force on
New Year’s Eve 1962 and after pararescue training in 1965, reported to
Detachment 6, 38th Air Rescue and Recovery Squadron, Bien Hoa Air Base, near
Saigon, Republic of South Vietnam. His unit, composed of five aircrews, flew
three HH-43F Kaman “Huskie” helicopters. His commander, Major Maurice Kessler,
referred to Pitsenbarger as “one of a special breed; alert and always ready to
go on any mission.” Pitsenbarger flew almost 300 rescue missions in Vietnam,
routinely risking his life to rescue downed soldiers and Airmen.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.21.2. On 11 April 1966, Airman
Pitsenbarger was aboard a rescue helicopter responding to a call to evacuate
casualties from an ongoing firefight approximately 35 miles east of Saigon.
When he arrived at the site, he descended from the helicopter to organize and
coordinate rescue efforts, care for the wounded, prepare casualties for
evacuation, and insure the recovery operation was smooth and orderly. Several
times he refused to evacuate.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.21.3. Rescue helicopters transported
wounded to an aid station, returning to evacuate more injured. One helicopter
was hit by enemy fire as it lowered a litter basket to Pitsenbarger. When its
engine began to lose power, the pilot realized he had to get it away from the
area. Pitsenbarger chose to remain with the Army troops on the ground, waving
off the helicopter. Because of the heavy mortar and small-arms fire, the
helicopters couldn’t return to the site.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.21.4. As the battle raged, Pitsenbarger
repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire in order to pull wounded to safety and
care for them, returning fire when possible. During the fight, he was wounded
three times. When others ran low on ammunition, he gathered ammo clips from the
dead and distributed them to the living. Having administered aid, he picked up
a rifle, joining the soldiers to help hold off the Viet Cong. Pitsenbarger was
killed by Viet Cong snipers later that night. When his body was recovered the next
day, one hand still held a rifle and the other clutched a medical kit.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.21.5. Although Pitsenbarger didn’t
escape alive, nine men did, thanks to his courage and devotion to duty. On 8
December 2000, Pitsenbarger’s parents, William and Alice, accepted the Medal of
Honor from Secretary of the Air Force Whit Peters. The audience included battle
survivors, hundreds of pararescue airmen, a Congressional representative, and
the Air Force Chief of Staff. Pitsenbarger was posthumously promoted to staff sergeant,
and the Navy named an Air Force munitions preposition ship the “MV A1C William
H. Pitsenbarger” in his honor. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">1.21.22. <b class="calibre1">Colonel
Eileen M. Collins</b>. Colonel Collins was the first woman to command a space
shuttle mission. An Air Force officer and National Aeronautics and Space
Administration astronaut, Colonel Collins was born 19 November 1956, in Elmira,
New York. She earned a bachelor of arts degree in mathematics and economics at
Syracuse University in 1978; a master of science degree in operations research
from Stanford University in 1986; and a master of arts degree in space systems
management from Webster University in 1989. Collins graduated from Air Force
Undergraduate Pilot Training at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma, in 1979, served
as a T-38 instructor pilot at Vance, and in 1983 became a C-141 aircraft
commander and instructor pilot at Travis Air Force Base, California. From 1986
to 1989, she was an assistant professor of mathematics and a T-41 instructor
pilot at the United States Air Force Academy. By the time she retired from the
Air Force in 2005, Colonel Collins logged more than 6,750 hours in 30 different
types of aircraft.</p>

<p class="msonormal12">  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.22.1. In January 1990, National Aeronautics
and Space Administration selected Colonel Collins for the astronaut program
while she was attending the Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force
Base, California. She became an astronaut in July 1991, initially assigned to
orbiter engineering support. She served on the astronaut support team
responsible for orbiter prelaunch checkout, final launch configuration, crew
ingress/egress, and landing/recovery, and also worked as a mission control
spacecraft communicator. She also served as the astronaut office spacecraft
systems branch chief, chief information officer, shuttle branch chief, and
astronaut safety branch chief.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.22.2. A veteran of four space flights,
Collins logged over 872 hours in space. STS-63 was the first flight of the new
joint Russian-American Space Program. Mission highlights included the
rendezvous with the Russian Space Station Mir, an astronomy shuttle deployment
and retrieval, and a space-walk. On this mission, Colonel Collins became the
first female pilot of a space shuttle.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.22.3. She flew on STS-84 aboard the
Atlantis 15-24 May 1997. It was National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s
sixth Shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station
Mir. During the flight, the crew transferred nearly four tons of supplies and
experimental equipment.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.22.4. During STS-93, flown by the
Columbia, 22-27 July 1999, she became the first woman to command a shuttle
mission. This mission featured deployment of the Chandra X-Ray
Observatory.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.22.5. STS -114 Discovery, 26 July-9
August 2005, was the return to flight mission during which the shuttle docked
with the International Space Station and the crew tested and evaluated new
procedures for flight safety and shuttle inspection and repair techniques.
After a two-week, 5.8 million-mile-journey in space, the orbiter and its
seven-astronaut crew returned, landing at Edwards Air Force Base,
California.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.22.6. Colonel Collins retired from
National Aeronautics and Space Administration in May 2006. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">1.21.23. <b class="calibre1">Senior Airman Jason D. Cunningham</b>. Born 27
March 1975, Senior Airman Cunningham earned the Air Force Cross for
extraordinary heroism in military operations, presented posthumously by the
President of the United States, against an opposing armed force while serving
as a pararescueman near the village of Marzak, Paktia Province,
Afghanistan,      4 March 2002.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.23.1. That day, Senior Airman Cunningham
was the primary Air Force combat search and rescue medic assigned to a quick
reaction force that had been tasked to rescue two American servicemen from
austere terrain occupied by Al Qaeda and Taliban forces.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.23.2. Shortly before landing, his MH-47E
helicopter took rocket-propelled grenade and small arms fire, severely
disabling the aircraft. The assault force formed a hasty defense and
immediately suffered three fatalities and five critical casualties.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.23.3. Facing enemy fire, risking his own
life, Senior Airman Cunningham remained in the burning fuselage in order to
treat the wounded. He moved his patients to a more secure location under mortar
attack, disregarding the extreme danger, exposing himself to enemy fire on
seven separate occasions.  </p>

<p class="msonormal63">1.21.23.4. When the second casualty
collection point was also compromised, Senior Airman Cunningham braved intense
small arms and rocket-propelled grenade attack to reposition the wounded to a
third collection point. Mortally wounded and quickly fading, he continued to direct
patient movement, transferring care to another medic. His selfless efforts
resulted to the delivery of ten gravely wounded Americans to life-saving
medical treatment. </p>

<p class="msonormal69">1.21.24. <b class="calibre1">Chief Master Sergeant Richard L.
Etchberger</b>. Born in 1933, Richard Loy “Dick” Etchberger grew up in
Pennsylvania, joining the Air Force in 1951. After completing basic training,
he attended a technical school at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi, studying
electronics, which would launch his career in radar bomb scoring. One of the
Air Force’s most highly trained radar technicians, he volunteered for a highly
classified mission at Lima Site 85 in Laos. He was the crew chief of a radar
team there when North Vietnamese forces overran his radar
site          11 March 1968. Under
heavy fire, he continued to defend his comrades, called in air strikes, and
directed an air evacuation. When a rescue helicopter arrived, the chief put
himself in the line of fire to load three other Airmen in rescue slings. He was
fatally wounded by enemy ground fire as he was being rescued. His fierce
defense prevented the enemy from closing on his position, which saved his
comrades lives, although he lost his own. For extraordinary heroism and superb
leadership, Chief Etchberger was posthumously awarded the Air Force Cross, but
the award remained a secret for two decades. He was awarded the Medal of Honor
on 21 September 2010, the first E-9 to receive this award. </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre1">WING SUPPORT </b></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 16A—Overview </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.1. Introduction.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal4">Wing Support is filled with information every
Airman can use on a daily basis to assist them along in their career. Air Force
Portal, entitlements, legal services, ground safety along with risk management,
and the procedures for prevention of and response to sexual assault are some of
the topics covered. The chapter serves as a great guide to assist you if you
shall ever need information on any of these topics. More importantly though, as
you become supervisor, mentor or friend having a working knowledge of topics
covered in this chapter is vital to helping you be a great Wingman. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 16B—Air Force Portal </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.2. Air Force Portal
Simplifies Access: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">16.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>In
2000, the United States Air Force launched the Air Force Portal to simplify
access to information. The mission of the Air Force Portal is to provide ready
access to the latest Air Force information, services, and combat support
applications. Since first introduced, the Air Force Portal has changed the way
we do business. Every day this technology helps us connect, collaborate, and
perform our duties in service to our nation. Access is available anytime,
anywhere, from any Internet-connected computer whether at home, at the office,
or deployed with a valid Department of Defense public key infrastructure
certificate, such as a common access card. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">16.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>The Air
Force Portal provides a single point of entry to Web-based information,
self-service applications, collaboration and networking tools, and combat
support systems, many without requiring a separate user identification and
password. Users have access to key applications like total force awareness
training, myPay, Air Force virtual education center, Air Force fitness
management system, virtual military personnel flight, LeaveWeb, Training
Business Area, Enterprise-Solution-Supply and many more. On the library page,
you can access online periodicals, do research, and find valuable education and
training materials. The Portal is the entry point to the Global Combat Support
System Air Force. The goal of Global Combat Support System Air Force is to
provide timely, accurate, and trusted combat support information to joint and
Air Force commanders at all echelons. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">16.2.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Tremendous
growth continues, with the number of active registered Air Force and Department
of Defense users now over 725,000, with over 400,000 average logins per week,
and serving millions of web pages per day. Provides one location for all
areas—information, collaboration, and applications—so you can do your job,
manage your career, and live your life in the Air Force.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 16C—Military Pay,
Allowances, and Entitlements </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.3. Military Pay and
Allowances. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal8">Department of Defense 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, <i class="calibre2">Military Pay Policy—Active Duty and Reserve
Pay, </i>The Joint Travel Regulation and Air Force Manual 65-116, Volume 1, <i class="calibre2">Defense Joint Military Pay System Active
Component FSO Procedures</i>, contain guidance on pay and allowances and
related entitlements. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Military
(Basic) Pay: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">16.3.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Basic
pay is the fundamental component of military pay and typically, the largest
component of a member’s pay. Every member is entitled to basic pay while on
Regular Air Force, with some exceptions such as: during periods of unauthorized
absence, excess leave, or after an enlistment expires. Annual military pay
raises are set by Congress and the President in the National Defense
Authorization Act. In accordance with Federal Law (37 United States Code 1009)
the January 1 annual pay raise will automatically match the private sector wage
increases, as measured by the Employment Cost Index for the previous year. If,
because of national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the
general welfare, the President may submit a plan to Congress requesting a lower
annual pay raise. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">16.3.1.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Grade
and length of military service determine the actual rate of basic pay. Military
pay date is important because this date determines the length of service for
pay purposes. In general, the pay date should be the same date the individual
entered on Regular Air Force if he or she had no prior service before entering
the Air Force. However, if the individual previously served in certain
governmental agencies the Air Force adjusts the pay date to reflect credit for
these periods. Periods of absence without leave, desertion, and sickness or
injury due to personal misconduct will result in negative pay date adjustments.
</p>

<p class="msonormal12"><span class="calibre3"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> Leave and
Earnings Statement. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal13">Defense Finance and Accounting Service Form 702, <i class="calibre2">Defense Finance and Accounting Service
Military Leave and Earnings Statement</i>, is a comprehensive statement of a
member’s entitlements, deductions, allotments, leave information,
tax-withholding information, and Traditional Thrift Savings Plan and the Roth
Thrift Savings Plan information. Verify and keep your leave and earnings
statement each month with increased attention when returning from deployment or
when making changes such as marriage, divorce, or birth of a child. If your pay
varies significantly and you don’t understand why or if you have any questions,
consult your servicing finance office. The myPay system allows members to view
their leave and earnings statement as well as initiate changes to selected
items affecting their pay. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.4. Military
Allowances and Entitlements. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal14">Allowances are monies provided for specific needs
such as food or housing. Monetary allowances are provided when the government
does not provide for that specific need. For example, the quantity of
government housing is not sufficient to house all military members and their
families. Those who live in government housing do not receive full housing
allowances. Those who do not live in government housing receive allowances to
assist with the cost of obtaining commercial housing. The most common
allowances are basic allowance for subsistence and basic allowance for housing.
Most members receive both of these allowances, and in many cases, these
allowances comprise a significant portion of the member’s total pay. Other than
continental United States cost-of-living allowance, allowances are not taxable,
which is an additional embedded benefit of military pay. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.4.1.<b class="calibre1"> Basic
Allowance for Subsistence.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Basic allowance for subsistence is a nontaxable
allowance used to offset the cost of the service member’s meals. Most junior
grade enlisted members assigned to single-type government quarters at their
permanent duty station are required to eat in the government dining facilities,
receive basic allowance for subsistence, and are charged the discounted meal
rate which is deducted from their pay. When certified by the commanding officer
or designee, members are allowed to claim reimbursement for missed meals. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">16.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> Housing Allowances. </b>Housing allowances are based on member’s
grade, dependency status, and duty location. The location determines whether
the allowance is basic allowance for housing or overseas housing allowance. In
some cases, members who are not able to take their families to the permanent
duty station are eligible for payment of family separation housing allowance in
addition to basic allowance for housing or overseas housing allowance. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">16.4.2.1.<b class="calibre1">
Basic Allowance for Housing.</b> The intent of basic allowance for housing is
to provide uniformed service members accurate and equitable housing
compensation based on housing costs in local civilian housing markets. This
allowance is payable when government quarters are not provided. Many Air Force
installations have privatized their quarters, meaning that private contractors
have taken over much of the previously Air Force-owned-andoperated family
housing. Members in these privatized quarters are entitled to basic allowance
for housing, and the rental agreement requires a rent amount not to exceed the
basic allowance for housing entitlement paid via allotment. Members without
dependents residing in government single-type quarters are entitled to partial
basic allowance for housing unless the quarters (including government-leased
quarters) exceed the minimum standards of single quarters for their grade.
Members living in single-type government quarters who pay court-ordered child
support may qualify for differential (basic allowance for
housing-Differential). The leave and earning statement displays the basic
allowance for housing rate below the heading ENTITLEMENTS, listed as basic
allowance for housing. The PAY DATA portion of the leave and earning statement
shows the basic allowance for housing type and basic allowance for housing dependents,
as well as other housing-related data. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">16.4.2.2.<b class="calibre1">
Overseas Housing Allowance.</b> Overseas housing allowance is a cost
reimbursement-based allowance to help defray housing costs incident to
assignments to a permanent duty station outside the United States. Members are
reimbursed actual rental costs not to exceed the maximum overseas housing
allowance rate for each locality, grade, and dependency status. There are two
types of allowances paid under overseas housing allowance: move-in housing
allowance and monthly overseas housing allowance including a utility/recurring
maintenance allowance. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">The location move-in housing allowance (for those
who qualify) is based on the average “move-in” costs for members. The monthly
overseas housing allowance is the rent, up to the rental allowance at a
permanent duty station, plus the utility/recurring maintenance allowance. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">16.4.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Family
Separation Housing.</b> The purpose of family separation housing is to pay a
member for added housing expenses resulting from enforced separation from
dependents. There are two types of family separation housing: family separation
housing –basic allowance for housing and family separation housing-overseas
housing allowance. Family separation housing –basic allowance for housing is payable
in a monthly amount equal to the without-dependent basic allowance for housing
rate applicable to the member’s grade and permanent duty station. Family
separation housing-overseas housing allowance is payable in a monthly amount up
to the without-dependent overseas housing allowance rate applicable to the
member’s grade and permanent duty station. For additional guidance, consult the
Joint Travel Regulation at <a href="http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/travelreg.cfm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre4">http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/travelreg.cfm</span></a><a href="http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/travelreg.cfm" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">.</span></a> </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.4.3.<b class="calibre1"> Clothing
Replacement Allowance. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">Enlisted military members receive an annual
allowance to help maintain, repair, and replace initial issue uniform items as
necessary. There are two types of clothing replacement allowance: clothing
replacement allowance Basic, a preliminary replacement allowance paid annually
between the 6th and 36th month of Regular Air Force; and clothing replacement
allowance Standard, an allowance that automatically replaces clothing
replacement allowance Basic after 36 months of Regular Air Force. Entitlement
to either allowance depends on the individual’s “entered on Regular Air Force
date” in his or her master military pay account. This allowance is paid at the
end of the member’s anniversary month and appears on the leave and earning
statement opposite CLOTHING under the ENTITLEMENTS heading. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.4.4.<b class="calibre1"> Family
Separation Allowance. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">Family separation allowance is a type of allowance
payable to members with dependents in addition to any other allowance or per
diem to which a member may be entitled. Family separation allowance has three
different categories: family separation allowance-restricted, family separation
allowance-serving on ships, and family separation allowance-temporary. A member
may not receive more than one payment of family separation allowance for the
same period, even though qualified for family separation allowance-restricted
and family separation allowance-serving on ships or family separation
allowance-temporary. The purpose of family separation allowance is to
compensate qualified members for added expenses incurred because of an enforced
family separation. Members are eligible for family separation allowance-restricted
if transportation of dependents, including dependents acquired after effective
date of orders, is not authorized at government expense, and the dependents do
not live in the vicinity of the member’s permanent duty station. Family
separation allowance-serving on ships applies to members serving on ships away
from the homeport continuously for more than 30 days. A member is eligible for
family separation allowance-temporary if the member is on temporary duty away
from the permanent station continuously for more than 30 days, and the member’s
dependents are not residing at or near the temporary duty station. This
includes members required to perform a period of the temporary duty before
reporting to their initial station of assignment. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.4.5.<b class="calibre1"> Station
Allowances outside the Continental United States. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal13">The aim of overseas station allowances is to help
defray the higher than normal cost of living or cost in procuring housing in
overseas areas. Allowances the Department of Defense authorizes only at certain
overseas locations include temporary lodging allowance and cost-of-living
allowance. Members receive information regarding their specific entitlements
during in-processing at the new location. Members may also receive information
from their local finance office upon notification of a pending overseas
assignment. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">16.4.6. <b class="calibre1">Continental
United States Cost-of-Living Allowance.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal20">Continental Unites States cost-of-living allowance is
payable to members assigned to designated “high cost” areas within the continental
Unites States. For additional information, see Joint Travel Regulation, chapter
8.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.5. Special and
Incentive Pay. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal21">A number of special and incentive pays recognize
certain aspects of duty, including, but not limited to hazardous duty incentive
pay, imminent danger pay, special duty assignment pay, enlisted flying duty
incentive pay, and hardship duty pay-location. Also included are enlistment and
reenlistment bonuses. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.6. Deductions. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal22">The two general categories of payroll deductions are involuntary
and voluntary deductions. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.6.1.<b class="calibre1"> Involuntary
Deductions: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal23">16.6.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> Withholding
Income Tax: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">16.6.1.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Department
of Defense 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Chapter 44, outlines specific taxable and
nontaxable items. All “pay” is considered income for federal and state income
tax purposes (for example, basic pay, incentive pay, special pay, lump-sum
payment of accrued leave, and separation pay). Allowances considered nontaxable
on 9 September 1986 remain nontaxable. For example, basic allowance for subsistence
remains nontaxable and continental United States cost-of-living allowance is
taxable. </p>

<p class="msonormal25">16.6.1.1.2. The leave and earning statement reflects the
current month and year-to-date income for social security, federal income tax,
and state income tax purposes under the headings “FICA TAXES,” “FED TAXES,” and
“STATE TAXES” in the middle of the form. Defense Finance and Accounting Service
is responsible for ensuring the leave and earning statement provides the
necessary pay and entitlement information. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">16.6.1.2.<b class="calibre1">
Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) Taxes. </b>The FICA requires federal
agencies to withhold FICA (Social Security and Medicare) taxes from the basic
pay of military members covered by the Social Security Act and to pay matching
FICA taxes to the Social Security Administration. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">16.6.1.3.<b class="calibre1">
Federal Income Tax Withholding (FITW). </b>FITW is used to provide for national
programs such as defense, community development, and law enforcement. The FITW
complies with the Treasury Department Circular E as implemented in military
service directives. A member may authorize an additional monthly amount of
FITW. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">16.6.1.4.<b class="calibre1">
State Income Tax Withholding (SITW). </b>The tax laws of the state where the
member is a legal resident determine whether the member must pay state taxes.
The amount withheld depends upon the state tax rate. Onetime payments may also
be subject to state tax. The state for tax purposes is reflected in the first
column on the leave and earning statement under STATE TAXES. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">16.6.1.5.<b class="calibre1">
Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH). </b>Monthly deductions from the pay of
regular enlisted members, up to a maximum of $1, are set by the Secretary of
Defense after consulting with the AFRH Board. The money helps support the
United States Soldiers’, Airmen’s and Naval Homes. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.6.2.<b class="calibre1"> Voluntary
Deductions: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal26">16.6.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Military
members may establish voluntary deductions such as allotments to help
administer their personal finances. Effective January 1, 2015, members are not
authorized to start allotments for the purchase, lease, or rental of personal
property. Personal property includes vehicles (e.g., automobiles, motorcycles,
or boats), appliances or household goods (e.g., a washer, dryer, furniture),
electronics (e.g., laptop, tablet, cellphone, or television), and other
consumer items that are tangible and movable. Members may also have an
allotment for a personal savings program, support of family members, and
payment of insurance premiums. Members may control certain discretionary
allotments through myPay however, there can be no more than one discretionary
allotment to the same allottee. Nondiscretionary allotments have limited uses,
such as charitable contributions, loan repayment to the Air Force Aid Society,
garnishment for commercial debts, and delinquent travel charge card debt. </p>

<p class="msonormal27">16.6.2.2. To allow for sufficient processing time, allotments
should be requested about 30 days before the desired month. Occasionally, an
allotment transaction may occur after the cutoff date for the mid-month payday.
This will result in the entire amount of the allotment being deducted from the
end-of-month pay. Normally, if the member is paid twice a month, the allotment
is deducted in equal amounts from the mid-month and end-of-month pay. If the
individual receives pay once a month, the entire amount is deducted from the
monthly paycheck. There are certain cutoff dates that affect when allotments
can be processed. Contact your local finance office for assistance. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">16.6.2.3. The maximum amount of service members’
Group Life Insurance coverage is $400,000 and members are covered, by law, at
the maximum rate unless they decline or reduce coverage. Service members’ Group
Life Insurance automatically insures an eligible member against death when the
member is performing Regular Air Force or Regular Air Force for training for an
ordered period of more than 30 days. However, an individual may choose less
coverage in amounts divisible by $50,000 or elect no coverage, but he or she
must do so in writing. Additionally, family service members’ Group Life
Insurance covers spouses and dependent children when the eligible member also
participates in Service members’ Group Life Insurance coverage, including
military spouses. There is a monthly deduction for spousal coverage: the amount
of the deduction depends on the amount of coverage. Each child is covered in
the amount of $10,000 at no cost to the member. The member may not elect to
insure any child for less than $10,000. Service members’ Group Life Insurance
and Family service members’ Group Life Insurance premiums are deducted from
members’ military pay each month. The military personnel section is the office
of primary responsibility for administering the program. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.7. Military Pay
Schedules: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.7.1. <b class="calibre1">Regular
Payments. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">Military members are paid on a monthly basis with
the option to receive payments once or twice per month. Members receive a
statement (net pay advice) of the net amount pay and the financial organization
to which statement was sent at mid-month (if receiving a payment) and a
comprehensive statement of pay, the leave and earning statement, at the end of
the month via myPay. These statements are created centrally by Defense Finance
and Accounting Service. Military members must understand the pay system has
processing cutoff dates that affect updates to their pay. The cutoff date is the
day when Defense Finance and Accounting Service stops processing transactions
against pay accounts for the current period so the regular payroll process can
begin. The cutoff is necessary to compute, prepare, and transfer funds. While
the cutoff dates fluctuate from month to month, they are generally around the
6th for the mid-month payday and the 20th for the end-of-month payday. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.7.2.<b class="calibre1"> Local,
Partial, and Emergency Partial Payments. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">Local cash payments are normally only authorized
for overseas areas where on base military banking facilities are not readily
available. Exceptions may be granted for members assigned to classified or
contingency operations where the exigencies of their assignments may require
local cash or partial payments. Under extenuating circumstances, a stateside
member may receive an emergency partial payment if the payment is deemed time
sensitive and required within 24 hours due to an unforeseen set of
circumstances. The member’s commander may authorize immediate cash payments up to
the amount of accrued entitlement to date when deemed appropriate to the
mission. Non-cash partial payments may be made, via electronic funds transfer
and deposited into the member’s financial institution, normally in 2 to 3
business days. Partial payments are limited to the amount of pay and allowances
the member has accrued to the date of the payment. Partial payments are
recouped in full on the next available payday. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.7.3.<b class="calibre1"> Permanent
Change of Station Advance Payments. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">Advance payments of pay and allowances provide
members with funds to meet extraordinary expenses incident to a
government-ordered relocation that are directly related to the permanent change
of station and not covered by other entitlements. A permanent change of station
advance payment is an advance of up to 3 months of basic pay, less the
mandatory deductions of FICA, FITW, SITW, Air Force Retirement Home, and all
known debts currently being deducted. Airman First Class and below must have
the approval of their immediate commander for advance pay. If the desired
repayment period is greater than 12 months or the amount requested is greater
than 1 month’s basic pay, then all members must have the approval of their
immediate commander. Repayment periods greater than 12 months are only approved
in cases of financial hardship. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b>
Individual billed account government travel charge card usage is authorized and
highly encouraged for all permanent change of station related expenses. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.8. Permanent Change
of Station Allowances: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.8.1.<b class="calibre1"> Transportation
Allowance. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal20">When military members are ordered to perform a permanent
change of station, they may receive a variety of travel allowances. Some of
these allowances include: </p>

<p class="msonormal25">16.8.1.1.<b class="calibre1">
Government-Procured Transportation. </b>Available United States-certificated
air carriers must be used for all commercial air transportation of
persons/property when the government funds the air travel. When the
authorizing/order-issuing official determines United States-certificated air
carriers are unavailable, commercial air transportation on a non-United
States-certificated air carrier may be authorized/approved. Documentation
explaining why United States-certificated air carrier service is not available
must be provided to the traveler. Endorsements on the travel orders or
government travel procurement document made in accordance with service guidance
are acceptable. Travel time for travel by government conveyance (except
government automobile) or common carriers obtained by government-procured
transportation is allowed for the actual time needed to travel over the direct
route including necessary delays for the transportation mode used. </p>

<p class="msonormal25">16.8.1.2.<b class="calibre1"> Use of
Privately Owned Conveyance. </b>Uniformed service policy is to
authorize/approve (as distinguished from permit) privately owned conveyance
travel if acceptable to the member and advantageous to the government based on
the facts in each case. Other allowable travel and transportation options
include government conveyance or commercial carrier. Reimbursement of parking
fees, ferry fares, road, bridge and tunnel tolls is authorized for privately
owned conveyance over the most direct route between the stations involved. The
member is also authorized a flat per diem at the standard continental United States
rate for each permanent change of station travel day between authorized points,
up to the allowable travel time. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">16.8.1.3.<b class="calibre1">
Personally Procured Transportation. </b>Department of Defense policy mandates
the use of the commercial travel office for all official transportation
requirements. A member who, despite the Department of Defense policy, procures
common carrier transportation at personal expense for official travel is
authorized reimbursement (except transoceanic travel in which no reimbursement
is authorized) up to the amount authorized. However, reimbursement must not
exceed the cost for the authorized transportation and accommodations over a
usually traveled direct route according to a schedule necessary to meet the
requirements of the order. Commands/units are expected to take appropriate
disciplinary action when a member and (or) an authorizing/order-issuing
official fail to follow the regulations concerning commercial travel office
use. Consult the Joint Travel Regulation for additional information. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">16.8.1.4.<b class="calibre1">
Mixed Modes.</b> When both government-procured and personally procured modes of
transportation are used, the Air Force uses a combination of rules governed by
the Joint Travel Regulation. The local Financial Service Office can provide
specific guidance. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.8.2.<b class="calibre1"> Dependent
Travel. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">A military member receives monetary allowance in
lieu of transportation and flat rate per diem for the official distance
dependents travel with him or her by privately owned vehicle. If dependents
purchase commercial common carrier transportation, the member may be reimbursed
for the actual cost of the transportation, not to exceed the cost the
government would have incurred for ordered travel, and the member receives a
per diem allowance for dependents. When the Air Force restricts travel of
dependents to a location overseas, dependents may move at government expense to
any place (called the Designated Location, which must be approved and listed on
the permanent change of station authorization) within the continental United
States the member designates. With special approval, dependents may move
outside the continental United States. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.8.3.<b class="calibre1"> Dislocation
Allowance<i class="calibre2">. </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal26">This allowance is paid at a rate determined by the
Secretary of Defense and payable to all members with dependents when dependents
relocate their household goods in conjunction with a permanent change of
station. It is also payable to members without dependents if they are not
assigned permanent government quarters upon arrival at the new permanent duty
station. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.8.4.<b class="calibre1"> Temporary
Lodging Expense and Temporary Lodging Allowance.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal24">A member arriving or departing permanent change of
station at a location within the continental United States may receive
temporary lodging expense<b class="calibre1"> </b>to help
defray the added living expenses incurred while occupying temporary lodging. A
member arriving or departing permanent change of station at a location outside
the continental United States may receive temporary lodging allowance<b class="calibre1"> </b>to help defray the added living
expenses incurred while occupying temporary lodging. Temporary lodging expense
is paid on a travel voucher. Temporary lodging allowance is paid in military
pay and is reflected on the leave and earning statement. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.8.5.<b class="calibre1"> Shipment of
Household Goods. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">A member ordered on a permanent change of station
move may ship household goods<b class="calibre1"> </b>within
certain weight limitations at government expense. Authorized weight allowances
normally depend on the grade of the member and whether he or she has
dependents. A member may be reimbursed for personally arranging for the
shipment of household goods. Claims should be prepared and submitted according
to service instructions. The government’s cost limit is based on the member’s
maximum household goods weight allowance (that is, if the member transports
household goods in excess of the authorized weight allowance, all payments are
based on the authorized weight allowance). </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.8.6.<b class="calibre1"> Shipment of
Unaccompanied Baggage. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">This provision refers to the portion of the
permanent change of station weight allowance ordinarily transported separately
from the major or bulk of household goods and usually is transported by an
expedited mode. When the expedited transportation mode is commercial air, a
maximum of 1,000 pounds (net), may be transported. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.8.7.<b class="calibre1"> Shipment of
Privately Owned Vehicle. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal25">When authorized, members may ship one privately owned
vehicle at government expense when ordered to go on a permanent change of
station to, from, or between locations overseas. Privately owned vehicle
storage may be provided or authorized for personally arranging when shipment is
prohibited or restricted. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.8.8.<b class="calibre1"> Mobile Home
Shipment. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal29">Members who own a mobile home should contact the
traffic management office to arrange transportation. In certain circumstances,
members may arrange or contract personally for the movement of the mobile home.
Shipment of a mobile home is in lieu of household goods transportation. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.9. Temporary Duty
Entitlements: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.9.1.<b class="calibre1"> Per Diem. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">This allowance helps defray the cost of quarters,
meals, and certain incidentals, Per diem rates depend on the temporary duty
location. Travelers are paid a prescribed amount for meals and incidental
expenses plus the actual amount for lodging, not to exceed the maximum lodging
rate for the specific location. The rates depend on the availability of
government facilities, such as quarters and dining facilities. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.9.2.<b class="calibre1"> Transportation<i class="calibre2">. </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal30">Policy mandates that uniformed
service members use available commercial travel offices to arrange official
travel. The mode of transportation used between the points designated in the
travel order will determine the transportation entitlement. On the other hand,
if the member receives authorization to travel at personal expense, he or she
will receive a reimbursement limited to what cost the government would have
incurred for the authorized mode of travel. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">Consult the transportation office or commercial travel
office for assistance. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.9.3.<b class="calibre1"> Miscellaneous
Reimbursable Expenses. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal29">Reimbursable travel related expenses include travel
from home or place of lodging to the servicing transportation terminal by taxi,
limousine, bus, or privately owned vehicle; passports, and visas; and rental
vehicles when authorized on travel orders. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.9.4.<b class="calibre1"> Temporary Duty
Expenses: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal31">16.9.4.1. When the temporary duty is completed, the
traveler is responsible for electronically filing a voucher (Defense Travel
System) or preparing his or her DD Form 1351-2, <i class="calibre2">Travel Voucher or Subvoucher</i>,<i class="calibre2">
</i>to claim reimbursement for official travel within 5 business days upon
return to permanent duty station. The traveler is responsible for the truth and
accuracy of the information. When the traveler signs the form (and this
signature authority must never be delegated), he or she attests that the
statements are true and complete and that he or she is aware of the liability
for filing a false claim. All claims and attached statements shall be completed
using ink, typewriter, or computer-generated forms. The member is expected to
pay the amount billed from the government travel charge card company upon
receipt of the monthly statement. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">16.9.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Electronic
funds transfer is the mandatory means by which a travel claim is settled. The
split disbursement option in Defense Travel System, which permits direct
payment via electronic funds transfer to the government travel charge card
contractor for charges incurred on the individual billed account government
travel charge card and to the cardholder for any residual amount will be utilized.
Spilt disbursement enables travelers to elect the amount of money to be
forwarded to the government travel charge card contractor. In cases where the
traveler is temporary duty for 45 days or more, he or she shall file an interim
voucher (or have scheduled partial payments setup in Defense Travel System)
every 30 days and use split disbursement to pay the bill. An extended temporary
duty trip is no excuse for late payment of the government travel charge card
bill. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.10. The Government
Travel Charge Card Program: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.10.1.<b class="calibre1"> Purpose. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal32">The travel card program is intended to facilitate
and standardize the use by Department of Defense travelers of a safe,
effective, convenient, commercially available method to pay for expenses
incident to official travel, including local travel. The travel card is used to
improve Department of Defense cash management, reduce Department of Defense and
traveler administrative workloads, and facilitate better service to Department
of Defense travelers. In addition, because of the refund feature of the travel
card program, the program results in cost savings for the Department. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.10.2.<b class="calibre1"> Agency
Program Coordinators. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">An agency program coordinator is an individual
(uniformed member, employee, contractor, or foreign national) designated in
writing by a commander or director as responsible for the management of the
travel card program. Agency program coordinators are responsible to manage the
travel card program within their hierarchy in accordance with Department of
Defense Financial Management Regulation, Volume 9, Chapter 3 and understand
policies and procedures set forth in the Air Force government travel charge
card guide, and the Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.10.3.<b class="calibre1"> Card Use. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">Unless otherwise exempted, all Department of
Defense personnel are required to use the government-sponsored,
contractor-issued government travel charge card for all expenses arising from
official government travel. These expenses include lodging, transportation
expenses, local ground transportation, and rental car expenses authorized on
travel orders. The cardholder, while in a travel status, may use the card for
nonreimbursable incidental travel expenses such as rental movies, personal
telephone calls, exercise fees, and beverages when these charges are not part
of a separate room billing or meal and are reasonable. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">16.10.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Government
travel charge cardholders obtain cash, as authorized, through automated teller
machines, rather than obtaining cash advances from a Department of Defense
disbursing officer. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">16.10.3.2. Travelers may use the government travel
charge card at a specified network of automated teller machine to obtain cash
needed to pay for “out-of-pocket” travel-related expenses. The travel card
vendor assigns a personal identification number to each cardholder, together
with card issuance to permit automated teller machine access. Automated teller
machine advances will not be obtained earlier than 3 working days before
scheduled travel and are limited to authorized expenses exempt from mandatory
card usage (meals, incidentals, miscellaneous expenses, etc.). The travel card
vendor will charge the cardholder a transaction fee for automated teller
machine use. This includes international transaction fees made as a result of
any foreign currency conversion. These charges, which appear on the
cardholder’s billing statement, are typically part of the incidental expense
portion of per diem and are therefore no longer separate reimbursable expenses.
In addition, some banks charge a service fee for automated teller machine
access. This fee is also part of the incidental expense portion of per diem and
are no longer reimbursable. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.10.4.<b class="calibre1"> Card Abuse<i class="calibre2">. </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">Commanders or supervisors will not tolerate the
misuse of the Department of Defense government travel charge card. Cardholders
who misuse their Department of Defense government travel charge card are
subject to appropriate administrative or disciplinary action. The cardholder
will only use the government travel charge card while in official travel
status. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.10.5.<b class="calibre1"> How to Pay
the Card Company<i class="calibre2">. </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">The travel card vendor provides detailed monthly
bills. Cardholders are responsible for payment in full of outstanding balances
due in the monthly billing statement from the travel card vendor. Payments
should be made promptly (within the current billing cycle). Military service
members who travel temporary duty and use government credit cards must use the
split disbursement feature within Defense Travel System, which automatically
pays the credit card vendor for credit card charges while on official travel.
Cardholders must designate the total outstanding balance incurred while
traveling as split-disbursement when filing their vouchers. A late fee per
billing cycle may be assessed for individually billed accounts that are 75 days
past the closing date of the account statement on which the charges first
appeared. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.10.6.<b class="calibre1"> Travel Card
Considerations during a Permanent Change of Station. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Individuals are required to use the government
travel charge card during a permanent change of station. Credit limit increases
and deferred payment options are available to accommodate the extended travel
times of a permanent change of station move. The individual is still
responsible for keeping the bill current while in a permanent change of station
status. The cardholder must notify the losing agency program coordinator before
departing the old duty station and gaining agency program coordinator upon
reporting to the new duty station. The losing agency program coordinator will
update the travel card account to “mission critical” status and set a future
date in the travel card company’s Electronic Access System to deactivate the
cardholder’s account based on permanent change of station travel order report
no later than date. The agency program coordinator will also submit a transfer
request to the travel card vendor so the individual is removed from that unit’s
reporting hierarchy level. The gaining agency program coordinator will ensure
the transfer request is processed by the travel card vendor when the member
arrives so the account information can be updated. The gaining agency program
coordinator will also clear the deactivation date within the travel card
vendor’s Electronic Access System.<span class="calibre3">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.10.7.<b class="calibre1">
Delinquencies: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal33">16.10.7.1. Cardholders are responsible for payment
in full of the amount stated on the monthly billing statement. The travel card
vendor will submit to Defense Finance and Accounting Service accounts that are
126 days past due for Salary-offset processing. The travel card vendor may also
initiate pay garnishment proceedings through the judicial system against
cardholder accounts over 126 days delinquent. Upon written request of the
travel card vendor, Department of Defense may act on their behalf and collect
by payroll deduction from the amount of pay owed to the cardholder any funds
the cardholder owes to the travel charge card vendor as a result of
delinquencies not disputed by the cardholder on the government travel charge
card. </p>

<p class="msonormal29">16.10.7.2. If the travel card vendor cannot
initiate pay garnishment proceedings and the cardholder account is over 210 days
delinquent, the travel card vendor will charge off the account and report the
delinquency to the credit bureau. The debt will then be collected through a
third party collection agency assigned by the travel card vendor. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.10.8.<b class="calibre1"> Collection of
Debts: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal25">16.10.8.1.<b class="calibre1"> Debts to
the Federal Government. </b>An Air Force member who owes debts to the federal
government or instrumentalities of the government does not have to give his or
her consent for the Air Force to collect. Generally, for debts that exceed
$100, the individual must be given due process (that is, the individual must
receive notification of the pending collection of a debt and be given a chance
to repay the debt before any withholding action occurs). However, due process
need not be completed before the start of a collection action if an
individual’s estimated date of separation is not sufficient to complete
collection and the Air Force would be unlikely to collect the debt. Due process
may not apply when the collection action can be completed within two monthly
pay periods. The Air Force may also collect debts involving any federal agency,
portions of a reenlistment bonus not served, delinquent hospital bills for
family members, excess shipment of household goods, loss or damage to
government property, and erroneous payments made to or on behalf of the member
by the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal28">16.10.8.2.<b class="calibre1">
Waiver and Remission Provisions. </b>Military members may request relief from
valid debts by applying for waiver or remission of the debt. The local
financial services office has specific guidance and can provide assistance
regarding these programs. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">16.10.8.3.<b class="calibre1">
Waiver of Claims for Erroneous Payments of Pay and Allowances. </b>When a
member receives erroneous pay or allowances, he or she may apply for a waiver
of claims by the United States. A waiver may be granted when there is no
indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the
part of the member or any other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver
of the claim. Defense Finance and Accounting Service will rule on all waivers.
When filing for a waiver, the collection of the indebtedness must be started. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">16.10.8.4. <b class="calibre1">Remission.</b>
A Regular Air Force or separated member, or his or her commander, may apply for
remission of a member’s indebtedness to the United States. The Air Force may
not remit or cancel any debt due to noncollection of court-martial forfeiture.
In addition to the circumstances creating the debt and the issue of good faith
on the part of the member, financial hardship may be a factor for
consideration.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

States Air Force Uniformed Thrift Savings Plan: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.11.1.<b class="calibre1"> Purpose. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal34">The Thrift Savings Plan is a retirement savings and
investment plan established for federal employees as part of the </p>

<p class="msonormal16">Federal Employees’ Retirement Act of 1986.
Participation in the plan for uniformed service members is authorized by law.
The plan offers Traditional Thrift Saving Plan, tax-deferred advantages similar
to those in an individual retirement account or 401(k) plan. Traditional Thrift
Saving Plan contributions can be taken out of pay before taxes are computed; as
a result, individual tax obligations are reduced. Roth contributions are taken
out of your paycheck after your income is taxed. When you withdraw your funds
at a future date, your contributions will be tax-free since you already paid
taxes on the contributions. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.11.2.<b class="calibre1"> Participating
in the Traditional and Roth Thrift Saving Plan. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">A member is authorized to contribute from 1 to 92
percent of their basic pay. Members are not permitted to contribute more than
92 percent of their basic pay so that required deductions of Social Security
and Medicare can be made. If a member is contributing to the Thrift Saving Plan
from basic pay, the member is also authorized to contribute bonuses, incentive,
or special pay.<span class="calibre6"> </span>As of January 2017, the maximum Thrift Savings Plan
contribution amount for 2017 is $18,000 for deferred and Roth contributions and
up to $54,000 total combined deferred/exempt Traditional and Roth
contributions. The amounts contributed to the traditional and Roth Thrift
Savings Plan must be stated as a whole percent. Members have the ability to
manage their Thrift Savings Plan via myPay; those requiring customer assistance
for Thrift Savings Plan pay-related questions, leave and earning statement
interpretations, and financial issues may contact their financial service
office. </p>

<p class="msonormal21">As stated in AFI 36-3003, <i class="calibre2">Military Leave Program</i>, lengthy respites from the work environment
tend to have a beneficial effect on an individual’s psychological and physical
status. Therefore, an effective leave program is an essential military
requirement. According to Department of Defense Instruction 1327.6, <i class="calibre2">Leave and Liberty Policy and Procedures</i>,
all officers in command, major headquarters, and the military departments shall
ensure that secondary and nonessential efforts, though desirable in themselves,
do no prevent an effective leave program. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.13. Accruing Leave.
</b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">The Air Force can pay members for unused leave at
certain points in their careers, such as reenlistment, retirement, separation
under honorable conditions, or death. By law, members may receive accrued leave
payment up to a maximum of 60 days during their military careers. However, the
department of Defense policy expresses Congressional concern that members use
leave to relax from the pressures of duties and not as a method of
compensation. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b> Members do not
earn leave when they are absent without official leave, in an unauthorized
leave status, in confinement as a result of a courtmartial sentence, in an
excess leave status, or on appellate leave under Title 10, United States Code,
Section 876a, <i class="calibre2">Leave Required to Be Taken
Pending Review of Certain Court-Martial Convictions</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.14. Special Leave
Accrual.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal4">Special leave accrual earned in combat zones may be
kept for 4 fiscal years; special leave accrual earned in support of operations
may now be kept for 2 fiscal years. An additional one-time special leave
accrual sell-back is authorized for enlisted service members. Under this
provision, an enlisted service member may sell back up to 30 days of special
leave accrual. Such a sell back counts toward the service member’s cap of 60 days
over a career. This provision has no termination date. Members lose any leave
in excess of 60 days at the end of the fiscal year unless they are eligible for
special leave accrual. Eligible members who lose leave on 1 October may have
only that portion of leave restored that could not possibly have been used
before the end of the fiscal year not to exceed 120 days. The wing or vice
commander has final approval authority and may be delegated no lower than the
first O-6 in the chain of command. Major command or field operating agency
directors of personnel or equivalents (Colonel or above) will approve special
leave accrual for their organizations. Any commander in the chain of command
may deny a member’s request for special leave accrual without referring the
member to a higher-level authority when the request does not meet the criteria
for special leave accrual consideration. Members are eligible for special leave
accrual if any of the following circumstances exist: </p>

<p class="msonormal8">16.14.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>A
member who serves on Regular Air Force while entitled to hostile fire/imminent
danger pay for a continuous period of at least 120 days are authorized to

year following the fiscal year in which the duty assignment in terminated. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">16.14.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Members
assigned to a non-hostile fire and/or non-imminent danger pay area for a
continuous period of at least 120 days are authorized to retain such leave up

the unit or qualifying duty until the end of the second fiscal year in which
the duty assignment is terminated. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.15. Beginning and
Ending Leave. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal38">Leave must begin and end in the local area. The
term “local area” means the place of residence from which the member commutes
to the duty station on a daily basis. This also applies to leave en route to a
permanent change of station or temporary duty assignment. In this case, the
local area, as defined at the old and new permanent duty station, applies. The
old permanent duty station is for beginning leave; the new permanent duty
station is for ending leave. Making a false statement of leave taken may result
in punitive action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Regardless of
the amount of leave authorized, Finance calculates leave based on the actual
date of departure and date of return. General rules on charging leave are as
follows: </p>

<p class="msonormal4">16.15.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Use
Air Force Form 988, <i class="calibre2">Leave
Request/Authorization</i>, for all types of leave and permissive temporary duty
when LeaveWeb cannot be used. (See AFMAN 65-116, Volume 2, <i class="calibre2">Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) Unit Procedures Excluding FSO</i>,
Chapter 7, for information concerning LeaveWeb.) (<b class="calibre1">Exception:</b> When members take leave en route with permanent change
of station or temporary duty travel, the financial service office uses the
travel voucher to determine authorized travel and chargeable leave.) Nonduty
days and holidays are chargeable leave days if they occur during an authorized
period of leave. If leave includes a weekend, a member cannot end leave on a
Friday and begin the leave again on Monday. Further, unit commanders will not
approve successive Monday through Friday leaves (or periods of leave
surrounding other nonduty days) except under emergency or unusual circumstances
as determined by the unit commander. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">16.15.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>A
member who is unable to report to duty upon expiration of leave because of
illness or injury must advise the leave approving authority. The next of kin,
attending physician, representative at the nearest medical treatment facility,
or American Red Cross representative may act on the member’s behalf when the
member is incapacitated and unable to provide notification. Upon returning from
leave, the member must present a statement from the nearest medical treatment
facility or attending physician regarding the member’s medical condition. (<b class="calibre1">Note:</b> The unit commander evaluates the
statement before authenticating the leave document.) If a member on leave
requires hospitalization or quarters status, leave is not charged while
hospitalized or on quarters. Chargeable leave ends the day before and starts
again the day following hospitalization or quarter’s status, regardless of the
hour of admission or discharge or release from quarters. The unit commander
issues an amended leave authorization, if required. </p>

<p class="msonormal38">16.15.3. The military personnel section and Air
Force Personnel Center/DPFCM (Missing Persons Branch) change the member’s leave
status to absent without official leave when the member fails to return to duty
at the end of his or her leave period. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.16. Extension of
Leave.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal39">The member must ask, orally or in writing, for an
extension of leave. The extension must be requested sufficiently in advance of
expiration of leave authorized to permit the member to return to duty at the
proper time if the approval authority disapproves the extension. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.17. Recall from
Leave.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal40">Unit commanders may recall members from leave for
military necessity or in the best interest of the Air Force. Refer to the joint
travel regulation to determine if travel and transportation allowances apply.
If the unit commander authorizes the member to resume leave after the member
completes the duty that resulted in recall, a new Air Force Form 988 or orders
must be prepared. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.18. Types of Leave.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal22">AFI 36-3003 outlines many types of leave, such as: </p>

<p class="msonormal41">16.18.1.<b class="calibre1"> Annual Leave.</b> Another name for “ordinary” leave is annual leave.
Normally, members request leave, as accruing (earning), within mission
requirements. Members use annual leave to take vacations, attend to parental
family needs such as illnesses, celebrate traditional national holiday periods,
attend spiritual events or other religious observances, or as terminal leave
with retirement or separation from Regular Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.18.2.<b class="calibre1"> Advance</b> <b class="calibre1">Leave.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Advance leave is leave granted based on a
reasonable expectation that a member will accrue at least that much leave
during the remaining period of active military service. The purpose of advance
leave is to enable members to resolve emergencies or urgent personal situations
when they have limited or no accrued leave. When a member has taken all the
advance leave that represents what he or she will be accruing during the
remaining period of active service, unit commanders change member’s leave
status from advance to excess leave. The financial service office stops or collects,
if applicable, all pay and allowances paid after the member’s leave status
changes from advance to excess leave. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.18.3.<b class="calibre1"> Convalescent
Leave.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">Convalescent leave is an authorized absence
normally for the minimal time needed to meet the medical needs for
recuperation. Convalescent leave is not chargeable leave. Unit commanders
normally approve convalescent leave based on recommendations by either the
medical treatment facility authority or physician most familiar with the
member’s medical condition. When a member elects civilian medical care at
personal expense and an Air Force physician determines the medical procedure as
elective by military medical treatment facility authorities, such as cosmetic
surgery, the member must use ordinary leave for all absences from duty,
including convalescence. When medical authorities determine a medical procedure
is necessary, such as childbirth, and the member elects civilian medical care,
the commander, upon the recommendation by either the medical treatment facility
authority or the attending physician most familiar with the member’s medical
condition may grant convalescent leave. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.18.4.<b class="calibre1"> Emergency
Leave.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">Emergency leave is chargeable leave granted for
personal or family emergencies involving the immediate family. Unit commanders
approve emergency leave; however, commanders can delegate leave approval to no
lower than the first sergeant for enlisted personnel. Normally, verification by
the America Red Cross is not necessary. However, when the official granting leave
has reason to doubt the validity of an emergency situation, he or she may
request assistance from the military service activity nearest the location of
the emergency or, when necessary, from the American Red Cross. The initial
period of emergency leave is usually for no more than 30 days with possible
extensions of an additional 30 days. If the individual needs an extension while
on emergency leave, he or she must contact the unit commander or first sergeant
for approval. Unit commanders should advise members to apply for a humanitarian
or exceptional family member reassignment or hardship discharge if the leave
period is more than 60 days. Air Force Personnel Center approves emergency
leave if leave requested results in a member having a cumulative negative leave
balance of over 30 days. The member may not request emergency leave for reasons
such as attending court hearings or the resolution of marital or financial
problems; the member may, however, request ordinary leave for these situations.
Situations when emergency leave is normally authorized include but are not
limited to: </p>

<p class="msonormal42">16.18.4.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>To
visit a terminally ill person in the immediate family of either the member or
the member’s spouse. </p>

<p class="msonormal43">16.18.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>When
there has been a verified death in the member’s immediate family or the
spouse’s immediate family. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">16.18.4.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Because
the member or someone in the member’s or spouse’s immediate family has a
life-threatening condition due to an accident, illness, or major surgery or is
admitted to an Intensive Care Unit due to a major illness or accident. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">16.18.4.4.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Because
the member is affected by a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, tornado,
flood, or earthquake, and a severe or unusual hardship would result if the
member failed to return home. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.18.5.<b class="calibre1"> En Route
Leave.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal24">En route leave is ordinary leave members use in
connection with permanent change of station, including their first change of
station upon completion of technical training. Members may request advance
leave when they do not have enough accrued leave to use as en route leave.
Normally, the losing unit commander approves up to 30 days en route leave with
any change of station move if the leave does not interfere with the reporting
date to either a port or new assignment. Members who complete basic or
technical training may request at least 10 days of leave en route if their
first duty station is in the continental United States. They may request at
least 14 days if going to an overseas assignment. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.18.6.<b class="calibre1"> Terminal
Leave. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal26">Terminal leave is chargeable leave taken in
conjunction with retirement or separation from Regular Air Force. The member’s
last day of leave coincides with the last day of Regular Air Force. Normally, a
member does not return to duty after terminal leave begins. The amount of leave
taken cannot exceed the leave balance at the date of separation. See AFI
36-3003 for guidance. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.18.7.<b class="calibre1"> Excess Leave.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal16">Excess leave is leave members normally use for
personal or family emergency situations when members cannot request advance
leave. Excess leave is a no-pay status; therefore, entitlement to pay and
allowances and leave accrual stops on the member’s first day of excess leave. A
member will not receive disability pay, if injured, for time spent on excess
leave. The period of excess leave will not count toward the fulfillment of any
Regular Air Force service commitment. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.18.8.<b class="calibre1"> Environmental
and Morale Leave. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal26">Environmental and morale leave is leave authorized
at overseas installations where adverse environmental conditions require
special arrangements for leave in desirable places at periodic intervals. The
environmental and morale leave taken is ordinary leave. Funded environmental
and morale leave is charged as ordinary leave, but members are authorized to
use Department of Defense-owned or -controlled aircraft; plus, travel time to
and from the environmental and morale leave destination is not charged as
leave. Unfunded environmental and morale leave is also charged as ordinary
leave, but members are authorized space-available air transportation from the
duty locations, and travel time to and from the leave destination is charged as
leave. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.19. Regular and
Special Passes.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal38">A pass period is an authorized absence from duty
for a relatively short time and starts from the end of normal work hours on a
duty day and ends at the beginning of normal work hours the next duty day.
There are no mileage restrictions. However, approval authorities may require
members to be able to return to duty within a reasonable time in the event of
an operational mission requirement such as a recall, unit alert, or unit
emergency. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.19.1.<b class="calibre1"> Regular Pass.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal25">A regular pass starts after normal work hours on a given
day and stops at the beginning of normal work hours the next duty day. This
includes nonduty days Saturday, Sunday, and a holiday for up to 3 days total if
a member normally works Monday through Friday or up to 4 days for a member who
works a nontraditional work schedule, such as a compressed workweek. The
combination of nonduty days and a public holiday may not exceed 4 days.
Department of Defense or higher management levels may determine that a Monday
or Friday is compensatory (comp) time off when a holiday is observed on a
Tuesday or Thursday, in which case a regular pass may consist of a weekend, a
comp day off, and a public holiday. </p>

<p class="msonormal44"><span class="calibre3"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal12"><span class="calibre3"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.19.2.<b class="calibre1"> Special Pass.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal31">Unit commanders may award 3- or 4-day special
passes for special occasions or circumstances, such as reenlistment or for some
type of special recognition or compensatory time off. They may delegate
approval to a level no lower than squadron section commander, deputies, or
equivalents. Special passes start after normal work hours on a given day. They
stop at the beginning of normal work hours on either the 4th day for a 3-day
special pass or the 5<sup class="calibre7">th</sup> day for a 4-day special pass. A 3-day
special pass can be Friday through Sunday, Saturday through Monday, or Tuesday
through Thursday. A 4-day special pass can be Thursday through Sunday or
Saturday through Tuesday or Friday through Monday. This applies to a normal
Monday through Friday workweek. Passes may be taken in conjunction with leave
without a duty day between the pass and leave period. The member must be
physically present in the local area when departing and returning from leave.
The pass can be taken before or after leave, but not both. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.20. Permissive
Temporary Duty. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">Permissive temporary duty is an administrative
absence for which funded temporary duty is not appropriate. Commanders may not
authorize permissive temporary duty in place of leave or a special pass or in
conjunction with special passes. Normally, Air Force Form 988 is used for all
types of permissive temporary duties. See AFI 36-3003 for complete information.
</p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.20.1.<b class="calibre1"> Authorized
PTDYs.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal20">Types of authorized permissive temporary duties include,
but are not limited to: </p>

<p class="msonormal13">16.20.1.1. Traveling to or in the vicinity of a new
permanent duty station to secure off-base housing before the member
out-processes the old permanent duty station. (Generally, members request
permissive temporary duty after signing in at the new permanent duty station.) </p>

<p class="msonormal20">16.20.1.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Accompanying
a dependent patient or military member patient to a designated medical
treatment facility not in the local area when the medical authority deems
permissive temporary duty essential. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">16.20.1.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>To
attend a Department of Defense sponsored employment assistance seminar under
the Transition Assistance Program when the member cannot schedule one locally
and when the member will separate or retire within 180 days. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">16.20.1.4.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Attending
national conventions or meetings hosted by service-connected organizations such
as the Military Officer Association, Air Force Sergeants Association, or the
Noncommissioned Officers Association. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.20.2.<b class="calibre1"> Permissive
Temporary Duty Not Authorized. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal20">Members are not authorized permissive temporary duties: </p>

<p class="msonormal20">16.20.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>To
search for a house in a close proximity permanent change of station move. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">16.20.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>In
conjunction with a permissive reassignment. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">16.20.2.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>To
attend a professional military education graduation when the graduate is a
coworker, friend, or military spouse. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">16.20.2.4.<b class="calibre1"> </b>To
attend a change of command or retirement ceremony. <b class="calibre1">Note: </b>The presiding official for a military retirement ceremony may
be authorized permissive temporary duty. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.21.
Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal45">16.21.1. Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite
Absence is in support of the Secretary of Defense utilization of the total
force policy. The program applies to creditable deployments and mobilizations
underway on, or commencing after,<span class="calibre3">            
</span>19 January 2007. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">16.21.2. The Secretary of Defense has directed
establishment of programs to recognize members who are required to mobilize or
deploy with a frequency beyond established rotation goals and
Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence as a new category of
administrative absence. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">16.21.3. The concept of operations is to establish
a yearly rotation goal of a deployment-to-dwell ratio of 1:2. That is, for
every 1 year a service member of the active component is deployed, he or she
must have 2 years at his or her home station. The yearly mobilization-to-dwell
ratio goal for the Reserve Component is 1:5 years. Post-Deployment/Mobilization
Respite Absence earned under these conditions is considered administrative
absence. </p>

<p class="msonormal46">16.21.4. For the purpose of accruing
Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence under this program, the Department
of the Air Force defines criteria as creditable deployments/temporary to the
land areas of Afghanistan or Iraq on or after </p>

<p class="msonormal22">19 January 2007, but before 1 October 2011. Aircrew
participating in missions into, out of, within or over the area of </p>

<p class="msonormal22">eligibility in support of military operations, count each
day of operation as 1 day of eligibility. Deployment is defined as a member
temporary duty under contingency, exercise, and deployment orders to these
locations. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">16.21.5. Creditable time continues to accrue during
periods of rest and relaxation, leave, and for temporary duties outside of
Afghanistan or Iraq of 30 consecutive days or less. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">16.21.6. For qualifying deployments and
mobilizations beginning on or after 1 October 2011, Active Component Airmen
who, on the first day of their current deployment, had deployed in excess of 12
months out of the previous 36 months, and who meet the other eligibility
criteria contained in AFI 36-3003, qualify for Post-Deployment/Mobilization
Respite Absence.<span class="calibre3">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.22. Program
Administration: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal47">16.22.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Commanders
can only delegate ordinary leave approval to the lowest supervisory level to
meet the needs of the unit. Supervisors should train personnel on the
requirements of the leave program and ensure they know how to use, LeaveWeb and
the Air Force Form 988 to request leave and permissive temporary duty. </p>

<p class="msonormal48">16.22.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Before
approving leave, supervisors should ensure members requesting leave have a
sufficient leave balance. Also, they must ensure members provide a valid
address and emergency telephone number where they can be reached. Before
signing the Air Force Form 988, follow the unit’s procedures to obtain a leave
authorization number. Leave numbers normally will not be given earlier than 14
days prior to the leave effective date. Members on leave should use risk
management principles to assess all hazards and control risks before excessive
or hazardous travel, especially when traveling by automobiles. Also,
supervisors should make sure the member has sufficient funds to return to duty
on time. If the documentation is not processed digitally, the unit leave
monitor sends Part I with authorization number to the servicing finance office
and gives Part II to the member after obtaining a leave authorization number.
The supervisor retains Part III for completion after the member returns from
leave. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">16.22.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>When
the member returns from leave, the supervisor determines how the member’s
actual leave dates compared to the first and last days of chargeable leave
reported on Air Force Form 988, Part I. The member signs Part III, and the
supervisor certifies the dates of leave and sends Part III to the commander
support staff for processing. If there is a change in the actual number of days
the member took, supervisors will follow the instructions listed in Part III. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b> The Air Force adopted the current
method of recording leave to prevent fraud in the leave reporting system. </p>

<p class="msonormal49">16.22.4.<b class="calibre1"> </b>LeaveWeb
is an Air Force system that automates the method of requesting and processing
leave (in lieu of using the hard copy Air Force Form 988). Under LeaveWeb, the
member requests ordinary leave which generates an e-mail to his or her
supervisor. The supervisor approves or disapproves the leave and, if approved,
sends the leave information to the unit leave monitor to validate. Once
validated, the leave is sent electronically to finance. The member prints a
copy of the approved leave form to hand-carry during leave. Upon returning from
leave, the member completes the necessary updates in LeaveWeb and forwards the
e-mail to his or her supervisor for endorsement. This electronic process
reduces waste in materials as well as man-hours. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 16E—Equal Opportunity </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.23. Equal
Opportunity Policy: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal39">16.23.1. The Air Force is a richly diverse
community consisting of Airmen, military and civilian, with widely varied
backgrounds, beliefs, multicultural influences, and many unique life
experiences. Airmen are most effective when they are working in an environment
that promotes teamwork, inclusion, and mutual respect. Therefore, we must train
and prepare our Airmen to view human relation issues and circumstances more
broadly. This will allow them to effectively understand, engage, and defeat any
potential adversary or personal situation with intelligence and integrity. </p>

<p class="msonormal50">16.23.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>The
Equal Opportunity Program proactively engages all Airmen in the pursuit of
equal opportunity. The Air Force Equal Opportunity Program has been developed
to foster and support equal opportunity, the Air Force Core Values and </p>

<p class="msonormal6">Airman’s Creed, and must be carried out in the day-to-day
actions of all personnel. The Air Force will not tolerate unlawful
discrimination and unlawful harassment or reprisal against individuals who
engage in protected activity. Airmen must actively make workplace
professionalism a top priority and take proactive steps to prevent, correct and
eliminate unlawful discriminatory behavior. Air Force Equal Opportunity policy
compliance is a function of leadership. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.24. Equal
Opportunity Program Objectives: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">16.24.1. The primary objective of the program is to
eradicate unlawful discrimination. The Equal Opportunity office will assist
commanders at all levels in conducting a continuing campaign to eradicate every
form of unlawful discrimination or harassment from the workplace. In order to
promote a workplace free of unlawful discrimination, to include sexual
harassment, the Equal Opportunity office will take proactive steps to ensure
all available efforts are in place (for example, human relations education,
commander’s calls, climate assessments). </p>

<p class="msonormal4">16.24.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>The
program also seeks to foster a positive human relations environment. The Equal
Opportunity office will use the Human Relations Climate Assessment Subcommittee
Installation Equal Opportunity Assessment Summary and Defense Equal Opportunity
Management Institute Organization Climate Survey tool to evaluate positive and
negative factors in the local environment. Human relations education is also
provided through proactive measures to ensure all employees and management
personnel understand the need for a positive human relations environment. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.25. Unlawful
Discrimination: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">16.25.1. Unlawful discrimination against military
members includes any unlawful action that denies Equal Opportunity to persons
or groups based on their race, color, religion, national origin, sexual
orientation or sex (including sexual harassment). This type of discrimination
can occur in a variety of forms to include: in writing, verbal, or in a
combination. Unlawful discrimination can occur on or off base. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">16.25.2. Unlawful discrimination against Department
of Defense civilian employees includes any unlawful employment practice that
occurs when an employer fails or refuses to hire or promote, discharges, or
otherwise discriminates against any individual with respect to compensation,
terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or limits, segregates, or
classifies employees or applicants for employment in any way that deprives or
tends to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise
adversely affects his/her status as an employee because of race, color,
religion, national origin, sex, (including sexual harassment, pregnancy, gender
identity, and sexual orientation age (40 or older), genetic information,
physical or mental disability, or reprisal. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">16.25.3. Unlawful discrimination can also include
the use of disparaging terms regarding an individual’s birthplace, ancestry,
culture, or the linguistic characteristics common to a specific ethnic group.
The use of terms that degrade or connote negative statements pertaining to
race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, genetic information, and
mental or physical disability can constitute unlawful discrimination. These terms
include insults, printed material, visual material, signs, symbols, posters, or
insignia. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">16.25.4. The operational language of the Air Force
is English. Air Force personnel must maintain sufficient proficiency in English
to perform their official/military duties. All official communications must be
understood by everyone who has a need to know their content. Commanders may
require Air Force personnel to use English only when such use is clearly
necessary and proper for the performance of military duties. Accordingly,
commanders, supervisors, and managers at all levels must not require the use of
English for personal communications unrelated to official duties. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.26. Sexual
Harassment: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal51">16.26.1. Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination
that involves unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other
verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: </p>

<p class="msonormal20">16.26.1.1. Submission to such conduct is made either
explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of a person’s job, pay, or career.
</p>

<p class="msonormal43">16.26.1.2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by a
person is used as a basis for career or employment decisions affecting this
person. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">16.26.1.3. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of
unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creates an
intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">16.26.2. This definition emphasizes that workplace
conduct, to be actionable as an “abusive work environment,” harassment need not
result in concrete psychological harm to the victim, but rather need only be so
severe or pervasive that a reasonable person would perceive, and the victim
does perceive, the work environment as hostile or offensive. Workplace is an expansive
term for military members and may include conduct on or off duty, 24 hours a
day. </p>

<p class="msonormal52">16.26.3. Any person in a supervisory or command
position who uses or condones any form of sexual behavior to control,
influence, or affect the career, pay, or job of a military member or civilian
employee is engaging in sexual harassment. Similarly, any military member or
civilian employee who makes deliberate or repeated unwelcome verbal comments,
gestures, or physical contact of a sexual nature in the workplace is also
engaging in sexual harassment. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">16.27. Military Equal
Opportunity Complaint Process: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.27.1. <b class="calibre1">Authorization.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal53">Only military personnel, their
family members, and retirees may file military Equal Opportunity complaints. To
file a complaint, the individual must be the subject of the alleged unlawful
discrimination or sexual harassment. Third parties, to include commanders,
supervisors or co-workers, may not file a complaint on behalf of another
individual. The Equal Opportunity office will refer all third party individuals
who are aware of specific allegations of military </p>

<p class="msonormal20">Equal Opportunity policy violations to their respective
chain of command. The Equal Opportunity office will not </p>

<p class="msonormal20">accept military complaints from military members, family
members or retirees if their concern is related to their off-base or Department
of Defense civilian employment. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.27.2. <b class="calibre1">Military
Informal Complaint Procedures</b>. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">The purpose of the military informal complaint process is
to attempt resolution at the lowest possible level. </p>

<p class="msonormal29">16.27.2.1. To informally resolve unlawful
discrimination and sexual harassment complaints, individuals may orally address
or prepare written correspondence to the alleged offender, request intervention
by a coworker, opt to use the alternate dispute resolution process, or use the
chain of command (for example, request assistance from the supervisor, first
sergeant, or commander). </p>

<p class="msonormal20">16.27.2.2. There is no time limit for filing informal
complaints and no requirement for commander approval before accepting informal
complaints. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">16.27.2.3. Informal sexual harassment complaints
must be processed in accordance with Title 10, United States Code, Section
1561, <i class="calibre2">Complaints of Sexual Harassment:
Investigation by Commanding Officers</i> and complaint allegations must be forwarded
to the applicable General Court-Martial Convening Authority. The commander must
initiate a Commander Directed Investigation. The Equal Opportunity office will
serve as Subject Matter Experts for commanders and organizations conducting
sexual harassment investigations. The Commander Directed Investigation process
for sexual harassment complaints must be complete within 14 calendar days. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">16.27.3. <b class="calibre1">Military
Formal Complaint Procedures:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal28">16.27.3.1. The purpose of the military formal
complaint process is to enable military members, retirees and their family
members to formally present allegations of unlawful discrimination and sexual
harassment to the Equal Opportunity office with the goal of attempting
resolution through a complaint clarification process. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">16.27.3.1.1. Complaint clarification is the process

aggrieved person can file a complaint if discriminated against on the basis of
race, color, religion, sex, (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation)
national origin, age (40 and older), or disability, or if subjected to sexual
harassment or retaliated against for opposing discrimination or for
participating in the complaint process. Additionally, an employee can file a
complaint under Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of
2008, which prohibits genetic information discrimination for any aspect of
employment, including hiring, firing, pay, job assignments, promotion, layoff,
training, fringe benefits, or any other term or condition of employment. To
harass or retaliate against a person because of his or her genetic information
is illegal under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. </p>

<p class="msonormal"><b class="calibre1">Chapter 25 </b></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre1">PROFESSIONALISM </b></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 25A—Overview </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">25.1 Introduction: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">25.1.1. The Profession of Arms requires unique expertise to
fulfill our collective responsibility to the American people.<span class="calibre3">  </span>It is distinguished from others in society
because of our expertise in the justified application of lethal military force
and the willingness of those who serve to die for our Nation. Our profession is
defined by our values, ethics, standards, skills and attributes. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">25.1.2. The U.S. Air Force and its Airmen wield our Nation’s
most powerful and responsive weapons. Every member of the U.S. Air Force
team--Regular Air Force, Guard, Reserve and civilian--is entrusted with the
responsibility of preserving U.S. national security. We provide vital skills to
help ensure the Air Force is ready to answer our Nation’s call. The trust
placed by the Nation in our Airmen rests upon confidence in the character and
competency of the men and women who serve. To continue this trust we must
maintain and project power within the boundaries of a very sacred and honored
Air Force ideal…one based on our Air Force Core Values of <i class="calibre2">Integrity First, Service Before Self </i>and <i class="calibre2">Excellence In All We Do</i>. Guided by these Core Values, the Air Force
will continue to develop and inspire our Airmen within the Profession of Arms. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">25.1.3. We are worthy of the Nation’s trust through actions
consistent with our Air Force Core Values summarized in one word:
professionalism. As a service we maintain the trust of our Nation by
integrating our Air Force Core Values into mission accomplishment daily,
infusing professionalism into everything we do. Professionalism describes who
we are as a service; how we conduct ourselves and live our lives; and it sets
the standards to which all Airmen will be expected to adhere and exceed.
Professionalism is about learning to lead oneself…it is not just about what we
do but also how we do it. Professionalism within the Air Force is framed by the
requirement for trust, loyalty, dignity and personal commitment.
Professionalism is the heart and soul of who we are and who we aspire to be
every day. Our sense of professionalism underlies the pride we feel when we say
<i class="calibre2">I am an American Airman</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">25.1.4. This Roadmap is universal and reaches across every
element and operation within the Air Force. Whether in war or peace, at home or
abroad, on or off duty, our Airmen must hold true to the sacred trust our
institution requires. A trust that respects all our fellow Airmen strives to
bring out the best version of our people, commits to a higher calling of
service and holds those who fail to maintain the honor our standards demand
fully accountable. As Airmen we continually seek to deepen and foster our
commitment to high personal standards of conduct. Ultimately, we instill and
value who we are as Airmen within the Profession of Arms as our hallmark to
shape and sustain Air Force culture today and well into the future. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">25.1.5. In
direct support of the objectives outlined in this Roadmap, we established the
Profession of Arms Center of Excellence (PACE) as an Air Force-level Center on
March 2, 2015. PACE will champion our focused commitment to collaborating,
coordinating and developing areas of growth and leadership for all of our
Airmen. PACE, working closely with organizations across the Air Force, will
help to provide deliberate, institution-wide strategies focused on supporting
professionalism efforts with a common goal of enriching and enhancing the Air
Force Profession of Arms. As a dedicated champion to the Air Force Profession
of Arms, PACE will provide leadership, education and connectivity with current
and emerging cylinders of excellence currently focused on enhancing human
capital within the unique Profession of Arms. Through PACE, the Air Force
senior leadership has a dedicated institution for direct focus and ability to
modify specific Air Force requirements within the Profession of Arms. This
Roadmap outlines an expectation, mindset and standard for which all future PACE
operations will focus. An electronic copy of the Strategic Roadmap is available
by <a href="http://www.airman.af.mil/Portals/17/001%20Home%20Page/008%20-%20StrategicRoadmap/StrategicRoadmap.pdf?ver=2016-03-07-154949-547" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre4">clicking on this link.</span></a><a href="http://www.airman.af.mil/Portals/17/001%20Home%20Page/008%20-%20StrategicRoadmap/StrategicRoadmap.pdf?ver=2016-03-07-154949-547" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5"> </span></a><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section

<p class="msonormal4">25.2.1. Air Force Profession of Arms: (the <i class="calibre2">Context</i>) </p>

<p class="msonormal6">A vocation comprised of experts in the design, generation,
support and application of global vigilance, global reach and global power
serving under civilian authority, entrusted to defend the Constitution and
accountable to the American people. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">25.2.2. Air Force Professional: (the <i class="calibre2">Identity</i>) </p>

<p class="msonormal6">An Airman (Regular Air Force, Reserve, Guard or civilian)
is a trusted servant to our Nation who demonstrates unquestionable competence,
adheres to the highest ethical standards and is a steward of the future of the
Air Force profession. Air Force professionals are distinguished by a willing
commitment and loyalty to the Air Force Core Values. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">25.2.3. Air Force Professionalism: (the <i class="calibre2">Spirit</i>) </p>

<p class="msonormal6">A personal commitment and loyalty to Air Force standards
and expectations framed within an environment of shared trust, guided by Air

who do the RIGHT thing - the RIGHT way - for the RIGHT reason.</i></b> </p>

<p class="msonormal4">The future of the U.S. Air Force rests on the degree to
which we can continue to attract, recruit, develop and retain individuals
committed to the Profession of Arms and Air Force Core Values. Airmen must be trusted
professionals with exemplary character, judgment and competence, who hold
themselves and their fellow Airmen accountable. As a profession, these
characteristics are expected and directed for both individuals who serve in the
Air Force as well as for the institution itself. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1">25.4. Professionalism Mission: <i class="calibre2">Leaders
forging professional Airmen who embody Integrity, Service and Excellence.</i></b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal4">Every Airman, including those who are leaders and those who
aspire to lead, will be vital to the process of developing our personnel. The
Air Force will proactively develop each of our Airmen within a professional
culture requiring the highest degree of commitment toward institutional
standards. Our standards require Airmen to make the right choices guided by the
Air Force Core Values at all times. </p>

depend on the commitment and engagement of every Airman.<span class="calibre3">  </span>This strategic roadmap represents Air Force guidance
that applies to operations across all service responsibilities and is designed

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 25C—America’s Air Force:
A Profession of Arms.</i> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">25.7 The Little Blue
Book. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">First, we must understand that our chosen profession is that
of a higher calling, in which we hold ourselves to higher standards. To serve
proudly and capably, our commitment to our cause must be unbreakable; it must
be bonded in our mutual respect for each other. Throughout our service we are
guided and reminded of this awesome responsibility to our nation. The oaths we
take remind us that we serve freely in support and defense of our Constitution.
Our Air Force Core Values serve as our compass and provide the fortified
foundation of our service. We abide by a Code of Conduct that captures our
resolve, while our Airman’s Creed highlights the strength of our diverse Airmen
who fly, fight and win as one Air Force. We are the world’s greatest Air
Force...powered by Airmen, fueled by innovation; this book serves as a guide to
the principles that make us so strong. Wherever you are in your Air Force
career, it is a reminder to the meaning of service in our profession...The
Profession of Arms. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">25.7.1.<b class="calibre1"> A Profession
of Arms: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.1.1. No profession asks more of its members than the
Profession of Arms. As we state in our Airman’s Creed, we have answered our
nation’s call. It is a higher calling, and it comes with a higher standard. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.1.2. General Ronald Fogleman, our 15th Chief of Staff
once said, “We are not engaged in just another job; we are practitioners of the
Profession of Arms. We are entrusted with the security of our nation, the
protection of our citizens and the preservation of its way of life. In this
capacity, we serve as guardians of America’s future. By its very nature, this
responsibility requires us to place the needs of our service and our country
before personal concerns.” </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.1.3. That responsibility was given to each and every
one of us when we raised our right hand and swore to support and defend the
Constitution of the United States. When we joined our Air Force with a sacred
oath, we accepted a sacred trust from the American people, one that goes beyond
anything else in society. As members of a joint team, our profession is
distinguished from others because of our expertise in the justified application
of lethal military force and the willingness of those who serve to pay the
ultimate sacrifice for our nation. No other profession expects its members to
lay down their lives for their friends, families or freedoms...but it’s what
our profession readily expects. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.1.4. And make no mistake, this is a profession. We are
professionals. As volunteers, our sworn obligation is to the Constitution.
Fighting America’s wars is an ugly business - there is nothing pretty about it,
cool about it or glorious about it - but it must be done, and somebody must be
good at it. We’re good at it. Our status as the world’s greatest Air Force was
earned by the men and women who have gone before us, and is carried on by every
Airman who wears the uniform today. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.1.5. All service men and women belong to the
Profession of Arms, from the most junior enlisted to our most senior leaders. We
are all accountable for meeting ethical and performance standards in our
actions and similarly accountable for our failure to take action, when
appropriate. The distinction between ranks lies solely in our level of
responsibility and the degree of accountability...not in our level of
commitment to the Profession of Arms. We share the common attributes of
character, courage and competence. We qualify as professionals through
intensive training, education and practical experience. As professionals, we are
defined by our strength of character, a life- long commitment to core values
and a dedication to maintain our professional abilities through continuous
improvement, individually and institutionally. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.1.6. We must remember above all else, we are patriots
first. As service men and women we, more than anyone else, understand the price
paid for freedom. We, more than anyone else, understand the sacrifices that
come from willingly serving our country. We, more than anyone else, understand
what it means to serve in the Profession of Arms. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">25.7.2.<b class="calibre1"> Respect: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.2.1. Respect is at the root of the Profession of Arms
and bonds every Airman who voluntarily serves. Respect is the feeling of esteem
or deference for a person or other entity, but in the Air Force it takes on a
greater meaning and importance. Respect is the lifeblood of our profession.
Without it, we simply cannot stand strong in the defense of our nation. Mutual
respect strengthens our team and eliminates seams that reveal a weakness in the
force. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.2.2. Respect in the Profession of Arms goes beyond
professional courtesy. It means accepting others for who they are, embracing a
heightened personal sense of humility and fostering an environment of
inclusiveness in which every Airman is able and eager to offer their skills,
abilities and ideas. It means treating the equipment and resources in our
possession with care, understanding and embracing the power of diversity and
holding those who mistreat others accountable. More than anything, we must
respect the humbling mission placed in our hands by the American people, and
the impact our weapons and our actions can have around the globe. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.2.3. Our Air Force is a critical part of the greatest
fighting force the world has ever known; it’s powered by the greatest Airmen
the world has ever seen. Through respect for each other, our resources and our
mission, we will continue to provide Global Vigilance, Global Reach and Global
Power for America. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">25.7.3.<b class="calibre1"> Air Force Core
Values.<span class="calibre3">  </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">Values represent enduring, guiding principles for which we
as individuals or organizations stand. “Core” values are so fundamental that
they define our very identity. The United States Air Force has clearly defined
its identity by these three simple values: Integrity First, Service Before
Self, and Excellence In All We Do. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">For those of us who join this proud community of Airmen -
whether officer, enlisted, civilian, Active, Guard, or Reserve - being a part
of the Air Force family requires we commit to living these values, on and off
duty. This is the expectation of our profession, and is the standard against
which our fellow service members and the American public hold us. The Air Force
Professional is a trusted servant of our Nation who adheres to the highest
standards of character, courage and competence. How we act represents to countless
others the collective identity of the United States Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">25.7.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> The
Challenge. Living the Core Values: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.3.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Understanding
the Core Values is relatively easy. The true challenge is to live them. It’s a
commitment that never ends, and one that always matters. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.3.1.2.<b class="calibre1"> </b>We
all have the ability to display integrity, both professionally and personally.
We have all placed ourselves in a position to serve a greater purpose. And we
all have the innate desire to achieve excellence. Yet there will be moments
where living and acting by the Core Values will be challenging. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.3.1.3.<b class="calibre1"> </b>These
moments are also opportunities to prove, through our actions, that we truly
embody these Core Values. In doing so, we honor the heritage and continue the
legacy of those who served before us and sacrificed so much. It is through this
alignment of our actions with these values that we, as an Air Force, earn the
public’s trust, strengthen our Service, and accomplish our mission. These are
the Core Values of our Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.3.1.4.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Each
of these Core Values is further defined by virtues (desired behaviors and
characteristics) we must practice and demonstrate in our daily lives, showing
we truly do value Integrity, Service and Excellence. Consistently practicing
these virtues results in habits of honorable thought and action, producing an
Air Force Professional. Air Force Professionalism is a shared belief in, and a
commitment to, honorable service based on our Air Force Core Values. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">25.7.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> Integrity
First: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.3.2.1. Integrity is simply doing the right thing, all
the time, whether everyone is watching or no one is watching. It is the compass
that keeps us on the right path when we are confronted with ethical challenges
and personal temptations, and it is the foundation upon which trust is built.
An individual realizes integrity when thoughts and actions align with what he
or she knows to be right. The virtues that demonstrate one truly values
integrity include: </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.3.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Honesty
is the hallmark of integrity.</b> As public servants, we are trusted agents.
Honesty requires us to evaluate our performance against standards, and to
conscientiously and accurately report findings. It drives us to advance our
skills and credentials through our own effort. The service member’s word must
be unquestionable. This is the only way to preserve the trust we hold so dear
with each other and with the population we serve. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.3.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Courage
is not the absence of fear, but doing the right thing despite the fear.</b>
Courage empowers us to take necessary personal or professional risks, make
decisions that may be unpopular, and admit to our mistakes; having the courage
to take these actions is crucial for the mission, the Air Force, and the
Nation. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.3.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Accountability
is responsibility with an audience.</b> That audience may be the American
people, our units, our supervisors, our fellow Airmen, our families, our loved
ones, and even ourselves. Accountable individuals maintain transparency, seek
honest and constructive feedback, and take ownership of the outcomes of their
actions and decisions. They are responsible to themselves and others and
refrain from actions which discredit themselves or our service. </p>

<p class="msonormal14"><span class="calibre3"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal16">25.7.3.3. <b class="calibre1">Service
Before Self: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.3.3.1. Service before self tells us that professional
duties take precedence over personal desires. The call to serve is a call to
live according to a higher standard. It is not just a job; it is a commitment
that takes energy, dedication, and sacrifice. We do not “work” in the Air
Force; we serve in the Air Force. A heart and mindset for service allows us to
embrace expectations and requirements not levied on the American public or
other professions. The virtues that demonstrate one truly values service
include: </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.3.3.2. Duty is the obligation to perform what is
required for the mission. While our responsibilities are determined by the law,
the Department of Defense, and Air Force instructions, directives, and
guidance, our sense of duty is a personal one and bound by the oath of service
we took as individuals. Duty sometimes calls for sacrifice in ways no other
profession has or will. Airmen who truly embody Service Before Self
consistently choose to make necessary sacrifices to accomplish the mission, and
in doing so, we honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.3.3.3. Loyalty is an internal commitment to the
success and preservation of something bigger than ourselves. Our loyalty is to
the Nation first, the values and commitments of our Air Force second, and
finally to the men and women with whom we serve. Loyalty to our leaders
requires us to trust, follow, and execute their decisions, even when we disagree.
We offer alternative solutions and innovative ideas most effectively through
the chain of command. Ultimately, loyalty is demonstrated by helping each other
act with honor. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.3.3.4. Respect is treating others with dignity and
valuing them as individuals. We must always act knowing that all Airmen possess
fundamental worth as human beings. We must treat others with the utmost dignity
and respect, understanding that our diversity is a great source of strength. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">25.7.3.4. <b class="calibre1">Excellence
In All We Do: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.3.4.1. Excellence in all we do does not mean that we
demand perfection in everything from everyone. Instead, this value directs us
to continuously advance our craft and increase our knowledge as Airmen. We must
have a passion for continuous improvement and innovation that propels America’s
Air Force in quantum leaps towards accomplishment and performance. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.3.4.2. <b class="calibre1">Mission
focus encompasses operations, product and resources excellence.</b> The complex
undertaking of the Air Force mission requires us to harness the ingenuity,
expertise, and elbow grease of all Airmen. We approach it with the mindset of
stewardship, initiative, improvement, pride, and a continued commitment to
anticipate and embrace change. Our work areas, our processes, and our
interpersonal interactions must be undeniably professional and positive. Our
people are the platform for delivering innovative ideas, strategies, and
technologies to the fight. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.3.4.3. <b class="calibre1">Discipline
is an individual commitment to uphold the highest of personal and professional
standards.</b> Airmen commit to a life of discipline and self-control. We
demonstrate it in attitude, work ethic, and effort directed at continuous
improvement, whether it be pursuing professional military education or
nurturing ourselves physically, intellectually, emotionally, or spiritually.
Each Airman represents the entire Air Force. Our appearance, actions, and words
shape the culture of the Air Force and the reputation of the entire military
profession. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">25.7.3.4.4. <b class="calibre1">Teamwork
is essential to triumph at every level.</b> Airmen recognize the
interdependency of every member’s contributions towards the mission and strive
for organizational excellence. We not only give our personal best, but also
challenge and motivate each other. We carry our own weight, and whenever
necessary, help our wingmen carry theirs. We serve in the greatest Air Force in
the world, and we embrace the idea that our part of the Air Force meets that
world-class standard.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">25.8. Conclusion.<span class="calibre3">  </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">Continuing to do things the same way we always have is sure
to lead to the same results we have already seen. Our Air Force of the 21<sup class="calibre6">st</sup>
Century can’t afford to do what we have always done—we must continue to
transform ourselves! We must work today to transform the Air Force of tomorrow
to meet our next challenges. The foundation of our Air Force professionalism
resides in our commitment and the oath we took to serve our country. Let’s work
together today to strengthen an environment that allows all Airmen to build
trust and credibility with the nation they serve and start to forge our place
in the future evolution and superiority of our Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre1">HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT </b></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 22A—Power </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">22.1. Introduction</b>: </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.1.1. The concept of power in the workforce has a negative
connotation and brings to mind such associations as coercion, manipulation, and
even corruption. This does not have to be the case. Power has many positive
aspects, and everyone can learn to explore and harness different sources of the
individual power they have in the workplace. By developing their own sources of
power, employees will be less dependent on others for the leadership they need,
and thus be better able to take initiative and make greater contributions in
their jobs. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.1.2. Develop your own program called <i class="calibre2">Situational Self
Leadership</i>, and take a different perspective on power. Develop an
understanding that “the sole advantage of power is the ability to do more
good.” Thus, if you want to do more good for yourself and more good for the
people around you, it is important to learn how to tap into your own points of
power. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">22.2. Aspects of Power: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Position power </b>is inherent in the authority
of the position you have. You have position power when your business card has a
title printed on it that indicates you have the power to manage people or
command resources. My dad, an officer in the Navy, used to say, “The best
leaders are those who have position power and never have to use it.” </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> Task power</b> is power that stems from being
good at a particular task at work and being able to help others with a process
or procedure they may need to do. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">22.2.3.<b class="calibre1"> Personal power </b>comes from your personal
character attributes such as strength of character, passion, inspiration, or a
personal vision of the future. Personal power is further enhanced by the
strength of your interpersonal skills, such as your ability to communicate well
and to be persuasive with others. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.2.4.<b class="calibre1"> Relationship power </b>comes from association
with others through friendship, personal understanding of a colleague, and
cultivation of a relationship, nepotism, or reciprocity (trading favors). </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.2.5.<b class="calibre1"> Knowledge power </b>is about having expertise in
an area. This is often through knowing a special skill or group of skills in
your job, but is also evidenced by having certain degrees or certifications
indicating special training. Knowledge power can often be transferred from job
to job or from organization to organization, and is a general type of power. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">22.3. Charting Your Points of Power:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.3.1. An enlightening activity is to list a number of
workplace situations or conditions where you feel you have the power to
influence outcomes or people. Next to each item, categorize the type of power
you have in that circumstance. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.3.2. Now draw a five-pointed star with ten hash marks
from the center to the tip of each point. From the center of the star, mark off
the corresponding number of responses you listed in your assessment of each
type of power. The farthest hash mark you indicate on each arm of the star
becomes the new tip of that arm. Connect these new points. The resulting
graphic should be some semblance of a star, with certain points having more
emphasis and others having less. This will show you your primary points of power
at a glance. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.3.3. If you want to be a real star in the workplace, try
to develop a strategy to balance the points of power where you work. Some
examples: </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.3.3.1. You have high knowledge power due to expertise in
analysis, and are often asked to analyze situations and report your findings in
meetings. However, you are weak in personal power and your ability to
communicate is poor. Your strategy might be to take a presentation skills
course or to ask someone to critique a presentation before you give it to the
group. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.3.3.2. You have high task power and need to present an
idea to the head of your department, but are somewhat weak in relationship
power. Your strategy could be to ask a coworker who has the ear of the
department head to give you feedback on how he or she thinks the department
head will react to your idea. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.3.3.3. You have task power and are working on a very
visible project, but you lack position power, which might make it difficult to
get support. Your strategy could be to use your task power to solicit a sponsor
or champion who will help promote your project and your credibility. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.3.3.4. You have personal power, but are weak in
relationship power. Your strategy might be to use your social skills to
network. Ask others for instructions, attend meetings of professional
organizations, or schedule lunches to help build relationships. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">22.3.4. Take advantage of the points of power where you are
strong. Use your power in a positive way to do more good for yourself and those
around you. If people throughout your organization are enabled to develop their
sources of power, it could create a more even playing field for everyone. Power
doesn’t have to be concentrated in the hands of a few. </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 22B—Unit
Morale</i></b> </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">22.4. Contemporary Motivation: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.4.1. Contemporary motivation is a simple, three-phased
approach to motivation. This approach states that people can be in one of three
levels of commitment to the organization—the membership level (at the lowest
end), the performance level, or the involvement level (highest level). A
person’s level of commitment determines how motivated he or she is to
accomplish the mission. The more committed a person is to the organization, the
more involved he or she is in the organization. Supervisors can help to ensure
the proper rewards are provided so individuals can move to, or remain in, a
higher commitment level. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.4.2. Are methods available to measure unit morale or
motivation levels? Yes. For instance, the Inspector General uses a climate
assessment instrument to assess a unit’s morale. Mark Alexander, author of the
article, <i class="calibre2">Organizational Norms, The 1977 Annual Handbook for Group
Facilitators</i> (1977), defines a set of organizational norms and maintains
that identifying and evaluating organizational norms will result in a morale
score. He identified 10 norms categories, but we will only examine seven.
Paragraph 22.5 is an excerpt from the article and norms survey. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">22.5. Organizational Norms. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">Within any organizational situation, behavioral forces influence
individual effectiveness and job satisfaction. To a certain extent, these
forces are a result of organization requirements that people behave and act in
certain ways, that they hold certain values and sentiments, and that they
interact with others in a particular manner. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">22.5.1.<b class="calibre1"> Required and Emergent Behavior. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">An organization’s required behavior, sentiments, and
interactions are not necessarily in effect. Existent or emergent behaviors,
sentiments, and interactions, in many cases, have a much greater influence on
organization life than required behavior. Emergent behavior correspondingly
affects productivity, individual satisfaction, and personal development.
Behavioral scientists generally recognize that emergent organizational behavior
is determined largely by formation of working group behavioral norms. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.5.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Norms are desirable behaviors. They are
considered acceptable behavior as prescribed by work groups and, in the larger
context, by society and its institutions. There are numerous examples
throughout work and everyday life of emergent behavior and the underlying norms
that cause this behavior. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.5.1.2. In the work environment, a tendency to establish
start and quit times that vary from company policy, or a work group’s
inclination to establish a quicker or slower pace than required are two
often-cited examples. Outside the work situation, normative (or emergent)
behavior also occurs, and can be observed in schools, institutions, or anywhere
that people come together and interact for a period of time. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">22.5.2.<b class="calibre1"> Positive or Negative Norms. </b>From
the organization’s view, norms can be positive or negative. Recent studies on
organizational norms indicate that they can be broken into categories, and that
certain types or clusters of positive or negative norms can exist in a given
work situation. 22.5.2.1. Positive norms are those that support the organization’s
goals and objectives and foster behavior directed toward achieving those goals.
Norms that support hard work, loyalty, quality, and concern for customer
satisfaction are examples of positive norms. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.5.2.2. Negative norms have just the opposite effect.
They promote behavior that works to prevent the organization from achieving its
objectives. Negative norms are those that sanction criticism of the company,
theft, absenteeism, and low levels of productivity. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11"><b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12"><b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">22.6. Norm Categories: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">22.6.1.<b class="calibre1"> Organizational and Personal
Pride. </b>Norms in this category are associated with an individual’s feelings
of identification and sense of pride regarding the organization. Positive norms
lead the person to see the organization as “his” or “hers.” Negative norms are
reflected in a “we” and “they” attitude toward the organization and its goals.
Examples of positive and negative organizational and personal pride norms are
evident in the competition between military organizations. If competition helps
the units become better at their missions and exhibit greater morale and
motivation, then competition is positive. On the other hand, if competition
hampers the mission and leads to reduced morale and motivation, competition is
negative. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">22.6.2.<b class="calibre1"> Teamwork and Communication. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">These norms are reflected in the visible behaviors where
individuals work together (cooperate). Negative norms foster individuality,
secrecy, and the belief that success is achieved by an attitude of “every man
for himself.”  Positive norms promote sharing of information and working
together to achieve common goals. Thomas Jefferson noted that a candle loses
nothing when it lights another candle; that is the real nature of partnership
and teamwork: give freely of yourself and you will be rewarded with abundance.
Promoting a positive norm is even more critical as all military branches and
government agencies work together to counter global threats and to combat
terrorism at home and abroad. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">22.6.3.<b class="calibre1"> Leadership and Supervision. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">Leadership norms can enhance or hinder effective
supervision. Negative norms cause supervisors to assume more active roles, like
constantly policing and monitoring Airmen. Positive norms result in supervisors
assuming the role of subordinate helpers, trainers, and developers. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">22.6.4.<b class="calibre1"> Profitability and Cost Effectiveness. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">This group of norms determines people’s behavior with
respect to profit and cost consciousness. Positive norms encourage people to
save money and reduce costs; negative norms foster a lack of concern for bottom
line performance. You may have heard someone say “it’s good enough for
government work.” That is a negative norm that has been perpetuated over the
years, but is one our Air Force cannot afford if we are to effectively
accomplish our mission of defending the United States and protecting its
interests through superior air and space power. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">22.6.5.<b class="calibre1"> Customer Relations. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">Norms in this group result in individual behavior that
affects the manner in which a customer is served. Positive norms are directed
toward maximizing customer satisfaction. Negative norms lead to viewing the
customer as an obstacle to be avoided. Air Force basic doctrine tells us the
Air Force’s air and space core competencies are recognized by our joint
“customers.” In other words, the total force, joint force, North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, and others rely on us to do our job to the best of our
ability. If we do not, we cannot fight and win our Nation’s wars as we are
expected to. Therefore, each organization must cultivate a culture that helps
our Airmen, Soldiers, Marines, and Sailors develop a positive customer
relations norm to ensure our Nation can meet any challenge in the most
effective manner. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">22.6.6.<b class="calibre1"> Innovativeness and Creativity. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">This group of norms determines, to a large degree, whether
original and creative behaviors are supported and encouraged. Positive norms
lead to the stimulation of new ideas and to positive change. Negative norms
support the status quo and discourage experimentation. In today’s total and
joint forces environment, we must encourage everyone to bring innovativeness
and creativity to the table in order to meet the dynamic threats that terrorism
has brought to our shores.  </p>

<p class="msonormal13">22.6.7.<b class="calibre1"> Training and Development. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">Positive norms in this group encourage training and view
development as essential to the ongoing operation. Negative norms treat
development as a nonessential, nice-to-do, but not critical aspect of the
operation. We saw firsthand during Hurricane Katrina that training is vitally
important to the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and other natural
disaster responders. In addition, Airmen are constantly training with soldiers,
sailors, and marines to ensure each branch is better equipped and prepared to
fight the global war on terrorism. </p>

<p class="msonormal11"><b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12"><b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">22.7. Why We Measure Norms:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.7.1. Understanding that norms exist, that they can be
either positive (supportive of organizational goals) or negative (incongruent
with organizational goals), and that they can be categorized drives the need to
measure those norms and develop a normative profile. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">22.7.2. In effect, a normative profile is a statement of
organizational strengths and weaknesses on a behavioral level. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">Understanding their impact on an organization’s ability to
achieve its goals, you should direct improvement programs toward changing work
group norms rather than individual behavior (as is so often the case with
organizations’ development programs). Once norms change, behavioral change
should follow. If a military member’s behavior does not support positive
organizational norms, the supervisor needs to determine the underlying reasons.
The individual’s behavior could be a result of unmet needs, a result of
discipline problems, or both. In order to be effective operational managers and
expeditionary leaders, supervisors must learn to instill positive norms to
properly motivate and discipline Airmen. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section
22C—Transactional Analysis (TA) </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">22.8. Introduction: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.8.1. "I'm OK-----You're OK" is a euphemism for
Transactional Analysis, also called TA. To some, TA is a nonverbal reaction to
communication between husband and wife or parents and children. However, TA is
much more than that and can be applied to a business, industrial, or military
organization. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.8.2. TA is a theory of personality as well as a
systematic psychotherapy for personal growth and personal change. As TA
evolves, this reaction to communication is finding a wide application in
organizations and education. TA principles and techniques is used by managers
to more fully understand themselves and their relationships with others, which
can lead to them becoming happier, healthier, and more productive. TA can be
defined by several principles, such as, Ego States, Transactions, Life
Positions, Strokes, and Time Structuring. These principles can be utilized to
form techniques to improve individual productivity that, in turn, can lead to
increased organizational effectiveness. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">22.9. Ego States: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.9.1. One area of TA is the study of individual <i class="calibre2">ego
states</i>. We all know, without being told, that we are different. The
underlying theory of TA is the highlighting of those differences. According to
Dr. Eric Berne in his book, <i class="calibre2">Games People Play, </i>TA analysis states that a
human personality is composed of ego states commonly referred to as <i class="calibre2">Parent,
Adult, </i>and <i class="calibre2">Child </i>(PAC). Each ego state is relatively separate from
the others and each has its own set of feelings, beliefs, and behavior
patterns. Generally, people act in one ego state at a time. In some cases,
people may act in two ego states at the same time. The states are produced by
the playback of recorded data of past events involving real people, real times,
real places, and real feelings. (Beme: 23-28) </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.9.2. Another expert on this subject, Dr. Thomas Harris,
does an excellent job of writing about these ego states in his book, <i class="calibre2">I'm</i>
<i class="calibre2">OK—You’re OK. </i>He says the Parent ego state is a way of thinking, acting,
feeling, and believing much the same as our parents and is based upon the
brain's recordings of our perceptions of our parents' responses. As such, the
Parent ego state responds immediately and automatically to childlike behavior.
The Parent can be a <i class="calibre2">critical </i>Parent or an overly <i class="calibre2">nurturing </i>Parent.
(Harris: 40-46) Dr. Arnold Kambly in his booklet, <i class="calibre2">The ABC's of PAC: An
Introduction to Transactional Analysis, </i>refers to the Parent as the taught
concepts of life. "We were taught this behavior from watching authority
figures in our early childhood." (Harris: I) </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.9.3. Dr. Harris says the Child ego contains our basic
desires and needs, and the recordings of the feelings and reactions of our
childhood. Oddly enough, this state develops about the same time as the Parent
state. The spontaneous dimensions of the Child provide for the joy, motivation,
and natural creativity of one's own personality. "Adopted elements of the
Child are expressed in feelings and patterns of response to parental stimuli`<b class="calibre1">
</b>responses such as rebellion, procrastination, or compliance." (Harris:
47-50) Dr. Kambly refers to this ego state as "the felt concept of life.
These are the feelings we have recorded from childhood." (Kambly: I-2)
These feelings bring forth our emotions and desires for emotion in others. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.9.4. According to Dr. Harris, the third state, the Adult
ego state, is a way of acting, feeling, and believing that is rather objective.
The Adult part of our personality develops later than either that of the Parent
or the Child, and continues to develop throughout the lifetime of a healthy person
and is the analytical part of our personality that processes current and
objective information about our environment. The Adult also edits our archaic
recordings in the Parent and Child parts of personality. (Harris: 50-59) Dr.
Kambly says the Adult deals with the realities of the world, plus input from
the Parent and Child. The Adult deals with the "here and now," in
contrast to the other two ego states which come from the past. (Kambly: 3) “The
Adult is the learned concept of life. In this case, learned in the Adult is
different than the taught of the Parent." (Kambly: 3) Learned refers to a
continuous process. The Adult is always learning. The taught Parent ego state
was taught once, in the past. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.9.5. The three ego states appear in our behavior at
different times. According to Dr. Harris, a healthy individual maintains a
balance among the three. However, some people may be dominated by one of the
ego states. This is <i class="calibre2">contamination. </i>(Harris:  123-140). According to Dr.
Kambly, "contamination takes place when the Parent or Child contaminates
the Adult." The Adult makes the decisions, but these decisions are then
distorted due to the past tapes of the Parent or Child. Dr. Harris and Dr.
Kambly agree that such people have been known to create problems for managers
who have to work with them. People with Childdominated personalities generally
do not engage in much rational problem solving. They can be hard to reason with
in emotionally charged situations because these people have learned through
earlier experiences that they can succeed by being loud, boisterous, or
emotional. Parent-dominated people also do not engage in much rational problem
solving because they already know what is right and what is wrong. They are
overly critical or overly nurturing. Another problem is <i class="calibre2">exclusion. </i>This
happens when one ego state excludes the others. In this situation, the
excluding ego state pushes out the excluded ego states. Dr. Kambly points out
that "a healthy person has the ego states separate and discrete. When
things go wrong, contamination or exclusion results." (Kambly: 45) </p>

<p class="msonormal17"><b class="calibre1">22.10. Life Position: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.10.1. Along with ego states, the term <i class="calibre2">life</i> <i class="calibre2">position
</i>is associated with TA. Simply stated, life position is how a person feels
about oneself and about other people. In the process of growing up, people make
some rather basic assumptions about themselves and about others in their
environment. The combination of assumptions about oneself and about others is
referred to as a life position. Important to state is that the life position
has two parts: the feelings of self and feelings toward others. This is
different than self-concept or self-esteem, which only deal with self. Life
positions tend to be more permanent than ego states. This permanency can create
potential problems in an organizational setting where people work together even
if their life positions are not complementary. Life positions result from
reinforcement received throughout life from expressions of need and responses
to expressed needs. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">22.10.2. The focus of the book by Dr.
Harris (<i class="calibre2">I'm</i> <i class="calibre2">OK—you’re OK) </i>is on these life positions. "The
assumptions are described in terms of "okayness." Thus, individuals
are labeled either OK or not OK, whether they refer to themselves or to someone
else. OK and not OK equate to value and individual worth. Thus, there are four
possible life positions:" (Harris: </p>

<p class="msonormal19">66) </p>

<p class="msonormal20">22.10.2.1. I'm not OK—You are not OK = neither of us has
value (- -). </p>

<p class="msonormal21">22.10.2.2. I'm not OK—You are OK = I
don't have value; you have value (- +). 22.10.2.3. I'm OK—You are not OK = I
have value; you don't have value (+ -). </p>

<p class="msonormal22">22.10.2.4. I'm OK—You are OK = We both have value (+ +). </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.10.3. The fourth life position is ideal because most
people with these feelings tend to have a positive outlook on life and are
generally successful. </p>

<p class="msonormal17"><b class="calibre1">22.11. Transactions and Strokes: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.11.1. According to Dr. Eric Heme, "a situation which
results in social intercourse is dubbed a transaction." (Beme: 29)  If two
or more people encounter each other in a social interaction, sooner or later
one of them will speak, or give some indication of acknowledging the presence
of the others. Dr. Heme calls this the <i class="calibre2">transactional stimulus</i>. Another
person says or does something related to this stimulus, and that action is
called the transactional response. Therefore, simple TA is concerned with
diagnosing which ego states are used in the transaction (stimulus and
response). Transactions may involve combinations of ego states and match or
replay forms of interactions that develop early in life. Simple transactions
are those in which both stimulus and response arise from the Adult states of
the parties concerned. These are <i class="calibre2">parallel </i>or c<i class="calibre2">omplementary. </i>Also,
Child to Parent transactions (and vice versa) is complementary. Complementary
means the responses are both appropriate and expected. Some transactions are
not complementary. The responses are not expected or appropriate. For example,
an Adult-to-Adult stimulus followed by a Child to Parent response is not
complementary and is called a <i class="calibre2">crossed </i>transaction. These occur when a
respondent reacts from an ego state other than the one desired by the
initiator. Crossed transactions can cause problems, but they also have a use as
you'll see later. Analyzing the transactions to determine the ego states can
help determine the life position. As long as transactions remain complementary,
communication continues regardless of the content of the transaction. On the
other hand, communication ceases as a result of crossed transactions. Dr.
Berne's research and experience tell us that crossed transactions are barriers
to effective communication and negatively impact the motivation of people,
which ultimately results in decreased output. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.11.2. Consider the following example: The supervisor
states, "Staff Sergeant Jones, could you come to a meeting in my office
around 1300 today?" Staff Sergeant Jones replies, "Sure." This
is an Adult transaction. Communication could continue and the supervisor could
say, "Good. I'd like you to brief that idea you submitted to the rest of
the staff I really think it will work." On the other hand, Staff Sergeant
Jones could have said, "Oh come on, I've already got enough work to do around
here. I don't want to sit through another boring meeting." In this case,
Staff Sergeant Jones is responding emotionally and not from the Adult ego
state. Therefore, effective communication is blocked. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.11.3. Another type of transaction is called a <i class="calibre2">stroke. </i>A
stroke is a special form of recognition that one person gives to another.
Strokes can <i class="calibre2">positive </i>or <i class="calibre2">negative, </i>and are common in any
organization. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.11.4. According to Dr. Kambly, positive strokes can be
verbal, nonverbal, or physical. They are designed to make the person feel good.
They are a type of reward. They can be conditional, which means they are based
on a certain condition being met. Telling a worker, "Hey Staff Sergeant
Jones, you did a great job putting together the training report." is an example
of a positive conditional stroke. Positive conditional strokes modify behavior
in that they try to get the person to continue the behavior. Positive strokes
can also be unconditional. An unconditional stroke is not based on any
condition and is given just for <i class="calibre2">being, </i>not for <i class="calibre2">doing. </i>Smiling at
someone and telling them you're glad to have them as part of the team is a
positive unconditional stroke. Positive unconditional strokes are designed to
make the person feel good about themselves. Positive unconditional strokes
improve selfesteem, which can help lead to a better life position. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.11.5. Dr. Kambly also reviews the negative<i class="calibre2"> </i>strokes
people use. Negative strokes are designed to make the person feel bad. They are
a type of punishment or rebuke. Just like positive strokes, negative stokes can
be conditional or unconditional. A negative conditional stroke is used to
modify behavior in that it is used to get the person to stop the behavior.
Issuing a reprimand or Article 15 is an example. The act (condition) resulted
in the negative conditional stroke. A negative unconditional stroke is aimed at
the person, just like the positive unconditional stroke and is an attack
against the person and not any specific behavior. Slamming a person, putting
them down, or calling them names are all examples of negative unconditional
strokes. In professional relationships, there is never a need to use negative
unconditional strokes. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.11.6. Dr. Harris identifies different stroking with the
different life positions. He has found that "people of unhealthy life
positions tend to overuse certain types of strokes." (Harris: 67- 77) For
example, an "I'm OK—You're not OK" person may overuse negative
strokes. The reason is obvious. This person thinks they are so much better than
everyone else, and they may operate from the critical Parent ego state. On the
other hand, an "I'm not OK—You're OK" person may overuse positive
strokes. This person sees others as so much better than they are. A problem
with overusing positive strokes is that the strokes become plastic or
meaningless. If the supervisor is always using them, his or her praise becomes
meaningless. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">22.12. Time Structuring. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">Another aspect of TA deals with <i class="calibre2">time structuring. </i>According
to Dr. Kambly, "if a person lives to be 75 years old, assuming he or she
sleeps 8 hours out of every 24, he or she has approximately 50 waking years to
spend in some type of time structuring." (Kambly: 9) Dr. Heme states there
are several options for a person. These are: Withdrawal, Rituals, Activities,
Pastimes, Games, and Intimacy. (Beme: 18-19) A summary of each of these, as
taken from Dr. Kambly's booklet, is below. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.12.1.<b class="calibre1"> Withdrawal.</b><i class="calibre2"> </i>This involves no risk and
has minimal social rewards because there is minimal contact. A person does not
have to be alone to be in withdrawal. They can be "lost in the
crowd." Withdrawal is not always bad. We all need to get away and relax or
be alone at times. However, if this is the primary way a person structures
their time, it becomes a problem. This can be dangerous if a person uses it all
the time. Some people can be withdrawn prior to suicide. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.12.2.<b class="calibre1"> Rituals.</b> Rituals are highly structured and
predictable ways to structure time. This can be as simple as walking down the
hall and saying, "Hi Jim. How are you today?" Jim then replies,
"Hi. I'm fine." This is done out of habit and is predictable. You may
not really care how Jim is, and Jim may not actually be "fine."
Rituals are okay at times, but if this is all a person does, this is not
productive in the work center. Rituals are just small talk about things of
little value. So, a person who spends most of their time in rituals does not
contribute as much to the work center. Rituals are slightly riskier than
withdrawal because there is some interaction. However, the risk is minimal
because of the structured and predictable nature of rituals. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.12.3.<b class="calibre1"> Activities. </b>These are goal oriented.
Activities are things people do to meet mission requirements or goals. They are
production orientated. This is where the majority of time should be spent in
the work center. People with a healthy life position can spend a lot of time in
activities and they expect others to be goal-oriented (activity-centered) also.
</p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.12.4.<b class="calibre1"> Pastimes.</b> Pastimes are ways to structure
time, such as hobbies, for relaxation. Things we do without a specific goal in
mind are all pastimes. Pastimes and activities can be confused. You need to
look at the intent of the time structuring. For example, someone playing golf
for fun is structuring their time doing a pastime. However, if they are a
professional golfer and make money at it, they are engaged in activities. The
risk is a bit higher for activities and pastimes than it is for rituals or
withdrawal because there are more chances of interaction and more chances for
values and differences of opinion to come into play. There are more meaningful
transactions during activities and pastimes. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.12.5.<b class="calibre1"> Games.</b> Games are a way to structure time in
devious or crooked ways to get strokes (which are normally negative). Games are
not productive and they result in anger, frustration, jealousy, etc. The risks
in games are high because of the anger and hurt feelings that result. Those
with unhealthy life positions normally play games. Games, like poor
communication, often tend to create organizational problems. A basic
understanding of the term <i class="calibre2">games </i>is essential to the application of TA in
management. In his book <i class="calibre2">Games People Play, </i>Dr. Berne refers to a game as
"a recurring set of transactions, often repetitious, superficially
plausible, with a concealed motivation." (Berne: 48) These types of
transactions can be of a type called <i class="calibre2">ulterior, </i>meaning there is a hidden
or ulterior meaning to the transaction. Basically, games are transactions that
are designed to cause an emotional response such as anger or hurt. A game might
be as simple as an "I'm not OK—You're OK" person speaking from the
Child ego state trying to get others to be the nurturing Parent. Some games get
more complex and can even result in death. Given this definition, games become
barriers preventing people and organizations from achieving their objectives.
Games tend to inhibit full productivity. Using crossed transactions (responding
always from your Adult when the game-player is using the Child or Parent) will
reduce game-playing. For example, assume someone says, "That's the dumbest
idea I've ever heard of. What moron came up with that?" This person is
being a critical Parent and not presenting any facts to support the point of
view. Using your Adult, you could reply, "What parts of the idea do you
find flawed?" or "Can you provide specific data to support your
opinion?" These replies use the Adult to seek facts and to focus the
person on the <i class="calibre2">here and now. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.12.6.<b class="calibre1"> Intimacy.</b> This is the most risky, but also
the most rewarding type of time structuring and is defined as a close
relationship with others free of games and exploitation. Intimacy is being
open, honest, and sincere and requires a person at the "I'm OK—You're
OK" life position. Intimacy is not just sexual relationships. A person can
have sexual relationships and be in a state of withdrawal or ritual. Intimacy
is a close personal relationship, and that's why the risk and reward are high.<b class="calibre1">
</b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">22.13. The Work Environment: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.13.1. We can now relate the concepts of TA to the
environmental process. How do basic concepts of TA apply in business,
industrial, or military environments? The most basic application of TA
principles is to managerial styles. TA is a powerful tool that can help
managers understand the interactive nature of human problems in a work
environment so<i class="calibre2"> </i>that they can deal with these problems more effectively.
Does the supervisory relationship indicate the need for a participative or an
authoritarian management style, or does the need indicate another point along
the continuum? For an authoritarian style, or <i class="calibre2">Theory X</i> management, to
work effectively, the manager has to operate as a Parent while workers operate
in the Child state. Supervisors have absolute authority while workers are very
dependent on direction from above. Thus, the boss is OK but workers are not OK.
In this situation, the manager accepts final responsibility for failure. Being
dependent, much like a Child, the worker in this situation is protected from
making a wrong decision because the boss takes full responsibility for all
actions.<i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.13.2. There is another view. According to Maslow,
Herzberg, and other motivation theorists, the authoritarian style of management
frustrates achievement of the higher-level needs of human personality.
Therefore, a worker in this situation may find it satisfactory, but may never
experience a state of self-fulfillment and growth. A common belief among casual
observers is that the condition just described is common in many organizations.
The participative or <i class="calibre2">Theory Y </i>management style involves Adult-Adult
transactions. A two-way flow of communication exists and the worker feels more
comfortable in providing his or her input. Subordinates feel a sense of responsibility
rather than a feeling of dependency. Because workers influence decisions and
share responsibility, they experience a feeling of fulfillment. The
corresponding life position is likely I'm OK—You're OK. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.13.3. A potential exists for crossed transactions in any
management setting. In the authoritarian approach, the supervisor may be
comfortable in the Parent ego state, but the worker may not enjoy the Child
state. The worker may want to operate in the Adult state, and rightfully so. In
this situation, Parent-to-Adult communication is disturbed and an unsettled
situation occurs. The worker becomes frustrated, leading to unproductive
behavior and performance—not a healthy situation for any organization. Thus, a
manager with an understanding of TA, and with knowledge of worker ego states
based on observation, could possibly head off this type of situation. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.13.4. Crossed transactions are also possible while using
a participative management style. By its very nature, this style encourages
employee ego involvement in on-the-job activities. Individuals identify closely
with work units and jobs because they are involved in establishing policies and
operating procedures. However, even in this style, instances often occur when
policies are established and decisions are rendered with rule or no employee
involvement—a simple exercise of management prerogative. Such cases provide a
fertile ground for crossed transactions when disgruntled employees confront
individual managers. Here, the potential is high for responses from the Parent
ego state, and the opportunity for conflict exists. Therefore, a skilled
manager with an understanding of TA, and with knowledge of worker ego states
based on observation, can avoid the conflict by dealing with those situations
from a complementary state. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.13.5. TA has taken hold as a supervisory tool. Initially,
it was used mainly to teach employees who deal with the public how to relate
better to their customers. Later, managers experimented with TA as a means of
improving communications within the company itself. This experimentation has
encouraged and reinforced a team concept. This is a participative management
style whereby management and workers share the responsibility for
decision-making. Some management practitioners view this as cooptation. In
other words, it gives workers an equitable "share of the pie.” The
prevailing philosophy is that workers take ownership for their behavior in
supporting policies and following procedures, which results in allowing more
focus on productivity while maintaining a high interpersonal working
relationship. In TA terms, both management and workers function in the Adult
ego state. The resulting impact of this condition on<b class="calibre1"> </b>organizations is
that the organization is OK. Overall, it can be stated, "Together we are
OK. The organization is OK = We all have value."   </p>

<p class="msonormal4">Summarizing life positions and their relationship to
management styles, one might view it in terms of a management matrix similar to
that depicted in Table 1.1. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">22.14. Conclusions:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.14.1. Generally, what has been the response to TA? Many
executives, after having been exposed to TA training, swear by it; others have
not responded as well, and consider it just another buzz word. TA is very
difficult to evaluate objectively. Most supervisors are more than willing to
prescribe TA training for line employees, but do not show much enthusiasm for
applying TA concepts to themselves. Even though there is skepticism, some
supervisors have learned that TA is profitable in terms of increasing organizational
effectiveness. It's presented here as a tool to add to your management tool
box. </p>

<p class="msonormal31">22.14.2. The application of TA tracks well with the
management theories of Likert, McGregor, and Argyris because use of TA provides
opportunities for individuals to grow and mature. Even though some workers
prefer to function in the Child state and appear to avoid responsibility, most
desire to be treated as adults and to be given more responsibility. Using TA
not only provides an opportunity for managers to know their people, but it also
helps them to get in touch with themselves. When all parties involved are aware
of each other's needs, communication improves. This condition is essential to
organizational effectiveness. The effective supervisor focuses on workers'
behavior and the modification of that behavior as a means for improving the
organizational climate, thereby ultimately increasing overall productivity. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section
22D—Performance Counseling </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">22.15. Performance Counseling. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">Performance Counseling<i class="calibre2"> </i>is<i class="calibre2"> </i>a<i class="calibre2"> </i>systematic,
two-way discussion between supervisor and subordinate concerning duty
performance as compared to established standards, with the intention of
informing the subordinate of his/her past duty performance and cooperatively
developing a plan to sustain or improve performance. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">22.16.</b> <b class="calibre1">The Lost Art of Feedback: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.16.1. The ability and willingness to communicate
effectively is the key to supervisory success. Although communication
effectiveness is based on the ability to make and maintain effective contact,
regardless of the situation, specific areas of communication require some
additional thought and planning. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.16.2. One of the most important tools for maintaining
control and developing people is the proper use feedback. Although feedback has
been categorized as positive and negative. Another way to view this is to
classify it into supportive feedback (which reinforces an ongoing behavior) and
corrective feedback (which indicates that a change in behavior is appropriate).
In this sense, all feedback is positive. The purpose of all feedback should be
to assist an individual in maintaining or enhancing his or her present level of
effectiveness or appropriateness. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.16.3. Some feedback, by definition, is better than no
feedback. There are, however, ways to do it well and ways to do it superbly.
Here are some guidelines that can help to sharpen the process. The most
important function of feedback is to help the individual who is receiving the
feedback to keep in touch with what is going on in the environment. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">22.16.4. <b class="calibre1">Supportive Feedback: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.4.1. Supportive feedback is used to reinforce
behavior that is effective and desirable. An axiom of effective supervision is
"Catch them doing something right and let them know it." (Blanchard
&amp; Johnson, 1982) </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.4.2. One of the most damaging and erroneous
assumptions that many supervisors make is that good performance and appropriate
behavior are to be expected from the employee, and that the only time feedback
is needed is when the employee does something wrong. Therefore, these
supervisors never give supportive feedback. If a supervisor was determined to
give only one kind of feedback, he or she would be ahead to choose supportive
feedback and let corrective feedback go. In other words, if a supervisor stresses
errors only, the end result would be, at most, an attempt by employees to do
standard, error free work. This accomplishment would not be bad, but there is a
better way. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.4.3. If a supervisor concentrated on what the
employees were doing well, then superior work is what the employees would
become aware of. They would begin to view their work in terms of performing as
well and as creatively as possible. What is reinforced has a tendency to become
stronger. What is not reinforced has a tendency to fade away. If excellence is
actively reinforced and errors are simply mentioned, employees will focus on
excellence and tend to reduce errors. The following example of the two types of
feedback illustrates the difference. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.4.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Focus on errors.</b><i class="calibre2"> </i>"The last
three pieces in that batch contained wrong figures. We cannot have that kind of
sloppy work in this department." </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.4.3.2.<i class="calibre2"> </i><b class="calibre1">Focus on good work<i class="calibre2">.</i></b><i class="calibre2"> </i>This
batch looks good, except for the last three pieces, which contain wrong
figures. You probably used the wrong formula. Take them back and check them
out, just the way you did the first group." </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.4.4. Fortunately, however, no one has to make a
choice between using only supportive or only corrective feedback. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.4.5. Both are essential and valuable, and it is
important to understand how each works so that the maximum gain can be received
from the process. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.16.5. <b class="calibre1">Corrective Feedback. </b>Corrective feedback is
used to alter a behavior that is ineffective or inappropriate and is essential
to the growth process as supportive feedback. A corrective feedback session,
although never hurtful if done properly, is not a particularly pleasant
experience. Under the best of circumstances, the subordinate will probably feel
a little defensive or embarrassed. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.5.1. In giving corrective feedback, the manager
should have an option ready to present. When the employee is made aware of the
inappropriate behavior, having an immediate alternative can be effective and
powerful in shaping behavior. By presenting the alternative immediately after
the corrective feedback, the manager is helping the subordinate to come out of
a personally uncomfortable situation in the shortest possible time. This
protects the dignity of the subordinate. The manager would also be establishing
himself or herself as a supporter of good work and good workers, which would go
a long way in developing strong, productive, supportive working relationships.
Also very important, the manager would be presenting an alternative that the
employee might never have considered or that was considered and rejected. This
provides for immediate learning. Most important, however, is the fact that the
manager would make the employee aware that an alternative was available at the
time the employee chose to act<b class="calibre1"> </b>otherwise. This awareness can facilitate
the employee in taking responsibility for his or her own choices. That is, the
employee would realize, "That's right, I could have done it that
way." The following example shows how an alternative can be effectively
added to the feedback. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.5.2. "When you snapped at Ann in front of the
group, she appeared to be very embarrassed and angry. When you must remind an
employee to be on time, it’s less embarrassing for everyone to discuss it with
the employee privately after the meeting." </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.16.6. <b class="calibre1">Guidelines for Effective Feedback. </b>The
following guidelines are helpful for managers who are trying to improve their
feedback skills, and may also be used as a review prior to giving feedback. </p>

<p class="msonormal32">22.16.6.1. <b class="calibre1">Deal in Specifics: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.1.1. Being specific is the most important rule in
giving feedback, whether supportive or corrective. Unless the feedback is
specific, very little learning or reinforcement is possible. The following
examples illustrate the difference in general and specific statements. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre2">General: </i>"I'm glad to see that your work is
improving." </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre2">Specific: </i>"I'm pleased that you met every
deadline in the last three weeks." </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre2">General: </i>"You're a very supportive
person."  </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre2">Specific: </i>"I appreciate you taking time to
explain the contract to our new employee." </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre2">General: </i>"You're falling down on the job
again."<i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre2">Specific: </i>"Last month most of the cost reports
were completely accurate, but last week your profit cost figures were wrong.”<i class="calibre2">
</i></p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.1.2. The last set is, of course, an example of
corrective feedback. General statements in corrective feedback frequently
result in hostile or defensive confrontations, whereas specific statements set
the stage for problem-solving interaction. Carrying the last illustration one
step farther, the manager could add an alternative: "Start checking the
typed report against the computer printouts. Some of the errors may be typos,
not miscalculations."<i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.1.3. If the employee is to learn from feedback and
respond to it, then he or she must see it in terms of <i class="calibre2">observable </i>effects.
That is, the employee must be able to see clearly how his or her behavior had a
direct impact on the group's performance, morale, etc. When the employee sees
the point of the feedback objectively, the issue will be depersonalized, and
the employee will be more willing to continue with appropriate behaviors or to
modify inappropriate behaviors. Although the manager's personal approval (“I'm
glad to see...") or disapproval ("I’m disappointed that...") can
give emphasis to feedback, it must be supported by specific data in order to
effect a change in behavior.<i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal32">22.16.6.2. <b class="calibre1">Focus on Actions, Not Attitudes:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.2.1. Just as feedback must be specific and
observable to be effective, it must be non-threatening to be acceptable.
Although subordinates, like supervisors, are always accountable for their
behavior<i class="calibre2">, </i>they are never accountable for their attitudes or feelings.
Attitudes and feelings cannot be measured, nor can a manager determine if or
when an employee's feelings have changed. For feedback to be acceptable, it
must respect the dignity of the person receiving the feedback. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.2.2. No one can attack attitudes without dealing in
generalities, and frequently attacks on attitudes result in defensive
reactions. The following example illustrates the difference in giving feedback
on behavior and giving feedback on attitudes. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.2.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Feedback on attitude:</b> "You have
been acting hostile toward Jim." </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.2.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Feedback on behavior:</b> "You threw
the papers down on Jim's desk and used profanity." </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.2.3. An attitude that managers often try to measure
is loyalty. Certain actions that seem to indicate loyalty or disloyalty can be
observed, but loyalty is a result, not an action and cannot be demanded; it
must be earned. Whereas people have total control over their own behavior, they
often exercise little control over their feelings and attitudes. They feel what
they feel. If a manager keeps this in mind and focuses more energy on things
that can be influenced (i.e. employee behavior), changes are more likely to
occur. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.2.4. The more that corrective feedback is cast in
specific behavioral terms, the more it supports problemsolving and the easier
it is to control. The more that corrective feedback is cast in attitudinal
terms, the more it will be perceived as a personal attack and the more
difficult it will be to deal with. The more that supportive feedback is cast in
terms of specific behaviors, the higher the probability that those behaviors
will be repeated and eventually become part of the person's natural way of
doing things. </p>

<p class="msonormal32">22.16.6.3. <b class="calibre1">Determine the Appropriate Time and Place:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.3.1. Feedback of either type works best if it is
given as soon as feasible after the behavior occurs. Waiting decreases the
impact that the feedback will have on the behavior. The passage of time may
make the behavior seem less important to the manager, other important events
begin to drain the energy of the manager, and some of the details of the
behavior might be forgotten. On the other hand, dwelling on it for a long
period could blow it out of proportion. From the subordinates’ viewpoint, the longer
the wait for the feedback, the less important it must be. The following example
illustrates this point. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.3.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> Tardy feedback:</b><i class="calibre2"> </i>"You fell
below your quota several times last month." </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.3.1.2.<b class="calibre1"> Immediate feedback:</b><i class="calibre2"> </i>"There
are only ten products here; your quota for today was fourteen." </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.3.2. Enough time should be allotted to deal with
the issues in their entirety. A manager can undercut feedback effectiveness by
looking at the clock and speeding up the input so that an appointment can be
met. Answering the telephone or allowing visitors to interrupt the conversation
can have the same effect. The manager can also cause unnecessary stress by
telling an employee at ten o'clock in the morning "I want to see you at three
this afternoon." A more appropriate procedure would be to say, "Would
you please come to my office now," or "When you reach a stopping
point, drop by my office. I have something good to tell you." In addition
to an appropriate time, the setting is also important. The old proverb,
"Praise in public, censure in private," is partially correct. Almost
without exception, corrective feedback is more appropriately given in private.
In the case of supportive feedback, however, discretion is needed. In many instances,
praise in public is appropriate and will be appreciated by the subordinate. In
other instances, privacy is needed to keep the positive effect from being
shortcircuited. For example, some people make a virtue out of humility; any
feedback that reinforces their sense of worth is embarrassing. Rather than
appreciating an audience, this type of employee would find it painful and
perhaps resent it. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.3.3. Sometimes a norm arises in a work group that
prevents anyone from making a big deal out of good work. This does not mean
that the group does not value good work, but supportive feedback in private
might prevent the employee from feeling he or she was responsible for breaking
the norm. In other instances, public praise can cause jealousy, hostility, or
tense working relationships. Therefore, a conscious decision should be made
about whether or not to give the supportive feedback publicly. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.3.4. Another important consideration is the actual
location selected for giving the feedback. The delivery of the feedback should
match its importance. If the feedback concerns an important action, the
manager's office would be better than an accidental encounter in the hall. On
the other hand, the manager might convey a quick observation by telling someone
at the water fountain, "Say that was beautiful artwork on the Madison
report." Choosing the time and place is a matter of mixing a little common
sense with an awareness of what is going on. </p>

<p class="msonormal32">22.16.6.4. <b class="calibre1">Refrain from Inappropriately Including Other
Issues: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.4.1. Frequently when feedback is given, other
issues interfere. When supportive feedback is given, any topic that does not
relate to the specific feedback point should not be discussed if it would
undercut the supportive feedback. For example, the manager could destroy the
good just accomplished by adding, "And by the way, as long as you are
here, I want to ask you to try to keep your files a little neater. While you
were away, I couldn't find a thing." </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.4.2. When corrective feedback is given, however,
the situation is different. The manager will want the feedback to be absorbed
as quickly and easily as possible, with the employee's negative feelings
lasting no longer than necessary. Therefore, as soon as the feedback has been
understood and acknowledged, the manager is free to change the subject. The
manager may want to add, "I'm glad that you see where the error occurred.”
</p>

<p class="msonormal33">22.16.6.4.3. “Now, as long as you are here, I'd like to ask
your opinion about ..." This type of statement, when used appropriately,
lets the subordinate know that he or she is still valued. Obviously, the
manager should not contrive a situation just to add this type of statement, but
when the situation is naturally there, the manager is free to take advantage of
it. </p>

<p class="msonormal33">22.16.6.4.4. In certain situations, it is appropriate to
give supportive and corrective feedback simultaneously. Training periods of new
employees, performance-appraisal sessions, and times when experienced employees
are tackling new and challenging tasks are all good examples of times when both
types of feedback are appropriate. Nevertheless, some cautions are necessary. </p>

<p class="msonormal33">22.16.6.4.5. Never follow the feedback with the word
"but." It will negate everything that was said before it. If
appropriate to give supportive and corrective feedback within the same
sentence, the clauses should be connected with "and." This method
allows both parts of the sentence to be heard clearly and sets the stage for a
positive suggestion. The following examples illustrate the difference. </p>

<p class="msonormal33">22.16.6.4.5.1. Connected with but: "Your first report
was accurate, but your others should have measured up to it." </p>

<p class="msonormal22">22.16.6.4.5.2. Connected with and: "Your first report
was accurate, and your others should have measured up to it." </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.4.5.3. Connected with but: "You were late this
morning, but Anderson called to tell you what a great job you did on the Miller
account." </p>

<p class="msonormal33">22.16.6.4.5.4. Connected with and: "You were late this
morning, and Anderson called to tell you what a great job you did on the Miller
account." </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.4.6. Alternate the supportive and corrective
feedback. Better to mix the supportive feedback with the corrective feedback
than to give all of one type and then all of the other when a great deal of
feedback must be given. Regardless of which type comes first, the latter will
be remembered the most clearly. If a chronic self-doubter is first given
supportive feedback and then only corrective feedback, he or she is likely to
believe the supportive feedback was given just to soften the blow of the other
type. Alternating between the two types will make all the feedback seem more
genuine. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.6.4.7. Where feasible, use the supportive feedback to
cushion the corrective feedback. When both types of feedback are appropriate,
there is usually no reason to start with corrective feedback. However, this
does not mean that corrective feedback should be quickly sandwiched in between
supportive feedback statements. Each type is important, but frequently
supportive feedback can be used as an excellent teaching device for areas that
need correcting. This is especially true if the employee has done a good job
previously and then failed later under similar circumstances. For example, the
manager might say, "The way you helped Fred to learn the codes when he was
transferred to this department would be appropriate in training the new
employees." </p>

<p class="msonormal13">22.16.7. <b class="calibre1">Principles of Feedback:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.7.1. Two major principles govern the use of feedback.
The first principle, which relates to how feedback is conducted, can be
paraphrased, "I can't tell you how you are, and you can't tell me what I
see." In other words, the person giving the feedback is responsible to
relate the situation as he or she observes it, and the person receiving the
feedback is responsible for relating what he or she meant, felt, or thought.
The second principle is that feedback supports growth. Let's define what is
meant by "I can't tell you how you are, and you can't tell me what I
see." </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.7.1.1.<b class="calibre1"> Receiving Feedback</b><i class="calibre2">: </i>"You
Can't Tell Me How I Am." </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.7.1.1.1. From the recipient's viewpoint, the first
principle is "You can't tell me how I am, and I can't tell you what you
see." Although most people realize that giving feedback correctly requires
skill and awareness, they are less aware of the importance of knowing how to
receive feedback. When receiving feedback, many people tend to argue about,
disown, or attempt to justify the information. Statements like "I didn't
say that," "That's not what I meant," and "You don't
understand what I was trying to do," are attempts to convince the person
giving the feedback that he or she didn't see or observe what he or she claims.
However, the recipient needs to understand that the observer, whether manager,
peer, or subordinate, is relating what he or she experienced as a result of the
recipient's behavior. There is nothing wrong with the giver and receiver having
different viewpoints. The purpose of feedback is to give a new<b class="calibre1"> </b>view or
to increase awareness. If an argument ensues and the observer backs down, the
recipient is the loser. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.7.1.2.<b class="calibre1"> Giving Feedback:</b><i class="calibre2"> </i>"You Can't
Tell Me What I See." </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.7.1.2.1. The object of giving feedback is not to
judge the other person, but to report what was seen and heard and what the
effects of the behavior were. Personal approval or disapproval, even if
important, is secondary. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.7.1.2.2. Feedback should be given directly to the
person for whom it is intended. When others are present, the manager sometimes
addresses them almost to the exclusive of the intended recipient, who sits
quietly and gathers information by eavesdropping. Good contact with the
recipient is an essential element in giving feedback. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.7.1.2.3. Never apologize for giving corrective
feedback. Corrective or otherwise, feedback is a gift; apologies will discount
the importance and lessen the impact. Nevertheless, corrective feedback must be
given in a way that does not jeopardize the recipient's dignity and sense of
self-worth. </p>

<p class="msonormal34">22.16.7.1.2.4. To offer an interpretation of the behavior
or a hunch about what the behavior might indicate is sometimes more helpful.
Crucially important is to offer the interpretation as a suggestion and never as
a judgment or clinical evaluation of the person. Only the recipient is capable
of putting it into a meaningful context. For example, the manager might say,
"When Pete showed you the error you made; you told him it was none of his
concern. I wonder if you were mad at Pete for some other reason." This
statement shows the recipient the behavior and allows him or her to consider a
possible cause for that behavior. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.7.1.2.5. The appropriate response, as a rule of
thumb, is to say “thank you” when either type of feedback is received. Also
appropriate of course is to ask for clarity or more detail on an issue. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.7.1.2.6. The purpose of feedback is to help the
recipient. Feedback can be thought of as food which is very nourishing. When
people are hungry, food is what they need. But when they are full, food is the
last thing they want or need. The same applies to ingesting feedback. When
people have had enough, they should call a halt. Attempting to absorb all the
feedback that might be available, or that various people would like to give, is
like forcing food into a full stomach just because someone says, “Please have
some more.” </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.7.1.2.7. The recipient is responsible for demanding
specificity in feedback. No feedback should be accepted as legitimate if it
cannot be clearly demonstrated by an observable behavior. For example, if
someone says, "You're very arrogant," an appropriate response would
be "What specifically have I said or done to cause you to think that?"
If that response is countered with "I don't know; I just experience you
that way," then the accusation should be immediately forgotten. People
cannot afford to change just to meet everyone's personal likes or expectations.
</p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.7.1.2.8. In fact, what is impossible is to change to
meet everyone's expectations, and the situation becomes compounded as more and
more people give their feedback. A single act can generate disparate feedback
from different people who observe the behavior. For example, a loud exclamation
could be viewed as appropriately angry by one person, overly harsh by another,
and merely uncouth by a third. Each person will see it from his or her unique
perspective. Therefore, feedback requires action from both the giver and the
receiver. Only the giver can tell what he or she observed or experienced, and
only the recipient can use the information in deciding whether or not to change
the behavior. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.7.1.2.9. For feedback to be effective, the receiver
must hear what the giver is saying, weigh it, and then determine whether or not
the information is relevant. The following example illustrates how this can be
done. </p>

<p class="msonormal20"><b class="calibre1">Department manager: </b>"Waste in your unit is up
by four percent. Are you having any problems with your employees?" </p>

<p class="msonormal33"><b class="calibre1">Supervisor: </b>"I was not aware of the waste
increase. No, I am not having trouble with my employees. I suppose I have been
focusing on the quality so much that I lost sight of the waste figures. Thanks
for bringing this to my attention." </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.7.2. <b class="calibre1">Feedback Supports Growth. </b>The second major
principle, "feedback supports growth," is important because we cannot
always see ourselves as others see us. Although an individual may be the
world’s foremost authority on himself or herself, there are still parts of the
individual that are more obvious to other people. Although people may be more
aware of their own needs and capabilities and more concerned about their own
welfare than other people are, they are able to stretch themselves and grow if
they pay attention to feedback from others. Although feedback may be extremely
uncomfortable at the time, the individual can look back later and realize the
feedback was the spark that inspired the change that turned his or her career
or personal life in a different direction. If the feedback is not rejected or
avoided, recipients can discover and develop ways to work that they did not
think were available. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">22.16.8. <b class="calibre1">Feedback Strategies:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal33">22.16.8.1. The strategies suggested here are not
step-by-step procedures to be blindly followed. Their purpose is to help in
planning and organizing an approach to deal with an issue. They offer a logical
and effective sequence of events for the feedback session. The person planning
the session must decide on the desired future objective. (The future<i class="calibre2">, </i>however,
could be five minutes after the session or two years later.) During the
feedback session, attention must be focused on what is happening in terms of
the outcome. That is, the focus must be on obtaining the goal, not on sticking
to the strategy. This focus allows the giver to change tactics or even modify
the original strategy if conditions change or unforeseen events occur. After
the strategy is selected, the following three rules should be kept in mind: </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.8.1.1. Be clear about what you want in terms of
specific, identifiable outcomes for yourself, your subordinate, and the
organization. </p>

<p class="msonormal33">22.16.8.1 2. Plan what you intend to say and how you intend
to conduct the meeting, according to the particular strategy you will use. </p>

<p class="msonormal33">22.16.8.1.3. Have the strategy in mind as you engage the
individual, but keep it in the background. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">22.16.8.2. <b class="calibre1">Supportive Feedback Strategy.</b> The
following steps are suggested as a strategy for supportive feedback: </p>

<p class="msonormal35">22.16.8.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Acknowledge the
specific action to be reinforced. </b>Immediately let the subordinate know that
you are pleased about something he or she did. Be specific and describe the
event in behavioral terms. "You finished the project </p>

<p class="msonormal22">(action) on time (result)." </p>

<p class="msonormal33">22.16.8.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Explain the effects of the accomplishment
and state your appreciation.</b><i class="calibre2"> </i>For the behavior to be reinforced, the
person must be able to see the effects of that behavior in specific, observable
ways. Your appreciation is important, but as an additional reinforcing element.
The main reinforcement is the effect. "It was a major factor in securing
the contract (effect), and I am pleased with your outstanding work
(appreciation)." </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.8.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Help the subordinate to take full
responsibility for the success.</b><i class="calibre2"> </i>If the employee acknowledges the
feedback, this step is accomplished. If the employee seems overly modest, more
work is needed. Unless he or she can, to some degree, internalize the success
and receive satisfaction from it, very little growth will occur. One approach
would be to ask how the success was accomplished or if any problems were
encountered and how they were overcome. In talking about what happened, the
employee is likely to realize how much he or she was really responsible for.
What is important is for both you and the employee to hear how the success was
accomplished. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.8.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Ask if the subordinate wants to talk about
anything else.</b> While the employee is feeling positive and knows that you
are appreciative and receptive, he or she may be willing to open up about other
issues. The positive energy created by this meeting can be directed toward
other work related issues, so take advantage of the opportunity. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.8.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Thank the subordinate for the good
performance</b>. The final step, again thanking the subordinate for the
accomplishment, assures that your appreciation will be uppermost in his or her
mind as he or she leaves and returns to the work setting. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">22.16.9. <b class="calibre1">Corrective Feedback Strategy. </b>The following
steps are suggested as a strategy for corrective feedback. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.9.1. <b class="calibre1">Immediately describe the event in behavioral
terms and explain the effect</b>. Clearly relate in specific, observable, and
behavioral terms the nature of the failure or behavior and the effect of the
failure or behavior on the work group or organization. If you can appropriately
say something to reduce the employee's embarrassment, the employee is more
likely to accept the feedback non-defensively. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.9.2. <b class="calibre1">Ask what happened.</b><i class="calibre2"> </i>Before assuming
that the subordinate is at fault, ask what happened. In many instances, the
subordinate is not at fault or is only partially responsible. At worst, the
employee is given an opportunity to explain before you proceed; at best, you
may receive information that would prevent you from censuring the employee. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.9.3. <b class="calibre1">Help the subordinate to take full
responsibility for the actions.</b><i class="calibre2"> </i>The more time spent in step 2
(finding out what happened), the easier step 3 will be. The subordinate needs
to learn from the experience in order to reduce the probability of a reoccurrence.
Unless this step is handled effectively, the subordinate will see himself or
herself as a victim, rather than as someone who made a mistake and is willing
to correct it. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.9.4. <b class="calibre1">Develop a plan to deal with the issues.</b><i class="calibre2">
</i>Once the subordinate has accepted responsibility, the next step is to help
rectify the situation. Now that the employee is willing to be accountable for
errors, you can collaboratively devise a plan that will help eliminate them.
That is, both of you must agree to take action. If you each want the same
thing, such as better performance from the subordinate, then both of you are
obligated to do something about it. This is also an excellent opportunity to
build on the subordinate's strengths (e.g., "I’d like for you to show the same
fine attention to safety regulations that you show to job
specifications.") </p>

<p class="msonormal6">22.16.9.5.<b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2"> </i>State your confidence in the
subordinate's ability</b>.<i class="calibre2"> </i>Once the issue is resolved, end the session
by stating your confidence in the ability of the employee to handle the situation.
The object is to allow the subordinate to reenter the work setting feeling as
optimistic about his or her self as the situation permits. The subordinate must
also understand that you will follow up and give additional feedback when the
situation warrants. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">22.17. Conclusion. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal36">Remember, the concept of power in the workforce usually has
a negative connotation. It brings to mind such associations as coercion,
manipulation, and even corruption. This does not have to be the case. Power has
many positive aspects, and everyone can learn to explore and harness different
sources of the individual power they have in the workplace. Develop your own
sources of power, and employees will be less dependent on others for the
leadership they need. Thus, if you want to do more good for yourself and more
good for the people around you, it is important to learn how to tap into your
own points of power.</p>

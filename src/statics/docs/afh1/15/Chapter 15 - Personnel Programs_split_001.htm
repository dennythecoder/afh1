<p class="msonormal76">When
a military family experiences a crisis, the American Red Cross is there to
assist by providing emergency communications 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
The American Red Cross relays urgent messages containing accurate, factual,
complete and verified descriptions of the emergency to service members
stationed anywhere in the world, including ships at sea, embassies and remote
locations. American Red Cross emergency communications services keep military
personnel in touch with their families following the death or serious illness
of an immediate family member, the birth of a service memberâ€™s child or
grandchild or when a family experiences other emergencies. </p>

<p class="msonormal77">No
matter where a military member and their family are stationed, they can rest
assured the American Red Cross will deliver their notifications in times of
crisis. Even if the service member receives notification of an emergency
through an e-mail or a phone call, American Red Cross-verified information
assists commanding officers in making a decision regarding emergency leave.
Without this verification, the service member may not be able to come home
during a family emergency. </p>

First Aid for Military Families was developed out of the American Red Crossâ€™s
continuing commitment to serve military families. This course was designed
specifically for the spouses, parents, siblings, and significant others of
service members. This Red Cross service provides useful information on how to
strengthen your ability to successfully respond to the challenges that military
family members may encounter throughout the deployment cycle. It also explains
how to provide psychological first aid to others experiencing stressful
feelings or events. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section
15A—Overview </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">15.1. Introduction. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">15.1.1. The Air Force requires military members to
be prepared to serve and support the mission at all times. Force support
organizations ensure Airmen and their families are cared for, pay and
entitlements are properly addressed, and their individual rights are secure.
Airmen need to comprehend the enlisted assignments, family care, reenlistment
and retraining opportunities, benefits and services, personnel records and
individual rights, the awards and decorations program, and the enlisted
promotion systems programs and policies. Each of these areas has an impact, in
some form or fashion, on every Airman; therefore, understanding the individual
nuances associated with each of these programs is a necessity for all Airmen.
The senior NCO promotion program, manpower management and requirements,
competitive sourcing, and civilian personnel management programs, are all
necessary areas of focus for our aspiring senior NCOs. A basic understanding of
these subject areas are required to effectively lead Airmen and manage
programs. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">15.1.2. The Air Force mission requires military
members to be prepared for service at all times. Mission support organizations
ensure Airmen's families are cared for; pay and entitlements are properly
addressed; and individual rights are secured. This chapter includes information
on enlisted assignments, family care, reenlistment and retraining
opportunities, benefits and services, personnel records, individual rights, the
awards and decorations program, and the enlisted promotion system. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section
15B—Enlisted Assignments </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.2.</b> <b class="calibre1">General Information. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7">Qualified Airmen must be in the right jobs at the
right time to accomplish the Air Force mission. The Air Force classifies and
assigns Airmen worldwide as equitably as possible to ensure a high state of
readiness. The Air Force also recognizes a need for special assignment
considerations to take care of Air Force Airmen with exceptional needs. The Air
Force uses a coherent and logical classification system to identify valid
manpower requirements, to identify and describe each Air Force occupational
specialty, to ensure minimum prerequisite standards are set for each specialty,
and to ensure qualified Airmen are placed into each specialty. While the
primary consideration in selecting Airmen for reassignment is the Airmen’s
qualifications to accomplish the mission, the Air Force also considers
additional factors: </p>

<p class="msonormal8">15.2.1. To the maximum extent possible, the Air Force
assigns Airmen on a voluntary basis and in the most equitable manner feasible. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">15.2.2. The Air Force equitably distributes involuntary
assignments among similarly qualified Airmen to minimize family separation and
to avoid creating a severe personal hardship on Airmen. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">15.2.3. Limitations may be established on
involuntary selection for permanent change of station following some temporary
duties to allow Airmen to attend essential military and personal pre-permanent
change of station requirements, as well as to reduce Airmen and family
turbulence. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.3. Assignment Authority.</b>  </p>

<p class="msonormal9">The Department of Defense allocates funds,
delegates authority, and directs policies for the permanent change of station
assignment of Airmen to satisfy national security requirements. Permanent
change of station assignments may also be directed to ensure equitable
treatment of Airmen, such as permanent change of station from overseas to the
continental United States upon completion of the prescribed overseas tour. Air
Force Instruction 36-2110, <i class="calibre2">Assignments,</i> is the governing instruction for
operational (including rotational), training (including formal education and
professional military education) and force structure assignments.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Assignment Requests.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">The director of assignments (or equivalent) in
coordination with major commands, field operating agencies, and direct
reporting units is authorized to initiate assignments for Airmen currently
assigned to major commands, field operating agencies, or direct reporting units
to fill valid vacant manpower authorizations. Air Force Personnel Center is the
final approval authority for Airman assignments. The Airman Assignment Division
is the final approval authority for Airman assignments in the grades of Senior
Master Sergeant and below. The Chiefs Group is the final approval authority for
Chief Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant-select assignments.  </p>

<p class="msonormal12"> </p>

<p class="msonormal13"> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Distribution of Personnel. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal14">Airmen are distributed to meet the overall needs of
the Air Force according to law and Department of Defense and Air Force
directives and instructions; as equitably as possible between major commands,
within a specialty and grade; according to guidance from the Air Staff
functional area office of primary responsibility; and as directed by the
designated assignment authority outlined in AFI 36-2110. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.4. Assignment Policy and Procedures: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.4.1.<b class="calibre1"> Equal Opportunity.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal11">The Air Force assigns Airmen without regard to color,
race, religious preference (except chaplains), national origin, ethnic
background, age, marital status (except military couples), spouse’s employment,
education or volunteer service activities of spouse, or gender (except as
provided for by statute or other policies). This applies to both permanent
change of station and temporary duty assignments. The primary factor in
selecting Airmen for permanent change of station is the Airmen’s qualifications
to fill a valid manpower requirement and perform productively in the position
for which being considered. When Airmen with the required qualifications are
identified, then permanent change of station eligibility criteria and other
factors are considered.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> Special Experience Identifier.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal15">The special experience identifier system
complements the assignment process and is used in conjunction with grade, Air
Force specialty code, Air Force specialty code prefixes and suffixes, etc., to
match uniquely qualified Airmen to jobs with special requirements. Special
experience identifiers may be used when specific experience or training is
critical to the job, and no other means is appropriate or available. The
special experience identifier system is also used to rapidly identify Airmen to
meet unique circumstances, contingency requirements, or other critical needs.
Manpower positions are coded with a special experience identifier to identify
positions that require or provide unique experiences or qualifications. The
personnel records for the Airmen who earn a special experience identifier are
similarly coded.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.4.3. <b class="calibre1">Security Access Requirement.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">Manpower positions often require Airmen assigned to
have access to a specified level of classified information. However, sometimes
the urgency to fill a position does not allow selection of Airmen using
permanent change of station eligibility criteria and subsequent processing
(and/or investigation) for access at the specified level. Under these
circumstances, selection may be necessary from among Airmen who currently have
access or can be granted access immediately. <b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.4.4.<b class="calibre1"> Grade, Air Force Specialty Code, and Skill-Level
Relationship for Assignment.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal17">Chief Master Sergeants and Chief Master
Sergeant-selects may be assigned in any Air Force specialty code or chief
enlisted manager code they possess or are qualified to be awarded. Normally,
Airmen in the grade of Senior Master Sergeants and below are selected for
assignment in their control Air Force specialty code. Airmen with an
incompatible grade and control Air Force specialty code skill level because of
retraining or reclassification are selected for assignment and allocated
against requirements commensurate with their grade, regardless of their control
Air Force specialty code skill level. Normally, Airmen are selected based on
their grade and skill level. Chief Master Sergeants fill chief enlisted manager
code positions; Senior Master Sergeants fill 9-skill level positions; Master
Sergeants and Technical Sergeants fill 7-skill level positions; Staff Sergeants
and Senior Airman fill 5-skill level positions; and Airman First Class, Airman,
and Airman Basic fill 3-skill level positions. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.4.5. <b class="calibre1">Volunteer Status and Permanent Change of Station
Eligibility.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal18">Within a group of qualified Airmen who meet the
minimum eligibility criteria for permanent change of station selection,
volunteers are selected ahead of nonvolunteers. Furthermore, nonvolunteers
qualified to fill a requirement who meet the minimum permanent change of
station eligibility criteria are selected ahead of qualified volunteers who do
not meet permanent change of station eligibility criteria. For example, time on
station is a permanent change of station eligibility requirement. A qualified
volunteer who meets the minimum time on station requirement is considered first
in order of longest on station. Next, the qualified nonvolunteer who meets the
time on station requirement in the order of longest on station, and finally the
qualified volunteer who does not meet the time on station requirement may be
considered; however, qualified volunteer will require a time on station waiver.
</p>

<p class="msonormal19"> </p>

<p class="msonormal12"> </p>

<p class="msonormal13"> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.4.6. <b class="calibre1">Chief Master Sergeant Development. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Headquarters Air Force/DPE uses the Chief Master
Sergeant assignment policies to support the continued development of Chief
Master Sergeants. Because Chief Master Sergeants are Air Force senior leaders,
these policies are comparable with other senior leader assignment and
development methods. Policies include: </p>

<p class="msonormal17">15.4.6.1.<b class="calibre1"> Three-year Limits for Headquarters
Staff and Special Duty Tours. </b>Chief Master Sergeants serving in major
command, Headquarters Air Force, and Joint Staff positions, as well as special
duty positions will be limited to serving 3-year tours. This increases the
opportunities for Chief Master Sergeants to serve in these positions, enhancing
their development. Additionally, this improves the flow of field experience
into headquarters staff positions and staff experience into base-level units. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">15.4.6.2.<b class="calibre1"> Date Eligible for Return from Overseas
(DEROS) Management. </b>DEROS adjustment requests, like DEROS extensions,
indefinite DEROSs, and in-place consecutive overseas tours, are closely
scrutinized for Chief Master Sergeants and only considered if in the best
interest of the Air Force and supportive of Chief Master Sergeant development.
Subsequently, DEROS adjustments are not routinely approved for Chief Master
Sergeants.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal21">15.4.6.3.<b class="calibre1"> Home-Basing Requests. </b>In addition
to closely scrutinizing DEROS adjustment requests, the Chiefs Group also uses
the same criteria to review home-basing requests, which are also not routinely
approved. The same rationale used in paragraph 15.4.6.2 applies. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">15.4.6.4.<b class="calibre1"> Nominative Selection for
Strategic-Level Assignments. </b>Specific strategic-level assignments such as
Air Force career field managers and command Chief Master Sergeants are filled
using a nominative selection process. The hiring authority for these positions
requests nominations from appropriate organizations, frequently each major
command. Each organization then identifies their most qualified Chief Master
Sergeants for the advertised position and nominates them to the hiring
authority. The hiring authority then selects the best Airman for the job. This
highly competitive process ensures a significant level of visibility and senior
leader involvement in selecting Chief Master Sergeants to serve in these top
positions. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">15.4.6.5.<b class="calibre1"> Command Chief Master Sergeant Assignments. </b>Command
Chief Master Sergeant assignments are        2-year minimum and 3-year maximum
tours. This ensures an appropriate balance between fresh enlisted leadership
and leadership stability within organizations. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.4.7. <b class="calibre1">First-Term Airmen.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal14">First-Term Airmen serving an initial enlistment of
4 or more years may not be given more than two assignments in different
locations following initial basic and skill training during their first 4 years
of service, regardless of tour length. First-Term Airmen who make two permanent
change of station moves are permitted an additional permanent change of station
in conjunction with an approved humanitarian reassignment or a join spouse
assignment, as a volunteer, or when the permanent change of station is a
mandatory move. Low-cost moves are excluded from the two-move count. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">15.4.8.<b class="calibre1"> Availability and
Deferment. </b>Airmen are considered available for reassignment on the first
day of the “availability” month. Deferments may be authorized, when possible in
most grades and Air Force specialty codes, to maintain an equitable assignment
system and also support the need for stability in certain organizations or
functions. The reasons for deferments vary. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">Deferments are normally approved to preclude an
Airman’s permanent change of station while suitability to remain on Regular Air
Force is evaluated or during a period of observation or rehabilitation.
Deferments also exist for such things as completion of an educational program
or degree, witness for a court-martial, accused in a court-martial, control
roster, Article 15 punishment, base of preference program, retraining, humanitarian
reasons, etc. AFI 362110 contains a complete list of deferments.  </p>

<p class="msonormal18">15.4.8.1. <b class="calibre1">Humanitarian Reassignment, Expedited
Transfers and Exceptional Family Member Program Reassignment or Deferment.</b>
Policies and procedures concerning humanitarian reassignment, Expedited
Transfers and Exceptional Family Member Program reassignment or deferment are
outlined in AFI 36-2110. These policies and procedures include but are not
limited to: </p>

<p class="msonormal15">15.4.8.1.1. The Humanitarian Program provides
reassignment or deferment for Airmen to help them resolve severe short-term
problems involving a family member. The problem must be resolvable within a
reasonable period of time (normally 12 months); the Airman’s presence must be
considered absolutely essential to resolve the problem; and the Airman must be
effectively utilized in his or her control Air Force specialty code at the new
assignment. Family members under the humanitarian program are limited to
spouse, children, parents, parents-in-law, and those people who have served “in
loco parentis.” A person “in loco parentis” refers to one who has exercised
parental rights and responsibilities in place of a natural parent for at least
5 years before the Airman’s or spouse’s 21st birthday, or before the Airman’s
entry to the Regular Air Force, whichever is earlier. While brothers and
sisters are not included in the definition of family member for humanitarian
consideration, a request involving a brother’s or sister’s terminal illness
will be considered as an exception to policy. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">15.4.8.1.2. The<span class="calibre3"> </span>Exceptional Family Member Program is a separate and distinct
program from humanitarian policy. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">The Exceptional Family Member Program is based on
an Airman’s need for special medical or educational care for a spouse or child
that is required long term, possibly permanently. Therefore, this program is
not a base-of-choice program, as assignment decisions are based on manning
needs of the Air Force at locations where the special medical or educational
needs for a spouse or child can be met. The Air Force’s commitment and
responsibilities under the Exceptional Family Member Program requires mandatory
enrollment and identification of exceptional family members. Under the
Exceptional Family Member Program, an Airman may receive a reassignment if a need
arises for specialized care that cannot be met where currently assigned. A
deferment from an assignment may be provided for a newly identified condition
if the Airman’s presence is considered essential. The purpose of such a
deferment is to allow the Airman time to establish a special medical treatment
program or educational program for the exceptional family member. When granted,
the initial period of deferment is usually 12 months, after which an Airman may
be reconsidered for permanent change of station, if otherwise eligible. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">15.4.8.1.3. Expedited Transfers are a separate and
distinct program from the humanitarian policy and applies to only </p>

<p class="msonormal18">Regular Air Force members who are sexually
assaulted and file an unrestricted report. The Airman may request an Expedited
Transfer with assistance from the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response
Office. If an Airman is the victim of stalking or other sexual misconduct (i.e.
indecent viewing, visual recording, or broadcasting; forcible pandering;
indecent exposure) and files a report, the Airman may also request an expedited
transfer with assistance from the Victim and Witness Assistance Program in the
installation’s Legal Office. An expedited transfer request initiated on behalf
of another will not be accepted. Only exception applies to the vice wing
commander applying on behalf of the alleged offender. To enhance protection for
the sexual assault victim, potential reassignment of the alleged offender shall
be considered by the vice wing commander (or equivalent), balancing interests
of the sexual assault victim and the alleged offender. An Airman (victim or
alleged offender) will generally only be delayed from departing permanent
change of station when they are required to remain for completion of a criminal
or disciplinary investigation or action in which they are the subject. All
assignment action codes must be removed from the Airman’s personnel file in
order to facilitate permanent change of station eligibility. Retraining or
cross-flow actions will be considered under this program on a case by case
basis as the goal for transferring the Airman is a timely reassignment with
minimal disruption to an Airman’s career and family. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">15.4.8.2.<b class="calibre1"> Base of Preference (Enlisted Only).</b>
The first-term Airmen base of preference program is a reenlistment incentive.
The Career Airman base of preference program is an incentive for other Airmen
to continue an Air Force career. First-term Airmen in conjunction with
reenlistment or retraining may request a permanent change of station from
continental United States-to-continental United States or permanent change of
station from overseas-tocontinental United States. First-term Airmen in the
continental United States (only) may request a base of preference to remain in
place. A permanent change of station base of preference is not authorized from
continental United States-to-overseas or overseas-to-overseas. An in-place base
of preference is not authorized for Airmen assigned overseas. Career Airmen may
request a base of preference to remain in place at a continental United States
location or a permanent change of station base of preference for continental
United States-to-continental United States assignment.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal21">15.4.8.3. <b class="calibre1">Assignment of Military Couples (Join
Spouse). </b>Each Airman of a military couple serves in his or her own right.
This means military couples must fulfill the obligations inherent to all
Airmen. They are considered for assignments to fill valid manning requirements
and must perform duties that require the skills in which they are trained.
Provided these criteria are met, military couples may be considered for
assignments where they can maintain a joint residence. Military couples share
the responsibility for reducing family separation. They should not make
decisions on future service, career development, or family planning based on
the assumption they will always be assigned to the same location or that join
spouse assignment is guaranteed.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">15.4.8.4. <b class="calibre1">Voluntary Stabilized Base Assignment
Program (Enlisted Only).</b> The Voluntary Stabilized Base Assignment Program
provides Airmen a stabilized tour in exchange for volunteering for an
assignment to a historically hard-to-fill location. Application procedures are
listed in AFI 36-2110.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">15.4.8.5.<b class="calibre1"> Extended Long Overseas Tour Length. </b>The
extended long overseas tour volunteer program applies to Airmen who volunteer
for permanent change of station overseas to a long-tour location (one where the
accompanied tour length is 24 months or more, and the unaccompanied tour length
is more than 15 months). Airmen who volunteer for an extended long overseas
tour agree to serve the standard tour length plus an additional 12 months. Tour
lengths for various overseas locations are listed in the Joint Travel
Regulation, Volume 1, Appendix Q. Extended long overseas tour volunteers are
considered ahead of standard overseas tour volunteers according to the
priorities shown in AFI 36-2110. The 12-month extended tour period is in
addition to the normal (accompanied or unaccompanied) long tour length the
Airman must serve. A change in status affects the service retainability that
must be obtained and the tour length the Airman will be required to serve. The
requirement for additional service retainability may require an Airman to
extend or reenlist and could affect selective reenlistment bonus calculation. </p>

<p class="msonormal21">15.4.8.6.<b class="calibre1"> Educational Deferment.</b> Airmen who
have not yet been selected for a permanent change of station may request
deferment from assignment selection when they have nearly completed a
vocational program or college degree requirements. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">15.4.8.7. <b class="calibre1">High School Senior Assignment Deferment
Program.</b> The High School Senior Assignment Deferment Program allows Senior
Master Sergeants and below and officers through Lieutenant Colonel to apply for
a 1-year assignment deferment. Back-to-back deferments may be possible and
military-married-to-military spouses may also apply. As in all situations,
however, the needs of the Air Force will come first and will be the determining
factor in granting deferments. Requests will be considered on a case-by-case
basis, and deferments will be approved where possible. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">15.4.8.8. <b class="calibre1">Temporary Duty.</b> AFI 36-2110
provides instructions regarding temporary duty procedures. The maximum
temporary duty period at any one location in a 12-month period is 180 days
unless the Secretary of the Air Force grants a waiver. To the degree possible,
Airmen are not selected for involuntary overseas permanent change of station
while performing certain kinds of temporary duty. Additionally, if selected for
involuntary permanent change of station after one of these temporary duties,
the report no later than date will not be within 120 days of the temporary duty
completion date.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal15">15.4.8.9.<b class="calibre1"> Dependent Care and Adoption.</b> All
Airmen ensure dependent care arrangements are made when they are separated
because of temporary duty or permanent change of station. Military couples with
dependents and single Airmen sponsors are expected to fulfill their military
obligations on the same basis as other Airmen. They are eligible for worldwide
duty and all assignments for which they qualify. To ensure all Airmen remain
available for worldwide duty, they must have workable plans to provide
parent-like care for their dependents as outlined in AFI 36-2908,<i class="calibre2"> Family
Care Plans</i>. Airmen who cannot or will not meet military commitments due to
family needs will be considered for discharge. Airmen adopting children are
given a limited time to complete the official adoption process and facilitate
bonding. Airmen may be authorized deferment during the 6-month period following
the date a child is officially placed in the Airmen’s home. Airmen may also be
authorized up to 21 days of permissive temporary duty that can be used in
conjunction with ordinary leave.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">15.4.9. <b class="calibre1">Time on Station and
Service Retainability. </b>Minimum time on station requirements exist to
provide continuity to an Airman’s member’s unit and, to the degree possible,
reasonable periods of stable family life for Airmen. Further, upon selection
for permanent change of station, an Airman must have or be able to obtain
certain minimum periods of obligated service depending on the type of permanent
change of station move. This committed service retainability ensures an Airman
has a period of Regular Air Force remaining long enough to offset the costs
associated with a permanent change of station. Minimum time on station provides
continuity to the gaining unit and stability to Airmen and their families
following permanent change of station. Some types of permanent change of
station require time on station periods or obligated service periods more or
less than the normal limits. Refer to AFI 36-2110 for the time on station and
retainability requirements for specific types of permanent change of station.<b class="calibre1">
</b></p>

<p class="msonormal15">15.4.9.1. <b class="calibre1">Continental United
States-to-Continental United States Permanent Change of Station.</b> For most
permanent change of station moves within the Continental United States,
first-term Airmen and career Airmen must have at least 48 months of time on
station, with the exception of first-term Airmen applying eligible for the
firstterm Airmen base of preference program. Special circumstances, such as
completion of a training course in permanent change of station status, have
different time on station minimums. The service retainability requirement for a
Continental United States-to-Continental United States permanent change of
station is 24 months regardless of career status. </p>

<p class="msonormal25">15.4.9.2.<b class="calibre1"> Continental United States-to-Overseas Permanent
Change of Station.</b> First-term Airmen must have at </p>

<p class="msonormal23">least 12 months of time on station to go from Continental
United States to overseas. Career Airmen require                 </p>

<p class="msonormal20">24 months of time on station before an overseas
permanent change of station. When notified of permanent change of station
selection, Airmen must have or be eligible to obtain sufficient service
retainability to complete the full prescribed overseas tour length elected
Airmen who do not have retainability may decline to obtain retainability or, if
eligible, may retire instead of accepting a permanent change of station.
Declining to obtain retainability for permanent change of station will affect a
career Airman by making him or her ineligible for promotion and reenlistment.
First-term Airmen become ineligible for most voluntary assignments. Airmen who
are eligible and desire that their dependents accompany them at government
expense during their overseas tours must serve the “accompanied by dependents”
overseas tour length. This tour is normally longer than the unaccompanied tour.
Electing to serve the longer accompanied tour requires the Airman to obtain the
obligated service retainability for the longer tour. Airmen who are either
ineligible or decline to obtain the service retainability for the accompanied
tour length will not receive approval for dependent travel at the government’s
expense or command sponsorship.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">15.4.9.3. <b class="calibre1">Overseas-to-Overseas Permanent Change
of Station.</b> If an Airman is serving overseas and is a volunteer for a
permanent change of station consecutive overseas tour or in-place consecutive
overseas tour, the Airman must complete the full-prescribed tour at the current
location and the full-prescribed overseas tour at the new location or another
full tour in place.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal26">15.4.9.4.<b class="calibre1">
Overseas-to-Continental United States Reassignment.</b> Reassignment from
overseas to continental United States requires the Airman, in most cases, to
have or obtain at least 12 months of obligated service retainability. The
exceptions are those Airmen serving at a dependent restricted short tour
location of 12 months Airmen who do not have retainability will be retained in
the overseas area involuntarily until their date of separation.<b class="calibre1"> </b>15.4.10.<b class="calibre1">
Enlisted Quarterly Assignments Listing (EQUAL) and EQUAL-Plus.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal27">EQUAL provides Airmen a listing of the assignment
requirements available for upcoming assignment cycles and allows them the
opportunity to align personal preferences to actual Air Force needs. The
listing identifies what assignments, by Air Force specialty code and grade, are
available at particular locations. The EQUAL-Plus supplements the EQUAL and is
used to advertise requirements for special duty assignments, joint and
departmental assignments, short-notice oversea assignments, and all Chief
Master Sergeant assignments. EQUAL-Plus shows upcoming requirements, any
special qualifications an Airman needs to be eligible for selection, the
available locations, reporting instructions, and points of contact for
additional information. Both lists can be viewed on the Air Force Personnel

<p class="msonormal10">15.4.11.<b class="calibre1"> Assignment Preferences (Enlisted Only). </b></p>

<p class="msonormal27">Chief Master Sergeants and Chief Master
Sergeant-selects volunteer for assignments on EQUAL-Plus by notifying their
assignment noncommissioned officer at Headquarters Air Force Senior Leadership
Management Office. Notification can be made via telephone, e-mail, datafax, or
electronic message. Senior Master Sergeants and below will use the view/change
assignment preference update feature in the virtual military personnel flight
to record continental United States or overseas assignment preferences. To
enhance the chance for selection to a desired location, Airmen should consult
the EQUAL and EQUAL-Plus listings. Upon completion of the update, a notice is
produced and available for print. (<b class="calibre1">Note: </b>Each Airman is individually
responsible for the currency and accuracy of assignment preferences.) When a
change in status occurs such as marriage, the Airman should update preferences
accordingly. Outdated preferences or no preferences on file will not be the
basis for release of an Airman from an assignment for which selected.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">15.4.11.1. <b class="calibre1">Home-Basing and Follow-On Assignment
Programs.</b> The purpose of these programs is to reduce permanent change of
station costs, reduce permanent change of station turbulence, and increase
stability for Airmen and their families by providing advance assignment
consideration. The servicing military personnel section must brief all eligible
Airmen selected for or electing to serve an unaccompanied overseas tour of 15
months or less on these programs. Airmen must either apply or decline to apply
for these programs in writing. AFI 36-2110, Attachment 5, contains more
information on these programs. </p>

<p class="msonormal21">15.4.11.2. <b class="calibre1">Assignment of Family Members.</b>
Assignment of family members to the same duty location or unit is not
prohibited, however, family members will not be assigned where one family
member will or may hold a command or supervisory position over another family
member. Such assignments result in, or may create a perception of, preferential
treatment or loss of impartiality, thereby compromising the integrity of
command and supervisory functions. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.4.12.<b class="calibre1"> Permanent Change of Station Cancellation by the
Air Force: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">15.4.12.1. Once an Airman is selected for permanent
change of station and orders are published, cancellation of the assignment
could impose a hardship on the Airman. Normally, a permanent change of station
is not cancelled within 60 days of the projected departure date unless the Airman
cannot be effectively used at the projected location. The assignment office of
primary responsibility may authorize the cancellation. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">15.4.12.2. If the Airman indicates a hardship will
exist as a result of the cancellation, then the military personnel section will
direct the Airman to prepare a written statement containing the details of the
hardship. The statement should be coordinated through the unit commander to the
military personnel section. Upon receipt, the military personnel section
advises the assignment office of primary responsibility, who considers
reinstatement of the original assignment, to provide an alternate assignment or
confirms cancellation and provides the reasons why the Airman is required to
remain at the present base. </p>

<p class="msonormal28">15.4.12.3. AFI 36-2110 contains additional information and
also contains guidance in the case where an Airman has departed from his or her
previous duty station and is en route to the new location.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

Care Plans </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.5. Policy.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal29">Department of Defense policy is that the member is
responsible for the care of family members during deployments and temporary
duty, as at all other times. Failure to produce a family care plan within 60
days of the discussion with the commander, supervisor, or commander’s designated
representative may result in disciplinary action and/or administrative
separation. In addition to a required family care plan, military members are
strongly encouraged to have a will. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.6. Members Who Must Have a Family Care Plan.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal30">Single-member parents with custody of children and
bear sole or joint responsibility, and military couples with dependents must
have a family care plan. Members who are solely responsible for the care of a
spouse, elderly family member, or adult family member with disabilities who is
dependent on the member for financial, medical, or logistical support (housing,
food, clothing, transportation, etc.) must also have a family care plan. This
includes family members who have limited command of the English language, are
unable to drive, or gain access to basic life-sustaining facilities. Members
whose family circumstances or personal status change must notify their
commander as soon as possible but no later than 30 days after any change in
circumstance or personal status requires them to establish a family care plan. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.7. Family Care Plans.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal31">These plans must include provisions for short-term
absences (such as temporary duty for schooling or training) and longterm
absences (such as operational deployments) and designate a caregiver for the
affected family members. Financial arrangements may include powers of attorney,
allotments, and other documents necessary for logistical movement of the family
or caregiver should any of these arrangements become necessary. Additional
items may be required to fit individual situations. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.7.1.<b class="calibre1"> Required Counseling: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal32">15.7.1.1. <b class="calibre1">New Duty Station.</b> Commanders or
first sergeants counsel all Airmen with family members on AFI 362908 during
inprocessing. During this counseling, commanders and first sergeants must
stress the importance of, and confirm the need for, family care certification
by completing Air Force IMT 357, <i class="calibre2">Family Care Certification</i>. Commanders
or first sergeants may not delegate counseling requirements. <b class="calibre1">Note: </b>For
members who are geographically separated from the commander’s location,
commanders may delegate, in writing, the authority to counsel members and
certify the Air Force IMT 357 to detachment or operating location chiefs. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">15.7.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Annual Briefing.</b> The commander or first
sergeant is required to annually brief, individually, all military members who
require an Air Force IMT 357 about their family care responsibilities. During
this briefing, the commander or first sergeant signs the Air Force IMT 357 each
time the plan is reviewed and certified, determining the actual workability of
the family care plan. The member signs and dates the Air Force IMT 357 to
document the briefing was completed. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.7.2. <b class="calibre1">Remedial Action.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.11. Selective Reenlistment Program. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal8">The selective reenlistment program applies to all enlisted
personnel and the objective is to ensure the Air Force retains only Airmen who
consistently demonstrate the capability and willingness to maintain high
professional standards. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.11.1.<b class="calibre1"> Selective Reenlistment by Category.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal15">In the Air Force, reenlistment is a privilege, not
a right. The selective reenlistment program provides a process by which
commanders/civilian directors and supervisors evaluate all first term, second
term, and career Airmen. Firstterm Airmen receive selective reenlistment
program consideration when they are within 15 months of their expiration of
term of service. Second term and career Airmen with less than 19 years of total
active federal military service are considered within 13 months of the original
expiration of term of service. Career Airmen also receive selective
reenlistment program consideration when within 13 months of completing 20 years
of total active federal military service. Once career Airmen have served beyond
20 years of total active federal military service, they receive selective
reenlistment program consideration each time they are within 13 months of their
original expiration of term of service. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.11.2.<b class="calibre1"> Responsibilities: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">15.11.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Unit Commander/Civilian Director.</b>
The unit commander/civilian director has total selective reenlistment program
selection and nonselection authority for all Airmen and may non-select any
Airman for reenlistment at any time outside of their selective reenlistment
program window. Reenlistment intent or retirement eligibility has no bearing on
the selective reenlistment program consideration process. Unit
commanders/civilian directors approve or deny reenlistment and ensure selection
or nonselection decisions are consistent with other qualitative decisions (such
as promotion) and are based on substantial evidence. Commanders/directors
consider enlisted performance report ratings, unfavorable information from any
substantiated source, the Airman’s willingness to comply with Air Force
standards, and the Airman’s ability (or lack thereof) to meet required training
and duty performance levels when determining if a member may reenlist.
Commanders/directors may reverse their decisions at any time.
Commanders/directors do not use the selective reenlistment program when
involuntary separation is more appropriate. </p>

<p class="msonormal39">15.11.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> Immediate Supervisor. </b>Supervisors
provide unit commanders/directors with recommendations concerning the Airman’s
career potential. The supervisor’s rater may perform the duties required by the
immediate supervisor if the immediate supervisor is on leave or temporary duty.
To ensure Airmen meet quality standards, immediate supervisors review the
report on individual personnel and the Air Force Form 1137, <i class="calibre2">Unfavorable
Information File Summary </i>(if applicable). They then evaluate duty
performance and leadership abilities. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.11.3.<b class="calibre1"> Procedures: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">15.11.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Selection.</b> The military personnel
section sends each unit a selective reenlistment program consideration roster
that identifies assigned Airmen who require selective reenlistment program
consideration. The military personnel section also sends a report on individual
personnel for each Airman being considered. The unit forwards the report on
individual personnel to supervisors so that each supervisor’s reenlistment
recommendation can be documented. The supervisor should carefully evaluate the
Airman’s duty performance and review the Airman’s personnel records before
making a recommendation to the commander. A supervisor who decides to recommend
the Airman for reenlistment places an “X” in the appropriate block, signs the
report on individual personnel, and returns the report to the unit commander.
The commander reviews the recommendation and evaluates the Airman’s duty
performance, future potential, and other pertinent information. The commander
selects the Airman for reenlistment by annotating and signing the selective
reenlistment program roster. The commander’s signature on the roster
constitutes formal selection. The commander sends the selective reenlistment
program roster to the military personnel section for processing. </p>

<p class="msonormal27">15.11.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> Nonselection.</b> If the supervisor
decides not to recommend an Airman for reenlistment, he or she initiates an Air
Force Form 418, <i class="calibre2">Selective Reenlistment Program Consideration for Airmen in
the Regular Air Force/Air Force Reserve</i>, and completes Section I and
Section II and forwards to the commander. The commander reviews the
recommendation and other pertinent data and decides whether to select the
Airman. If the commander does not select the Airman for reenlistment, the
commander completes Section III of the Air Force Form 418 and informs the
Airman of the decision. During the interview, the commander must make sure the
Airman understands the right to appeal the decision. The Airman must make known
his or her intention within three workdays of the date the Airman acknowledges
the nonselection decision. The Airman must submit the appeal to the military
personnel section within 10 calendar days of the date he or she renders the
appeal intent on the Air Force Form 418, Section V. The commander sends the Air
Force Form 418 to the military personnel section after the Airman signs and
initials the appropriate blocks. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.11.4.<b class="calibre1"> Appeals.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal18">Airmen have the right to appeal selective
reenlistment program nonselection decisions. The specific appeal authority is
based on an Airman’s total active federal military service. First-term Airmen
and career Airmen who will complete at least 20 years of total active federal
military service on their current expiration of term of service appeal
selective reenlistment program nonselection to their respective group
commanders. The Airman’s respective wing commander is the selective
reenlistment program appeal authority for second term and career Airmen who
will complete fewer than 16 years of total active federal military service on
their current expiration of term of service. The Secretary of the Air Force is
the selective reenlistment program appeal authority for second term and career
Airmen who will complete at least 16 years of total active federal military
service but fewer than 20 years of total active federal military service on
their current expiration of term of service. The decision of the appeal
authority is final. The appeal authority’s decision is documented on the Air
Force Form 418, and the Airman is advised of the outcome. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.12. Enlistment Extensions.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal40">Any Airman serving on a Regular Air Force
enlistment may request an extension if he or she has a service-directed
retainability reason and in the best interest of the Air Force. Extensions are
granted in whole-month increments. For example, if the individual needs 15 ½
months of retainability for an assignment, the individual must request a
16-month extension. Voluntary extensions for all Airmen are limited to a
maximum of 48 months per enlistment. In the event Air Force specialty codes are
constrained, Air Staff may limit first-term Airmen extensions to a specified
period. Certain situations (such as citizenship pending) may warrant exceptions
to policy. Once approved, an extension has the legal effect of the enlistment
agreement by extending the period of obligated service. Extensions can only be
canceled if the reason for the extension no longer exists, given the Airman has
not entered into the extension. For example, if a member was approved for an
extension due to an assignment and that assignment was canceled, the member
could then cancel the extension within 30 calendar days provided they have not
entered into the extension period. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.13.</b> <b class="calibre1">High Year of Tenure. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal40">High year of tenure provides the Air Force with
another method of stabilizing the career structure of the enlisted force. High
year of tenure essentially represents the maximum number of years Airmen may
serve in their current grade AFI 363208, <i class="calibre2">Administrative Separation of Airmen</i>,
contains waiver provisions for Airmen who believe they have sufficient
justification to warrant retention beyond their high year of tenure, but the
majority of Airmen are not permitted to reenlist or extend their enlistments if
their new date of separation exceeds their high year of tenure. Airmen may be
eligible to request an extension of enlistment to establish a date of
separation at high year of tenure too separate or retire. Normally, Airmen must
be within 2 years of their high year of tenure before they can extend. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.14. Selective Retention Bonus.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal30">The selective retention bonus is a monetary
incentive paid to enlisted members to attract reenlistments in, and retraining
into, critical military skills with insufficient reenlistments to sustain the
career force in those skills. Headquarters United States Air Force adds and
deletes skills from the selective retention bonus list as requirements change.
The military personnel section is the best source of information on selective
retention bonus skills. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">15.14.1. <b class="calibre1">Zones.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal41">The selective reenlistment bonus is paid in four zones
based on total active federal military service: </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.14.1.1. Zone A applies to Airmen reenlisting between 17
months and 6 years. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.14.1.2. Zone B applies to Airmen reenlisting between 6
and 10 years. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.14.1.3. Zone C applies to Airmen reenlisting between 10
and 14 years. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.14.1.4. Zone E applies to Airmen reenlisting between 18
and 20 years. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.14.2. <b class="calibre1">Computing Selective Retention Bonus Awards.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal17">The Air Force calculates the selective retention
bonus on the basis of monthly base pay (the rate in effect on the date of
discharge [day before reenlistment date] or the day before an extension begins)
multiplied by the number of whole years incurred on reenlistment, multiplied by
the selective retention bonus multiple for the skill. The selective retention
bonus is only payable for obligated service not exceeding 24 years of active
service. The maximum selective retention bonus payable to eligible Airmen is
$90,000 per zone. Eligible Airmen may receive a selective retention bonus in
each zone but only one selective retention bonus per zone (for example, they
can receive the last zone A payment and the first zone B payment during the
same year). The Air Force, based on current policy directives, may pay up to
100 percent of the bonus amount (less tax) at the time of reenlistment or
extension and the remaining percent in equal installments on the anniversary of
the reenlistment or extension date. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.15.</b> <b class="calibre1">Career Job Reservation Program. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">Because of various career force size and
composition restrictions, there are times when the Air Force must place a limit
on the number of first-term Airmen who may reenlist. The Career Job Reservation
Program exists to assist in the management of first-term Airmen reenlistments,
by Air Force specialty code, in order to prevent surpluses and shortages. The
Career Job Reservation Program can be active or suspended based on Air Force
requirements. When active and in use the program details are as follows: </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.15.1.<b class="calibre1"> When to Apply for a Career Job Reservation. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal20">Headquarters United States Air Force meets
management requirements by establishing and maintaining a career job
requirements file for each Air Force specialty code. Air Force specialty codes
career job requirements are distributed over a 12-month period. All eligible
first-term Airmen must have an approved Career Job Reservation in order to
reenlist. Airmen are automatically placed on the Career Job Reservation waiting
list on the 1st duty day of the month during which they complete 35 months on
their current enlistment (59 months for 6-year enlistees), but no later than
the last duty day of the month during which they complete 43 months on their
current enlistment (67 months for 6year enlistees To keep their approved Career
Job Reservation, Airmen must reenlist on or before the Career Job Reservation
expiration date. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.15.2. <b class="calibre1">Career Job Reservation Waiting List.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal20">When the number of Career Job Reservation
applicants exceeds the number of available quotas, Air Force Personnel Center
must use a rank-order process to determine which Airmen will receive an
approved Career Job Reservation. Airmen compete for a Career Job Reservation in
their respective initial term of enlistment group (4-year or 6-year enlistee).
Applicants are ranked using the following factors: unfavorable information file
(automatic disqualifier), top three enlisted performance reports, current grade,
projected grade, date of rank, total active federal military service date.
Applicants are placed on the Air Force-wide career job applicant waiting list
when there are no Career Job Reservations available. An Airman’s position on
the waiting list is subject to change as his or her rank order information
changes or as new Airmen apply. Airmen may remain on the Career Job Reservation
waiting list until their 43rd month on their current enlistment (67 months for
6-year enlistees Supervisors should encourage Airmen to pursue retraining into
a shortage skill if a Career Job Reservation is not immediately available. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.15.3. <b class="calibre1">Career Job Reservation in an Additionally Awarded
Air Force Specialty Code.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal20">When Airmen are placed on the Career Job
Reservation waiting list in their Air Force specialty code, they may request a
Career Job Reservation in an additionally awarded Air Force specialty code if
quotas are readily available, the Air Force specialty code is different from
their control Air Force specialty code, and they possess at least a 3skill
level in the Air Force specialty code.  </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.16.</b> <b class="calibre1">Air Force Retraining Program.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal40">Retraining is a force management program used
primarily to balance the enlisted career force across all Air Force specialty
codes and ensure sustainability of career fields. Retraining also provides a
means to return disqualified Airmen to a productive status. Additionally, the
program allows a limited number of Airmen the opportunity to pursue other
career paths within the Air Force. The Air Force encourages Airmen to
voluntarily retrain first, however, the needs of the Air Force may require
Airmen to be involuntarily retrained to meet sustainment objectives.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.16.1.<b class="calibre1"> First-Term Airmen Retraining Program.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal20">The first-term Airmen Retraining Program is
designed to retrain first-term Airmen in conjunction with a reenlistment, into
skills where shortages exist and additionally, allows a limited number of
Airmen the opportunity to pursue other career paths in the Air Force. Airmen
maybe selected for involuntary retraining based on Air Force needs to balance
the force. Airmen may apply not earlier than the 1st duty day of the month
during which they complete 35 months of their current enlistment (59 months for
6-year enlistees), but not later than the last duty day of the 43rd month of
their current enlistment (67 months for 6-year enlistees). On the last duty day
of each month, Air Force Personnel Center runs a retraining board to select the
most eligible Airmen. This is not a physical board, but a computer based one.
Applications are prioritized on quality indicators; e.g., most recent enlisted
performance report (EPR) rating; current grade; projected grade; next two EPR
ratings; Date of Rank; Total Active Federal Military Service Date; Aptitude
Qualification Examination score in the applicable area (electrical, mechanical,
administrative, general or combination in accordance with Air Force Enlisted
Classification Directory, Part II, Attachment 4 (Additional Qualifications));
requested Air Force Specialty Code preferences. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.16.2. <b class="calibre1">NCO Retraining Program.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal11">The NCO retraining program is designed to retrain second
term and career Airmen from overage Air Force specialties into shortage
specialties to optimize the enlisted force to best meet current and future mission
needs. Airmen possessing a secondary, or additional Air Force Specialty Code in
a shortage skill, may be returned to the shortage skill if in the best interest
of the Air Force. This program consists of two phases: Phase I (voluntary) and
Phase II (involuntary). Retraining objectives are determined by Air Staff. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.17.8. <b class="calibre1">Health Care:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal18">15.17.8.1. The transition from receiving care
within the Military Healthcare System into the Veterans Health Administration
can be challenging and at times confusing. Therefore, for caregivers to
understand some of the basic differences between the two is helpful. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">15.17.8.2. Military health care, known as TRICARE,
is operated through the Department of Defense and provides medical care for
Regular Air Force and retired members of the military and their dependents. The
Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Health Administration provides health
care for enrolled veterans and their eligible family members through a network
of hospitals and clinics across the country. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.17.8.3. The two departments work together, but have
different eligibility criteria, health benefits and costs. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.17.8.4. Also, important is understanding the Veterans
Administration consists of three separate organizations: Veterans Affairs
Healthcare, Veterans Affairs Benefits, and Veterans Affairs National
Cemeteries. </p>

<p class="msonormal46">15.17.8.5. Enrollment in the Veterans Affairs
healthcare system meets the requirement for having health care coverage under
the new health care law, Affordable Care Act that went into effect on 1 October
2013. Additional information on the Affordable Care Act and Veterans Affairs
can be found on the Veterans Affairs website: <a href="http://www.va.gov/aca" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">www.va.gov/aca</span></a><a href="http://www.va.gov/aca" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">.</span></a><b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.18. Retirement Benefits. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal29">Enlisted members are eligible to retire if they
have 20 years of total active federal military service and there are no
restrictions per AFI 36-3203. Enlisted members must apply for retirement.
Otherwise, they will separate on their date of separation or expiration of term
of service. Officers must have 20 years of total active federal military
service and 10 years of total active federal commissioned service to be
eligible to retire. A retirement application may be submitted through virtual
military personnel flight up to 12 months, but no less than 120 days, before
the desired retirement date. Every individual who hopes to retire one day
should be familiar with this information. The retirement application is not
allinclusive, and there are exceptions. Every military member should seek
personal counseling from the Total Force Contact Center before making firm
plans. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.18.1.<b class="calibre1"> Place of Retirement.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal17">In general, a member may retire in the continental
United States. Members assigned to a duty station in the continental United
States retire at the duty station. If the member is overseas, the member and
family can proceed to the final continental United States home of selection. If
the member elects to retire overseas and live permanently in that country, he
or she must comply with command and host government residency rules before the
date of retirement. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.18.2. <b class="calibre1">Retired Pay.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal11">The date initially entered military service normally
determines which of the existing retirement pay plans applies to a member. Date
initially entered military service<b class="calibre1"> </b>is the date an individual was
initially enlisted, inducted, or appointed in a regular or reserve component of
a uniformed service as a commissioned officer, warrant officer, or enlisted
member. The date initially entered military service is a fixed date that is not
subject to adjustment because of a break in service. Current active military
personnel will fall under one of the retirement plans described in Table 15.1. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.19.</b> <b class="calibre1">Survivor Benefit Plan:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal29">15.19.1. Military pay stops when a member dies.
Established by Congress on 21 September 1972, the survivor benefit plan
provides a monthly income to survivors of retired military personnel upon the
member’s death. The survivor benefit plan is a government program for retiring
members to ensure their eligible survivors receive a portion of their military
retired pay in the form of a monthly annuity after their death. The plan was
structured so a surviving spouse cannot outlive the annuity, and cost-of-living
adjustments are incorporated to offset inflation. Regular Air Force members
with a spouse or dependent children are automatically covered by the survivor
benefit plan at no cost while they remain on Regular Air Force. The member’s
death must be classified in line of duty in order for an annuity to be payable
if the member is not yet retirement eligible (has not accrued 20 years of
Regular Air Force) on the date of death. The annuity payable is 55 percent of
the retired pay the member would have been entitled to receive if retired with
a total disability rating on the date of death. An annuity may also be payable
if the member’s death is classified not in line of duty, as long as the member
was retirement eligible on the date of death. In this case, annuity payable is
55 percent of the retired pay the member would have been entitled to receive if
retired for years of service on the date of death. The surviving spouse of a
member who dies in the line of duty while on Regular Air Force may request the
survivor benefit plan be paid only to the member’s children, avoiding the
reduction caused by a spouse’s receipt of dependency and indemnity
compensation, the survivor benefits paid by the Department of Veteran Affairs
when a member’s death is determined to have resulted from a serviceconnected
cause. </p>

<p class="msonormal69">15.19.2. The survivor benefit plan is the only program
that enables a portion of military retired pay to be paid to a member’s
survivors. Prior to retiring, each member must decide whether to continue
survivor benefit plan coverage into retirement. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">If electing coverage, survivor benefit plan
premiums are assessed and automatically deducted from the member’s monthly
retired pay. Premiums are government-subsidized and deducted from a
participating member’s retired pay before taxes.   15.19.3. Survivor benefit
plan premiums and beneficiary annuity payments depend on what is called the
“base amount” elected as the basis of coverage. A service member’s base amount
can be the full monthly retired pay or a portion of retired pay, down to $300.
Full coverage means full-retired pay is elected as the base amount. The base
amount is tied to a member’s retired pay; therefore, when retired pay receives
cost-of-living adjustments, so does the base amount, and as a result, so do
premiums and the annuity payments. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">15.19.4. Generally the survivor benefit plan is an
irrevocable decision. However, under limited circumstances, you may withdraw
from the survivor benefit plan (Figure 15.1) or change your coverage. As a
survivor benefit plan participant, you have a 1-year window to terminate
survivor benefit plan coverage between the second and third anniversary
following the date you begin to receive retired pay. The premiums you paid will
not be refunded, and an annuity will not be payable upon your death. Your
covered spouse or former spouse must consent to the withdrawal. Termination is
permanent, and participation may not be resumed under any circumstance barring
future enrollment. The survivor benefit plan also has a “paid-up” feature that
permits members who have attained age 70 and who have paid survivor benefit
plan premiums for 360 months to stop paying premiums but remain active
participants in the plan. Additional information can be attained through the
local military personnel section office or the Airman and Family Readiness
Center. </p>

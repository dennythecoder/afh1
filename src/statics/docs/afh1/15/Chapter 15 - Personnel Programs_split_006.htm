<p class="msonormal80">The
American Red Cross offers confidential services to all military personnel
Regular, National Guard and Reserve, and their families. Counseling, guidance,
information, referrals and other social services are available through our
worldwide network of chapters and offices on military installations. American
Red Cross chapters are listed in local telephone books and at your local
American Red Cross. As more and more National Guard and Reserve units are
called to full-time duty status, counseling has become increasingly important
to prepare the civilian-based military members and their families for the
period of activation. Because members of the National Guard and Reserve
typically live in civilian neighborhoods, they and their families frequently
have difficulty accessing much-needed, military-related social services. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.22. Personal Information File: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal81">15.22.1. Commanders and supervisors perform many
personnel management functions requiring them to keep files on assigned
personnel. AFI 36-2608, <i class="calibre2">Military Personnel Records System,</i> authorizes
the use and maintenance of the commander’s or supervisor’s personal information
files. Unit commanders or equivalents maintain discretion to create personal
information files on all assigned personnel, but personal information files are
mandatory for officer personnel who receive a letter of admonishment or a
letter of counseling. If a personal information file is established, use of Air
Force Form 10A, <i class="calibre2">Personnel Information File, Record of Performance, Officer
Command Selection Record Group</i>, is required. Contents are governed by AFI
36-2608. Custodians must keep the personal information files current and
secured in a locked area or container to protect against misuse or unauthorized
access. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">15.22.2. According to the Privacy Act of 1974, a
person who is the subject of the record may request access to this record at
any time. Individuals have the right to review their personal information file
at any time and challenge or question the need for documents in the file. The
contents are available to commanders, raters, first sergeants, senior raters,
Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and staff judge advocate personnel
as warranted. The release and review of the personal information file contents
in these instances are for “official business” or “routine use” according to
AFI 33-332, <i class="calibre2">Air Force</i> <i class="calibre2">Privacy and Civil Liberties</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal31">15.23.1. The Privacy Act of 1974 as amended <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opcl/1974privacyact-overview.htm" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre10">(</span></a><a href="http://www.justice.gov/opcl/1974privacyact-overview.htm" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">http://www.justice.gov/opcl/1974privacyact</span></a><a href="http://www.justice.gov/opcl/1974privacyact-overview.htm" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">-</span></a><a href="http://www.justice.gov/opcl/1974privacyact-overview.htm" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">overview.htm</span></a><a href="http://www.justice.gov/opcl/1974privacyact-overview.htm" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre10">)</span></a> establishes a code of fair information
practices that govern the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of
personal information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records
by federal agencies. Privacy Act System of Records is defined in the Act as “a
group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is
retrieved by the individual’s name, number, or unique identifier”. Individual
is defined in the Act as “a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence.” Privacy Act rights are personal to the
individual who is the subject of the record and cannot be asserted derivatively
by others. Note, however, the parent of any minor, or the legal guardian of an
incompetent, may act on behalf of that individual. The Privacy Act prohibits
the disclosure of information from a system of records absent the written
consent of the subject individual. </p>

<p class="msonormal31">15.23.2. The Privacy Act limits the collection of
information to what the law or Executive Orders authorize. System of Records
Notices must be published in the Federal Register allowing the public a 30-day
comment period. Such collection must not conflict with the rights guaranteed by
the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. A Privacy Act statement
must be given when individuals are asked to provide personal information about
themselves for collection in a system of records. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">15.23.3. In addition to specifying disclosure
procedures, the Privacy Act governs the maintenance of systems of records. The
Act provides individuals with a means by which to seek access to and amend their
records and sets forth agency record-keeping requirements. Individuals have the
right to request access or amendment to their records in a system. Personally
identifiable information in a system of records must be safeguarded to ensure
“an official need to know” access of the records and to avoid actions that
could result in harm, embarrassment, or unfairness to the individual. The law
limits the uses of records to the purposes that are stated in the System of
Records Notices, as published in the Federal Register. System of Records
Notices for Air Force records systems can be found at <a href="http://dpcld.defense.gov/Privacy/SORNs.aspx" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">http://dpcld.defense.gov/Privacy/SORNs.aspx</span></a><a href="http://dpcld.defense.gov/Privacy/SORNs.aspx" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre5">.</span></a> Department of Defense personnel may disclose
records to other offices in the Department of Defense when there is “an
official need to know” and to other federal government agencies or individuals
when a discloser of record is a “routine use” published in the System of
Records Notices or as authorized by a Privacy Act exception. In addition,
information may be released for a disclosed specified purpose with the
subject’s consent. The Office of Primary Responsibility of the data should keep
an account of all information they’ve released. </p>

<p class="msonormal31">15.23.4. For further information, definitions,
exemptions, exceptions, or responsibilities and procedures for safeguarding and
reporting of personally identifiable information breaches, consult AFI 33-332, <i class="calibre2">Air
Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program</i>. The Office of Management and
Budget defines a personally identifiable information breach as, “A loss of
control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition,
unauthorized access, or any similar term referring to situations where persons
other than authorized users and for an other than authorized purpose have
access or potential access to personally identifiable information, whether
physical or electronic.” </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.24. Freedom of Information Act. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal31">The Freedom of Information Act provides access to
federal agency records (or parts of these records) except those protected from
release by nine specific exemptions. Freedom of Information Act requests are
written requests that cite or imply the Freedom of Information Act. The law
establishes rigid time limits for replying to requesters and permits assessing
fees in certain instances. The Freedom of Information Act imposes mandatory
time limits of 20 workdays to either deny the request or release the requested
records. The law permits an additional 10-workday extension in unusual
circumstances specifically outlined in the Freedom of Information Act. (<b class="calibre1">Note:</b>
Denials require notification of appeal rights. Requester can file an appeal or
litigate.) Refer to Air Force Manual 33-302,<i class="calibre2"> Freedom of Information Act
Program</i>, for specific policy and procedures on the Freedom of Information
Act and for guidance on disclosing records to the public. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.25. Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records:
</b></p>

<p class="msonormal40">15.25.1. The Air Force Board for Correction of
Military Records is the highest level of administrative review and powerful,
yet simple system for correcting military records. Unless procured by fraud,
their decision is final and binding on all Air Force officials and government
agencies. The Air Force Board for Correction of Military Record’s authority,
jurisdiction, and policy are explained in AFI 36-2603, <i class="calibre2">Air Force Board for
Correction of Military Records</i>. Air Force Pamphlet 362607, <i class="calibre2">Applicants’
Guide to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records</i>, contains
additional information.<i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal40">15.25.2. With few exceptions, most records
generated by the Air Force may be corrected by the Air Force Board for
Correction of Military Records; however, an applicant must exhaust other
reasonably available administrative avenues of relief prior to applying to the
Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records. For instance, Enlisted
Performance Reports may be voided, upgraded, or rewritten; discharges and
reenlistment/reentry eligibility codes may be upgraded; survivor benefit plan
elections may be changed; leave may be credited; Article 15 actions may be
voided; reinstatement into the Air Force may be achieved, etc. Records may be
changed, voided, or created as necessary to correct an error or to remove an
injustice, and applicable monetary benefits are recomputed based on the records
changed. The Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records cannot,
however, change the verdict of a courts-martial imposed after 5 May 1950 but
may, on the basis of clemency, change the punishment imposed by the final
reviewing authority. </p>

<p class="msonormal83">15.25.3. Because the Air Force
Board for Correction of Military Records is the highest level of administrative
appeal in the Air Force, Applicants must first exhaust other administrative
remedies before applying to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military
Records. Otherwise their application (DD Form 149, <i class="calibre2">Application for
Correction of Military Record </i></p>

<p class="msonormal84"><i class="calibre2">Under the Provisions
of Title 10, United States Code, Section 1552</i>) will be returned without
action. For example, Enlisted </p>

<p class="msonormal29">Performance Report appeals must first be submitted
through Evaluation Reports Appeal Board, under the provisions of AFI 36-2401, <i class="calibre2">Correcting
Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Reports</i>. Applicants should consult AFPAM
36-2607 and or consult with their Force Support Squadron to determine which
administrative avenues of relief are available to them depending on the nature
of the correction sought. </p>

<p class="msonormal29">15.25.4. Application to the Air Force Board for
Correction of Military Records is a simple process. However, favorable
consideration of the application depends on all the facts and circumstances of
the case and how well the request is supported by documentary evidence. The Air
Force Board for Correction of Military Records is not an investigative body and
except in those rare cases where a personal appearance is granted and testimony
is taken, and the decision is based on the evidence contained in the case file.
This normally consists of the applicant’s submission (e.g. statements,
arguments, documentary evidence, etc.), military record, and advisory
opinion(s) from the Air Force office of primary responsibility. There is a
presumption of regularity on the part of the government and absent evidence to
the contrary is assumed that all government officials exercised their duties in
accordance with law and policy. Because of this, the applicant bears the burden
of providing sufficient evidence to establish the existence of an error or an
injustice in record. The type and extent of evidence necessary to support the
case depends on the nature of the request. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">15.25.5. Cases are reviewed in executive session by
a panel of three members, randomly selected from the Air Force Board for
Correction of Military Records membership. These members, General Schedule-15s
and above, the majority of whom are members of the Senior Executive Service
cadre, are appointed from the executive part of the department and serve at the
discretion of the Secretary. However, service on the board is a collateral,
volunteer duty. Applicants may request a personal appearance before the Air
Force Board for Correction of Military Records; however, a personal appearance
is not a statutory right and is granted solely at the discretion of the Board,
predicated on the finding the applicant’s presence, without or without counsel,
will materially add to the Board’s understanding of the issue(s) involved. Few
personal appearances are granted and the decision to conduct such a hearing is
made at the time the Board initially adjudicates the application. During
deliberations, which are conducted in Executive Session, Board members decide
whether the applicant has first exhausted all available avenues of
administrative relief; whether the application has been timely filed and if
not, whether the failure to do so should be waived in the interest of justice;
whether the provisions of Title 10, United States Code, Section 1034 apply to
the case, and whether an error or an injustice exists. The Board is a
recommending body on all cases and will vote to grant, partially grant, and
deny the requested relief. If the board recommends favorable relief, the case
is forwarded to the Secretary of the Air Force’s designee for final decision.
Applicants have the right to request reconsideration of the Board’s decision;
however, reconsideration is granted only if the applicant can provide newly
discovered relevant evidence that was not reasonably available when the
original application was submitted. </p>

<p class="msonormal85">15.25.6. Applications formally
considered by the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records are
processed within 10 to 18 months. Title 10, United States Code, Section 1557, <i class="calibre2">Timeliness
Standards for Disposition of Applications Before Corrections Boards,</i>
provides oversight and clearance deadlines for the correction of military
records review and decision. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">After fiscal year 2010, 90 percent of the cases must be
completed within 10 months. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.26. Air Force Discharge Review Board:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal29">15.26.1. The Air Force Discharge Review Board
affords former Air Force members the opportunity to request review of their
discharge (except for a discharge or dismissal by general court-martial). The
objective of a discharge review is to examine an applicant’s administrative
discharge and to change the characterization of service, the reason for
discharge, and the re-enlistment code (when applicable), based on standards of
propriety or equity. Bad conduct discharges, given as a result of a special
court-martial, may be upgraded on clemency factors. </p>

<p class="msonormal37">15.26.2. A personal appearance before the Air Force
Discharge Review Board is a statutory right. The applicant or the applicant’s
counsel may appear before the board in Washington District of Columbia (Joint
Base Andrews Naval Air Facility Washington, Maryland) or at a regional
location. The Board conducts regional boards via video teleconference.  The
application can also be considered on a record review basis prior to a request
for personal appearance, whereupon the board will review the case based on
documentation in the military record and any additional evidence provided by
the applicant. The Air Force Discharge Review Board procedures allow the
applicant latitude in presenting evidence, witnesses, and testimony in support
of the applicant’s case. </p>

<p class="msonormal4">15.26.3. Airmen separated under circumstances
(except retirement) that make them ineligible for reenlistment and officers
discharged under adverse conditions are briefed by the Military Personnel
Section at the time of their discharge about the Air Force Discharge Review
Board process. They are provided with a discharge review fact sheet and an
application (DD Form 293, <i class="calibre2">Application for the Review of Discharge from the
Armed Forces of the United States</i>). </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.26.3.1. No minimum waiting period is required to submit
an application. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.26.3.2. No provisions exist to automatically upgrade a
discharge. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.26.3.3. The military will not pay travel expenses to
Air Force Discharge Review Board hearing sites. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.26.3.4. The military will not bear the cost of private
counsel. </p>

<p class="msonormal86">15.26.3.4.1. Members may engage counsel at their
own expense; however, a number of organizations provide counsel at no cost or a
representative to assist applicants. These include national service
organizations such as the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, and
Veterans of Foreign Wars. </p>

<p class="msonormal87">15.26.3.5. There is a Department of Defense
Electronic Reading Room for the Military Departments Boards for the Corrections
of Military/Naval Records and the Discharge Review Boards. The Reading Room
contains the decisional documents for each of the Boards from October 1998. The
personally identifiable information has been removed (redacted) from these
documents. The Reading Room site is: <a href="http://boards.law.af.mil/" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">http://boards.law.af.mil/</span></a><a href="http://boards.law.af.mil/" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">.</span></a><span class="calibre43"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal18">15.26.3.6. Former Members with Post-traumatic
Stress Disorder or Traumatic Brain Injury. In the case of a former member of
the armed forces who, while serving on Regular Air Force as a member of the
armed forces, was deployed in support of a contingency operation and who, at
any time after such deployment, was diagnosed by a physician, clinical
psychologist, or psychiatrist as experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder or
traumatic brain injury as a consequence of that deployment, a board established
under this section to review the former member's discharge or dismissal shall
include a member who is a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist, or a physician
with training on mental health issues connected with post-traumatic stress
disorder or traumatic brain injury (as applicable). </p>

<p class="msonormal18">15.26.3.7. Former Members with Mental Health
Diagnoses. In the case of a former member of the armed forces who was diagnosed
while serving in the armed forces as experiencing a mental health disorder, a
board established under this section to review the former member’s discharge or
dismissal shall include a member who is a clinical psychologist or
psychiatrist, or a physician with special training on mental health disorders. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.27. The Virtual Military Personnel Flight. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal88">The Virtual Military Personnel Flight<b class="calibre1"> </b>is a
suite of applications that provides the ability to conduct some of the Airmen’s
personnel business on line. Examples of applications available now include
application for humanitarian reassignment, duty history inquiry, overseas

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.28. Introduction. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal81">Air Force members make many personal and
professional sacrifices to ensure the Air Force accomplishes its mission. Acts
of valor, heroism, exceptional service, and outstanding achievement deserve
special recognition. The Air Force Awards and Decorations Program, AFI 36-2803,
<i class="calibre2">The Air Force Awards and Decorations Program</i>, is limited to recognizing
units, organizations, or individuals. This program is designed to foster
morale, provide incentive, and esprit de corps. Individuals or units considered
for awards and decorations under this program must clearly demonstrate
sustained and superior performance. Questions about the Air Force Awards and
Decorations Program may be directed to the servicing military personnel
section.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.29.1. <b class="calibre1">Service and Campaign Awards. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal20">These awards recognize members for honorable active
military service for participation in a campaign, period of war, national
emergency, expedition, or a specified significant peacetime military operation.
They also recognize individuals who participate in specific or significant
military operations and who participate in specific types of service while
serving on Regular Air Force or as a member of the Reserve forces. Individuals
should keep copies of their temporary duty and permanent change of station orders
and travel vouchers to help prove entitlement to service and campaign awards.
Additional service and campaign awards can be found in AFI 36-2803, <i class="calibre2">The Air

<p class="msonormal89">15.29.1.1. <b class="calibre1">Global War on
Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.</b>
Two of the most common service awards worn by Air Force members today are the
Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Global War on Terrorism
Service Medal. They were established on 12 March 2003. </p>

<p class="msonormal27">The Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal is
awarded to members who deployed on or after 11 September 2001 for service in
Operations ENDURING FREEDOM, IRAQI FREEDOM, or NEW DAWN. The Global War on
Terrorism Service Medal is awarded to members who participated in the Global
War on Terrorism operations outside of the designated area of eligibility for
the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal and
Iraq Campaign Medal, on or after 11 September 2001 and a date to be determined.
</p>

<p class="msonormal20">15.29.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Afghanistan Campaign Medal and the
Iraq Campaign Medal.</b> Two other service medals being issued are the
Afghanistan Campaign Medal and Iraq Campaign Medal. The Afghanistan Campaign
Medal and Iraq Campaign Medal were established on 29 November 2004 and
recognize service members who serve or have served in the respective countries
in support of Operations ENDURING FREEDOM, IRAQI FREEDOM, or NEW DAWN.
Effective 1 May 2005, members deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq receive the
respective campaign medal in lieu of the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary
Medal. Campaign stars are worn on the ribbons to designate official campaign
periods as established by the Department of Defense.<span class="calibre69">
</span>An Arrowhead Device is authorized to denote participation in a combat
parachute jump, helicopter assault landing, combat glider landing, or
amphibious assault landing, while assigned or attached as a member of an
organized force carrying out an assigned tactical mission. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">15.29.1.3. <b class="calibre1">Korea Defense Service Medal. </b>In February
2004, Department of Defense approved the Korea Defense Service Medal for
Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard personnel as
recognition for military service in the Republic of Korea and the surrounding
waters after 28 July 1954 and a future date to be determined. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">15.29.1.4. <b class="calibre1">Humanitarian Service Medal.</b> The
Humanitarian Service Medal<b class="calibre1"> </b>is awarded to members of the United States
Armed Forces and their Reserve components who, after 1 April 1975, distinguished
themselves as individuals or members of United States military units or ships
by meritorious direct participation in a significant military act or operation
of humanitarian nature. “Direct participation” is any member assigned directly
to the humanitarian operation providing hands-on participation. A bronze
service star denotes subsequent awards. A listing of approved operations for
the Humanitarian Service Medal are identified in DoDM 1348.33, <i class="calibre2">Manual of
Military Decorations and Awards</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.29.2. <b class="calibre1">Unit Awards.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal90">These awards are presented to United States
military units that distinguish themselves during peacetime or in action
against hostile forces or an armed enemy of the United States. To preserve the
integrity of unit awards, they are approved only to recognize acts or services
that are clearly and distinctly outstanding by nature and magnitude<span class="calibre3">. </span>The acts or services
recognized must place the unit’s performance above that of other units similar
in composition and mission and be of such importance that they cannot be
appropriately recognized in any other way. Only one unit award is awarded for
the same achievement or service. The unit’s entire service must have been
honorable during the distinguished act. An organization may display the award
elements of a unit award. Designated subordinate units of the organization may
also share in the award; however, higher organizations may not. All assigned or
attached people who served with a unit during a period for which a unit award
was awarded are authorized the appropriate ribbon if they directly contributed
to the mission and accomplishments of the unit. Questions concerning
eligibility to wear a specific unit award may be directed to the local military
personnel section. The five most common unit awards worn by Air Force members
today are Gallant Unit Citation, the Meritorious Unit Award, the Air Force
Outstanding Unit Award, the Air Force Organizational Excellence Award, and the
Joint Meritorious Unit Award. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">15.29.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Gallant Unit Citation.</b> The
Gallant Unit Citation was approved by the Secretary of the Air Force in March
2004 and is awarded to Air Force units for extraordinary heroism in action
against an armed enemy of the United States while engaged in military
operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force on or after 11
September 2001. The unit must have performed with marked distinction under
difficult and hazardous conditions in accomplishing its mission so as to set it
apart from and above other units participating in the same conflict. The
Gallant Unit Citation will normally be earned by units that have participated
in single or successive actions covering relatively brief time spans. </p>

<p class="msonormal27">15.29.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Meritorious Unit Award.</b> The
Meritorious Unit Award was also approved by the Secretary of the Air Force in
March 2004 and is awarded to Air Force units for exceptionally meritorious
conduct in performance of outstanding achievement or service in direct support
of combat operations for at least 90 continuous days during the period of
military operations against an armed enemy of the United States on or after 11
September 2001. Superior performance of normal mission alone will not justify
award of the Meritorious Unit Award. Service in a combat zone is not required,
but service must be directly related to the combat effort. The Meritorious Unit
Award is not awarded to any unit or unit component previously awarded the Air
Force Outstanding Unit Award, Air Force Organizational Excellence Award, or
unit awards from other Service components for the same act, achievement, or
service. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">15.29.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Air Force Outstanding Unit Award.</b>
The Air Force Outstanding Unit Award was established and awarded in the name of
the Secretary of the Air Force 6 Jan 1954. The Air Force Outstanding Unit Award
is awarded only to numbered units or numbered Air Forces, air divisions, wings,
groups, and squadrons. To be awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, an
organization must have performed meritorious service or outstanding
achievements that clearly set the unit above and apart from similar units.
Commanders must annually review the accomplishments of their eligible
subordinate units and recommend only those units that are truly exceptional.
Only 10 percent of similar units assigned to a command are recommended
annually. Commanders send Air Force Outstanding Unit Award recommendations to
their major commands for consideration. Certain recommendations for the Air
Force Outstanding Unit Award are exempt from annual submission. These are
recommendations for specific achievements, combat operations, or conflict with
hostile forces. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">15.29.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Air Force Organizational Excellence
Award.</b> The Air Force Organizational Excellence Award was established and
awarded in the name of the Secretary of the Air Force 6 Jan 1954.<span class="calibre69"> </span>The Air Force Organizational Excellence Award has
the same guidelines and approval authority as the Air Force Outstanding Unit
Award. The Air Force Organizational Excellence Award is awarded to unnumbered
organizations such as a major command headquarters, a field operating agency, a
direct reporting unit, the Office of the Chief of Staff, and other Air Staff
and deputy assistant chief of staff agencies.<span class="calibre69"> </span>Only
10 percent of similar units assigned to a command are recommended annually. </p>

<p class="msonormal91">15.29.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Joint Meritorious Unit Award. </b>The
Joint Meritorious Unit Award was established 4 June 1981 and is awarded in the
name of the Secretary of Defense to recognize joint units and activities such
as a joint task force for meritorious achievement or service superior to that
normally expected. Air Force members assigned or attached to the joint unit or
joint task force awarded a Joint Meritorious Unit Award may be eligible to wear
the Joint Meritorious Unit Award ribbon. </p>

<p class="msonormal92"> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.29.3. <b class="calibre1">Achievement Awards.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal15">These awards recognize members for achieving or
meeting specific types of pre-established criteria or requirements of
qualification, service, performance, or conduct. Air Force members must meet
specific eligibility requirements and criteria. The Military Personnel Section
determines and verifies eligibility for the various types of achievement awards
and makes the appropriate entry into personnel records. The military personnel
section also procures and provides the initial issue of all achievement medals
and ribbons. Additional achievement awards can be found in AFI 36-2803. </p>

Air Force presents the Air Force Longevity Service Award every 4 years to
members who complete honorable active Federal military service. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.29.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Air Force Overseas Ribbon. </b>The Air Force
awards these ribbons to individuals who have completed an overseas (long or

<p class="msonormal10">15.29.4. <b class="calibre1">Special Trophies and Awards. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal15">The Air Force also sponsors various special
trophies and awards programs. Special trophies and awards are unique in that
the commanders of major commands, field operating agencies, and direct reporting
units must nominate individuals to compete for these awards. In most cases,
commanders submit nominations annually. The competition among the nominees is
keen. The commander’s nomination alone serves as a meaningful recognition
because nomination places the individual in competition with the best in the
Air Force or the Nation. Some examples of special trophies and awards are the
12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year Award and the Lance P. Sijan Award. AFI
36-2805<i class="calibre2">,</i> <i class="calibre2">Special Trophies and Awards</i>, lists various special
trophies and awards programs. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.29.5. <b class="calibre1">Foreign Decorations.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal21">The policy of the Department of Defense is that
awards from foreign governments may be accepted only in recognition of active
combat service or for outstanding or unusually meritorious performance only
upon receiving the approval of Department of the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.30.</b> <b class="calibre1">Decorations:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.30.1. <b class="calibre1">What Is a Decoration?</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal27">Formal recognition for personal excellence that
requires individual nomination and Air Force or Department of Defense approval.
Decorations are awarded in recognition for acts of valor, heroism, courage,
exceptional service, meritorious service, or outstanding achievement that
clearly place members above their peers and be of such importance that the
person cannot receive proper recognition in any other way. When an individual
is being considered for a decoration, the determining factors are level of responsibility,
achievements, accomplishments, manner of performance, and the impact of the
accomplishment. Each decoration has specific performance requirements for
award, and an individual may receive only one decoration for any act,
achievement, or period of service. Specific criteria for each decoration are in
AFI 36-2803. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.30.2. <b class="calibre1">Recommending an Individual for a Decoration.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal93">Any person, other than the individual being
recommended, having firsthand knowledge of the act, achievement, or service may
recommend or contribute to a decoration recommendation by providing evidence or
statements through the supervisor and chain of command of the member being
recommended. However, this obligation primarily falls on the immediate
supervisor. The three most common decorations are the Air Force Achievement
Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal, and the Meritorious Service Medal.
Every unit, wing, and major command has specific submission criteria and
procedures for these three decorations. For specific guidance, contact your
commander support staff or the force management section at the local force
support squadron or military personnel section. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 15H—Airman
Promotion System </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.31. Objective.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal31">The enlisted promotion system supports Department
of Defense directive 1304.20, <i class="calibre2">Enlisted Personnel Management System (EPMS),</i>
by helping to provide a visible, relatively stable career progression
opportunity over the long term; attracting, retaining, and motivating to career
service, the kinds and numbers of people the military services need; and
ensuring a reasonably uniform application of the principle of equal pay for
equal work among the military services. This section addresses the program
elements of the Regular Air Force Airman. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.32. Promotion Quotas.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal29">Promotion quotas for the top five grades (Staff
Sergeant through Chief Master Sergeant) are tied to fiscal-end strength and are
affected by funding limits, regulatory limits, and the number of projected
vacancies in specific grades. The Department of Defense limits the number of
Airmen the Air Force may have in the top five grades. Public law (Title 10,
United States Code, Section 517) limits the number of Airmen who may serve in
the Regular Air Force in the top two enlisted grades. The authorized daily
average of enlisted members on Regular Air Force (other than for training) in
pay grades E-8 and E9 in a fiscal year may not be more than 2.5 percent and
1.25, respectively. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.33. Promotion Cycles and General Eligibility
Requirements.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal40">The Air Force establishes promotion cycles to
ensure timely periodic promotions and to permit more accurate forecasting of
vacancies. Promotion cycles also balance the promotion administrative workload
and provide cutoff dates for eligibility. The basis for promotion eligibility
is proper skill level, sufficient time in grade, sufficient time in service,
and a recommendation by the immediate commander. Table 15.2 lists time in
service, time in grade, and significant dates of promotion. Table 15.3 lists
minimum eligibility requirements for each grade. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.34. Promotion Ineligibility. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal29">There are many reasons why an Airman may be
considered ineligible for promotion, such as approved retirement, declination
for extension or reenlistment, court-martial conviction, control roster action,
not recommended by the commander, failure to appear for scheduled testing
without a valid reason, absent without leave, etc. When individuals are
ineligible for promotion, they cannot test; cannot be considered if already
tested; and the projected promotion, if already selected, will be canceled.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.35. Promotion Sequence Numbers. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal34">The Air Force Personnel Center assigns promotion
sequence numbers to Airmen selected for promotion to Staff Sergeants through
Chief Master Sergeant based on date of rank, total active federal military
service date, and date of birth. Supplemental selectees are assigned promotion
sequence numbers of .9 (increment previously announced) or .5 (unannounced
future increment).<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal104"><b class="calibre1">15.36. Accepting Promotion. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal40">Airmen who accept a promotion are eligible for
reassignment and selective retraining in the projected grade.<span class="calibre3"> </span>Selectees to the grade of
Master Sergeant and Senior Master Sergeant will incur a 2-year Regular Air
Force service commitment from the effective date of promotion. In addition,
members with 18 or more years of total active federal military service will be
required to obtain 2-years retainability to serve the 2-year Regular Air Force
service commitment. Selectees to the grade of Chief Master Sergeant will incur
a 3-year Regular Air Force service commitment from the effective date of
promotion and will be required to obtain 3-years retainability (regardless of
total active federal military service) to serve the 3-year Regular Air Force
service commitment. Within 10 workdays after selection for promotion you are
required to accept or decline the promotion. </p>

promotion does not occur earlier than the first day of the month following the
month the Airman completes the required enlisted service. This applies if the

<p class="msonormal30">Airmen who fail to complete Phase 2 and/or Phase 3
enlisted PME distance learning prior to the established suspense are considered
ineligible for promotion. Airmen selected for promotion to Staff Sergeant must
complete in-resident enlisted professional military education (Airman
Leadership School) before assuming the rank of Staff Sergeant unless the member
is granted an enlisted professional military education waiver. There is no PME
requirement to sew on Technical Sergeant or Master Sergeant; however, the
Airman must not have a Promotion Eligibility States code 2 for failure to
complete Phase 2 or 3 distance learning by the suspense date. If they have a
Promotion Eligibility code 2 on or after promotion eligibility cut-off date
they are ineligible for the cycle.  Airmen pending promotion consideration to
the rank of Senior Master Sergeant must complete Phase 3 Senior NCO Academy or
equivalent/sister service/international enlisted professional military
education (correspondence or in-residence) on or before the promotion
eligibility cut-off date to remain eligible for promotion. In the case that an
Airman has a promotion sequence number and has not completed their required
distance learning by the suspense date, he or she will be placed into a
promotion withhold status. The withhold status will be removed upon course
completion or it will expire at the end of the promotion cycle where the line

First Class.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal87">The Air Force normally promotes eligible Airmen
recommended by their commander on a noncompetitive basis. An Airman Basic must
have 6 months of time in grade to be eligible for promotion to Airman. The time
in grade requirement for an Airman to be eligible for promotion to Airman First
Class is 10 months. There are different phase points for individuals graduating
from basic military training as Airman or Airman First Class that correspond
with their earlier promotions. Individuals initially enlisting for a period of
6 years are promoted from Airman Basic or Airman to Airman First Class upon
completion of either technical training, or 20 weeks of technical training
(start date of the 20-week period is the date of basic military training
completion), whichever occurs first.  </p>

<p class="msonormal124"><span class="calibre4">15.39.2.<span class="calibre59">  </span></span><b class="calibre1">Senior Airman.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal20">The Air Force promotes Airman First Class to Senior
Airman with either 36 months of time in service and 20 months of time in grade
or 28 months of time in grade, whichever occurs first. They must possess a
3-skill level and be recommended by their unit commander. Airman First Class
may compete for early advancement to Senior Airman if they meet the minimum
eligibility criteria outlined in the aforementioned Table 15.3. If promoted to
Senior Airman below the zone, their promotion effective date would be 6 months
before their fully qualified date. Individuals are considered in the month
(December, March, June, or September) before the quarter (January through
March, April through June, July through September, or October through December)
they are eligible for below the zone promotion. </p>

Technical Sergeant.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal41">Promotion to the grades of Staff Sergeant through
Technical Sergeant occurs under one of two programs: the Weighted Airman
Promotion System or Stripes for Exceptional Performers. </p>

<p class="msonormal17"><span class="calibre4">15.39.3.1.<span class="calibre59">  </span></span><b class="calibre1">Weighted
Airman Promotion System.</b> Airmen compete and test under Weighted Airman
Promotion System in their control Air Force specialty code held on the
promotion eligibility cutoff date. The Weighted Airman Promotion System
consists of up to four weighted factors: specialty knowledge test, promotion
fitness examination, decorations, and enlisted performance reports. Each of
these factors is “weighted” or assigned points based on its importance relative
to promotion. The promotion fitness examination and specialty knowledge test
account for 200 points. The promotion fitness examination contains a wide range
of Air Force knowledge, while the specialty knowledge test covers Air Force
specialty code broad technical knowledge. Table 15.4 shows how to calculate
points. The Air Force makes promotions under Weighted Airman Promotion System
within each Air Force specialty code, not across them. This means those
eligible compete for promotion only with those individuals currently working in
their Air Force specialty code. Selectees are individuals with the highest
scores in each Air Force specialty code, within the quota limitations. If more
than one individual has the same total score at the cutoff point, the Air Force
promotes everyone with that score. </p>

<p class="msonormal17"><span class="calibre4">15.39.3.2.<span class="calibre59">  </span></span><b class="calibre1">Stripes
for Exceptional Performers Program.</b> The Stripes for Exceptional Performers
Program, established in 1980, is designed to meet those unique circumstances
that, in the commander’s judgment, clearly warrant promotion. Under Stripes for
Exceptional Performers, commanders of major commands and field operating
agencies and senior officers in organizations with large enlisted populations
may promote a limited number of Airmen with exceptional potential to the grades
of Staff Sergeant through Technical Sergeant (each major command determines
their own procedures and Stripes for Exceptional Performers selection levels).
The commander must ensure personnel who are promoted meet eligibility
requirements including completion of the appropriate enlisted professional
military education. An individual may not receive more than one promotion under
any combination of promotion programs within a 12-month period. (<b class="calibre1">Exception:</b>
A Senior Airman must serve 6 months of time in grade before being promoted to
Staff Sergeant.) Isolated acts or specific achievements should not be the sole
basis for promotion under this program. Stripes for Exceptional Performers
promotion opportunities are limited, therefore Commanders are encouraged to
recognize and promote their exemplary performers who meet the minimum promotion
eligibility criteria. Date of rank and effective date is the date the selection
authority announces the promotion. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">Consideration for promotion to the grades of Master
Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant is done through a
two-phased process. Phase I is similar to the Weighted Airman Promotion System
evaluation for Staff Sergeant and Technical Sergeant, although some promotion
factors differ. Phase II consists of a central evaluation board held at Air
Force Personnel Center using the whole-person concept. All promotion eligibles
for each cycle are reviewed by the central evaluation board. The Air Force
selects senior NCOs with the highest scores in each Air Force specialty code
for promotion, within the quota limitations. If more than one senior NCO has
the same total score at the cutoff point, the Air Force promotes everyone with
that score. Table 15.5 (Master Sergeant cycle) and Table 15.6 (Senior Master
Sergeant/Chief Master Sergeant cycles) detail how points are calculated. </p>

Responsibilities and Score Notices. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal15">Preparing for promotion testing is solely an
individual responsibility. Weighted Airman Promotion System score notices are a
means to give Airmen a report of their relative standing in the promotion
consideration process and should never be provided to or used by anyone other
than the individual and his or her commander. An Airman’s scores cannot be
disclosed without the Airman’s written consent. Commanders support staff, first
sergeants, supervisors, etc., are not authorized access to an Airman’s Weighted
Airman Promotion System scores. The commander has the specific duty to notify
Airmen of promotion selection or nonselection results and may need to review
their score notices to determine status. Commanders must restrict their use of
the scores to notification and advisory counseling on behalf of the Airman and
must not allow further dissemination of scores. Individuals may retrieve a copy
of their score notice on the virtual military personnel flight after the
initial promotion selection for the current cycle. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">The Airman Advancement Division, Joint Base San
Antonio-Randolph, Texas, produces all Air Force enlisted promotion tests, which
are written by Airmen for Airmen. Although the tests are developed at Airman
Advancement Division, senior NCOs from across the Air Force travel to Joint
Base San Antonio-Randolph to develop and validate the test questions. For
specialty knowledge tests, senior NCO subject-matter experts are selected based
on their specialties and job experience. For Promotion Fitness and United
States Air Force Supervisory Examinations, Chief Master Sergeants are selected
based on Air Force demographics, extensive experience, and major command
representation. Test development specialists provide psychometric and
developmental expertise required to ensure the tests are credible, valid, and
fair to all examinees. All enlisted promotion tests are revised annually. </p>

<p class="msonormal124"><span class="calibre4">15.42.2.<span class="calibre59">  </span></span><b class="calibre1">Test Development
Process. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal20">Airman Advancement Division test development
specialist’s work closely with Air Force career field managers to stay abreast
of changes affecting career fields which may impact promotion test development.
At the beginning of a test development project, the most current tests are administered
to the subject-matter experts. This gives subjectmatter experts the point of
view of the test takers and helps them evaluate how the test content relates to
performance in their specialties. They carefully check the references of each
question. Only after this is accomplished do they begin developing new test
questions. Every question on a test comes from one of the publications listed
in the <i class="calibre2">Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog</i>.  </p>

<p class="msonormal124"><span class="calibre4">15.42.3.<span class="calibre59">  </span></span><b class="calibre1">Specialty
Knowledge Tests. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">Specialty knowledge tests measure important job knowledge
required of Staff Sergeants, Technical Sergeants, and Master Sergeants in a
particular specialty. Senior NCOs from each career field, guided by test
development specialists, develop tests for their Air Force specialty using the
specific career field education and training plan, occupational analysis data,
and their experiences to tie test content to important tasks performed in the
specialty. </p>

<p class="msonormal124"><span class="calibre4">15.42.4.<span class="calibre59">  </span></span><b class="calibre1">Promotion Fitness
Examination and United States Air Force Supervisory Examination. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">The Promotion Fitness Examination measures military
and supervisory knowledge required of Staff Sergeants, Technical Sergeants, and
Master Sergeants. The United States Air Force Supervisory Examination evaluates
practical military, supervisory, and managerial knowledge required for the top
two non-commissioned grades. Chief Master Sergeants from across the Air Force,
guided by test development specialists, develop these tests using the Military
Knowledge and Testing System chart and their experience. </p>

Administration and Scoring.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal40">Promotion tests are administered to all Airmen
competing for promotion to the grades of Staff Sergeant through Chief Master
Sergeant. To the greatest extent possible, test administration procedures are
standardized to ensure fairness for all members competing for promotion. Strict
procedures are used for handling, storing, and transmitting test booklets and
answer sheets to preclude the possibility of loss or compromise. All promotion
tests are electronically scored at Air Force Personnel Center following
thorough quality control steps to ensure accurate test results for each member.
The test scanning and scoring process contains many safeguards to verify
accuracy, including hand-scoring a percentage of answer sheets (pulled
randomly), and physically reviewing answer sheets. Because of the difficulty of
the tests, some individuals may receive scores they believe do not reflect
their study efforts. Likewise, some members may receive the same score as the
previous year. Information concerning verification of test scores is contained
in AFI 36-2605. </p>

<p class="msonormal122"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre4">15.44.<span class="calibre59">  </span></span></b><b class="calibre1">Air Force
Enlisted Promotion Test Compromise.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal160">Group study (two or more people) is strictly
prohibited. This prohibition protects the integrity of the promotion testing
program by ensuring promotion test scores are a reflection of each member’s
individual knowledge. Enlisted personnel who violate these prohibitions are
subject to prosecution under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice
for violating a lawful general regulation. Conviction can result in a
dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement
for up to 2 years. Information concerning enlisted promotion test compromise is
contained in AFI 36-2605. In addition to group study, specific test compromise
situations include, but are not limited to: </p>

<p class="msonormal31"><span class="calibre4">15.44.1.<span class="calibre59">  </span></span>Discussing
the contents of a specialty knowledge test, promotion fitness examination, or
United States Air Force supervisory examination with anyone other than the test
control officer or test examiner. Written inquiries or complaints about a test
are processed through the test control officer. </p>

<p class="msonormal31"><span class="calibre4">15.44.2.<span class="calibre59">  </span></span>Sharing
pretests or lists of test questions recalled from a current or previous
specialty knowledge test, promotion fitness examination, or United States Air

highlighted study reference material; and commercial study guides with other
individuals. </p>

<p class="msonormal31"><span class="calibre4">15.44.3.<span class="calibre59">  </span></span>Although
the Air Force does not recommend or support commercial study guides, they may
be used to prepare for promotion testing. Placing commercial study guide
software on government computers is prohibited because doing so implies Air
Force sanctioning of the guides. Additionally, there are prohibitions against
developing commercial study guides.  </p>

<p class="msonormal161"><b class="calibre1">Note:</b> Training designed to improve general military
knowledge, such as NCO of the quarter or Senior Airman below the zone boards,
does not constitute group study as long as the intent of the training is not to
study for promotion tests. Likewise, training to improve general study habits
or test-taking skills is permissible if the training does not focus on
preparing for promotion tests. However, individuals may not collaborate in any
way or at any time to prepare for promotion testing. </p>

Promotion Actions.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal9">Air Force Personnel Center conducts in-system
promotion consideration on a monthly basis. Supplemental evaluation boards for
promotion to the grades of Master Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant, and Chief
Master Sergeant are conducted on a semiannual basis. Remember, supplemental
promotion consideration may not be granted if the error or omission appeared on
the data verification record, or in the senior NCO selection record, located in
the personnel records display application, and the individual did not take the
necessary steps to correct the error prior to promotion selection or prior to
the evaluation board. Fully documented supplemental consideration requests, to
include proof of corrective or follow-up actions taken by the individual to
correct the error, are submitted to the military personnel section, in writing,
with the recommendation of the individual’s unit commander. The military
personnel section forwards the request to Air Force Personnel Center for final
approval. </p>

<p class="msonormal31"><span class="calibre4">15.46.1.<span class="calibre59">  </span></span>The Air
Education and Training Command, Occupational Analysis Division houses the Air
Force Occupational Analysis Program, governed by AFI 36-2623, <i class="calibre2">Occupational
Analysis</i>. The purpose of the Occupational Analysis Program is to equip
senior leaders and managers of Air Force personnel and training programs with
objective, fact-based information about Air Force occupations and civilian
occupational series. The role of occupational analysis is to conduct
occupational studies; develop survey instruments, analyze the data collected,
and provide actionable Air Force specialty information. Decision makers
associated with training program responsibilities for an Air Force specialty
use occupational survey data to establish, validate, and adjust training.
Decision makers associated with personnel programs for an Air Force specialty
use occupational survey data to justify or change personnel policies and to
refine, or maintain occupational structures. Occupational survey data is
provided to the Air Education and Training Command, Airman Advancement Division
to ensure enlisted promotion tests are relevant, fair, and reliable.   </p>

<p class="msonormal162"><span class="calibre4">15.46.2.<span class="calibre59">  </span></span>As noted
in AFPD 36-26, <i class="calibre2">Total Force Development</i>, paragraph 1.1.6., the Department

develop Air Force training programs. The Occupational Analysis Program is the <b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">singularly
unique Air Force entity</i></b> which collects, analyzes, and reports the
job/occupational performance factors which are defined, measured, and applied
within Instructional System Development. The Occupational Analysis Program is
integral to providing an objective and factual orientation for three force
development tenets inherent to AFPD 36-26, <i class="calibre2">Total Force Development</i>: (1)
capabilities-based training (used to identify knowledge needed and specific
tasks necessitating training to meet job performance requirements); (2)
personnel classification and utilization (used to identify tasks performed at
each career stage and to validate occupational structures); and (3) promotion
testing (used to identify operationally relevant duties and tasks for test
development to promote and retain the best Airmen). (Figure 15.3.)   <span class="calibre68"><img border="0" id="Group 901417" src="image001.png" class="calibre211"/></span><b class="calibre1">Figure

<p class="msonormal12"> </p>

<p class="msonormal31"><span class="calibre4">15.46.3.<span class="calibre59">  </span></span>The
Occupational Analysis Division conducts occupational studies on enlisted Air
Force specialties on a periodic basis, typically a 3- to 4-year cycle, and upon
request (if out of cycle). Special studies, to include officer Air Force
specialties and civilian occupational series, are conducted upon request.
Career field leaders and subject matter experts are key to the process in
developing the content of the survey instruments. Occupational surveys are administered
to all eligible personnel in the targeted Air Force specialty or civilian
occupational series through direct email (AFNet). </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.46.3.1. Data Presentation and Applications.   </p>

<p class="msonormal90"><span class="calibre4">15.46.3.1.1.<span class="calibre59"> 
</span></span>Occupational survey results are reported in occupational analysis
reports. Occupational analysis reports data includes information on the duties
and responsibilities performed by career field members in the form of task
statements and duty areas. Collectively, this data describe the work performed
by career field members in their jobs (Air Force Specialty Code) and throughout
each stage of their career. Additionally, occupational survey data provides
supporting information on when and how members should be trained to perform
their jobs. Enlisted career field training personnel use occupational survey
data (e.g., skill-level member data) as the primary source of empirical data to
support decisions on <i class="calibre2">what</i> type of training is needed, <i class="calibre2">who</i> needs
the training, and to what <i class="calibre2">depth</i> the training should be taught...<i class="calibre2">Right
Skills * Right Time * Right Place</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal90"><span class="calibre4">15.46.3.1.2.<span class="calibre59"> 
</span></span>Career field leaders at specialty training requirements team
sessions and/or utilization and training workshops are primary users of
occupational survey data. These conferences of career field leaders, and
training and personnel specialists evaluate existing training requirements for
relevancy and efficacy. Based on occupational survey data, conference attendees
make changes to career field education and training plans, career development
course content, and the Air Force Specialty/Air Force Specialty Code
description of duties, responsibilities, and qualifications as depicted in
their respective Air Force Classification Directory (Enlisted. officer, or
civilian Office of Personnel Management Handbook). </p>

<p class="msonormal90"><span class="calibre4">15.46.3.1.3.<span class="calibre59"> 
</span></span>Occupational survey data is also crucial in the development and
validation of specialty knowledge test content—integral to the Weighted Airman
Promotion System. Occupational survey data are the objective source of job
information available to specialty knowledge test development teams to
construct promotion examinations that meet the requirements for relevance,
fairness, and reliability. The Occupational Analysis Program produces a
collective measure of occupational survey data which identifies mission
essential tasks (areas of work) that suggests this data should serve as the
basis for relevant promotion test content. </p>

<p class="msonormal90"><span class="calibre4">15.46.3.1.4.<span class="calibre59"> 
</span></span>The Occupational Analysis process and data application are
conducted IAW AFI 36-2623, <i class="calibre2">Occupational Analysis</i> and supported by AFPD

</span></span>All career field members have pivotal roles with the constructive
outcomes of occupational studies. Airmen of a career field being surveyed must
devote the necessary time and commitment in completing their assigned

<p class="msonormal4">15.48.3. The board considers academic education
completed on or before the promotion eligibility cutoff date. Up to three
academic education levels can be reflected on the senior NCO evaluation brief.
When the academic education level is updated in the personnel data system, the
promotion file is updated and a new data verification record and evaluation
brief is produced to reflect the change. If the Community College of the Air
Force degree was awarded by Community College of the Air Force or any other accredited
college requirements were completed before the promotion eligibility cutoff
date but the evaluation brief was completed within 10 days of the board
convening date, the education services office will update the personnel data
system. The individual must notify the Air Force Personnel Center by message of
this update. This information is then used to post the senior NCO evaluation
brief filed in the senior NCO selection folder. Promotion eligible Airmen are
responsible for ensuring this data is posted on their data verification record
and evaluation brief. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">15.48.4. The promotion eligibility cutoff date is
used to determine content of the selection folder and information on promotion
evaluation briefs. The number of enlisted performance reports included is
limited to those reports closed out 5 years before the promotion eligibility
cutoff date (maximum of 10 enlisted performance reports). Approved decorations,
resubmissions, or decorations being upgraded must be submitted and placed into
official channels before the selection date. The data shown on the senior NCO
evaluation brief includes the member’s name, social security number, grade,
date of rank, Air Force specialty information, service dates (to include
projected retirement date), academic education level, decorations, duty
information, duty history, and professional military education/Community
College of the Air Force completion.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.49.</b> <b class="calibre1">Evaluation Board. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal161">The evaluation board is very important because the
evaluation board accounts for over half the total score. Understanding how
board members are selected, the evaluation board process, and those areas
considered by board members can provide valuable insight into what is required
to get promoted. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.49.1.<b class="calibre1"> Selection of Board Members. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal21">The number of promotion eligible personnel
identified by major command and Air Force specialty codes determines the number
and career field backgrounds of the board members. Board members are divided
into panels, each consisting of one colonel and two Chief Master Sergeants. The
board president is always a general officer. Before evaluating records, board
members are briefed on the task objective, eligible population profile, and
selection folder content. Board members are then sworn to complete the board’s
task without prejudice or partiality. They also participate in an extensive
trial-run process to ensure scoring consistency before evaluating any “live”
records. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.49.2.<b class="calibre1"> Areas the Board Considers. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal14">The board looks at performance, education, breadth
of experience, job responsibility, professional competence, specific
achievements, and leadership. In each area, the individual has control over the
information the board reviews. Individuals therefore—not board members—are
responsible for their own promotions by ensuring the board receives the most
current updates. </p>

<p class="msonormal27">15.49.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Performance.</b> The evaluation board
reviews all enlisted performance reports for the 5 years preceding the promotion
eligibility cutoff date. The board members consider all aspects of the enlisted
performance report— job description (key duties, tasks, and responsibilities),
individual rating factors, periods of supervision, overall evaluations, levels
of endorsements, and each narrative word picture. If the person is an
exceptional performer, the enlisted performance reports should convey to the
board that he or she has demonstrated the highest qualities required of a
leader and manager. </p>

<p class="msonormal202">15.49.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> Education.</b> When considering educational
opportunities, enlisted members should focus on a degree program that
complements their career field and enhances their ability to do their job. When
the board evaluates academic education as part of the whole-person assessment, the
most important consideration should be the degree to which the education
enhances the member’s potential to serve in the next higher grade. </p>

<p class="msonormal202">15.49.2.3.<b class="calibre1"> Breadth of Experience.</b> This factor
refers to the individual’s overall professional background, experience, and
knowledge gained during his or her career to the present. Board members
consider knowledge and practical experience in areas other than the current Air
Force specialty code. If the eligible individual remained in one career field,
board members consider whether he or she had wide exposure across the career
field. Board members also consider potential to fill other types of jobs, as
well as supervisory and managerial experience. </p>

<p class="msonormal203">15.49.2.4.<b class="calibre1"> Job Responsibility.</b> This factor does not
refer entirely to the career field’s command-level positions, although
experience at this level is a consideration. Many base-level jobs demand just
as much of an individual as jobs at higher command levels. Consideration is
primarily given to what was asked of the individual and how well the individual
accomplished the task. Did the job require significant decisions, or was it a
job in which the individual routinely carried out the decisions of others? Is
the individual a proven, effective leader, responsible for directing the work
of others, or is the person responsible only for his or her own performance? </p>

<p class="msonormal86">15.49.2.5.<b class="calibre1"> Professional Competence.</b> What do
rating and endorsing officials say about the individual’s expertise? Is it
truly outstanding? How much does the individual know about the job, and how
well does he or she accomplish it? The Air Force Chief of Staff has emphasized
the need for careful selection of individuals for promotion to the senior NCO
grades. Therefore, those selected must be the best qualified. They must have
sufficient leadership and managerial experience to prepare them for the
challenges they, and the Air Force, face. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">15.49.2.6.<b class="calibre1"> Specific Achievements.</b> These are
often recognized in the form of awards and decorations. However, many other
significant accomplishments are often addressed in the enlisted performance
report’s narrative comments. Such recognition, either in the form of
decorations or narrative comments, can help board members identify truly
outstanding performers. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">15.49.2.7.<b class="calibre1"> Leadership.</b> Board members use
their judgment, expertise, and maturity when reviewing records to assess a
member’s potential to serve in a higher grade. In particular, board members
evaluate leadership potential. How well does he or she manage, lead, and
interact with peers and subordinates? What have rating officials said about the
person’s leadership qualities and potential? What haven’t they said? </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.50.</b> <b class="calibre1">Evaluation Process: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.50.1.<b class="calibre1"> Trial Run.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">As previously mentioned, board members are given
two selected sets of records to score as a practice exercise before the actual
scoring process. Using the whole-person concept, they score the records using
secret ballots. This process helps establish a scoring standard they can apply
consistently throughout the board process. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.50.2.<b class="calibre1"> Scoring: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">15.50.2.1. After the trial run is completed and
discussed, panels begin the actual scoring of live records. The same panel
evaluates all eligibles competing in a chief enlisted manager code or Air Force
specialty code. Each panel member scores each record, using a 6- to 10-point
scale and half-point increments. An individual’s record may receive a panel
composite score (3 members) from a minimum of 18 (6-6-6) to a maximum of 30
(10-10-10) points. The composite score (18 to 30 points) is later multiplied by
a factor of 15, resulting in a total board score (270 to 450). Using a secret
ballot, panel members score the record individually with no discussion. Records
are given to each panel member, and after they are scored, the ballots are
given directly to a recorder. This ensures each panel member has scored each
record independently. </p>

<p class="msonormal204">15.50.2.2. A record scored with a difference of more than 1
point between any of the panel members (for example, 8.5, 8.0, and 7.0) is
termed a split vote and is returned to the panel for resolution. At this point,
all panel members may discuss the record openly among themselves. This allows
them to state why they scored the record as they did. Only those panel members
directly involved in the split may change their scores. If panel members cannot
come to an agreement on the split vote, they give the record to the board
president for resolution. This ensures consistency of scoring and eliminates
the possibility that one panel member will have a major impact (positive or
negative) on an individual’s board score. </p>

<p class="msonormal21">15.50.2.3. Actual scores will vary between panels;
the specific reason why certain panels scored the way they did cannot be
determined because this is a subjective decision. However, because a single
panel reviews each chief enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code, all
records within a chief enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code are
evaluated under the same standard. Some panels may award high scores, while
others may award low ones. Therefore, whether a panel scores “easy” or “hard”
is not significant. The important part of the final board score is how one
eligible compares to his or her peers in the final order of merit. This allows
each eligible to see how competitive he or she was. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">15.50.2.4. Because each board is completely
independent, board members do not know how an individual scored or ranked
during the previous cycle. Each board arrives at their own scoring standard.
However, as long as everyone competing in a chief enlisted manager code or Air
Force specialty code is looked at under the same standard, fair and equitable
consideration is ensured. A number of factors affect board scores from year to
year—new panel members with different thought processes, previous promotion
eligible with changed or improved records, and a large pool of new eligibles.
As a result, board scores do vary (often significantly) from one board to the
next. </p>

<p class="msonormal205">15.50.2.5. Board members do not
have access to the weighted scores of individuals competing for promotion.
Their primary concern is to align all eligible in a relative order of merit,
based on their panel score, within their chief enlisted manager code or Air
Force specialty code. When board members leave, they do not know who was
selected. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">They only know they have reviewed and scored each record
within the standard that evolved from the trial run. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.50.3.<b class="calibre1"> Not Fully Qualified Process: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">15.50.3.1. A process associated with enlisted
promotion boards often misunderstood is the not fully qualified process. As
previously stated, senior NCO evaluation board members use the whole-person
concept to align promotion eligible in a relative order of merit within their
chief enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code based on the quality of
each promotion eligible’s senior NCO evaluation record. Also, board members are
formally charged to ensure individuals are not only best qualified, but also
fully qualified to assume the responsibilities of the next higher grade. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">15.50.3.2. If the board determines an individual is
not fully qualified based on an evaluation of the record, the individual is
rendered not fully qualified for promotion. In this case, Air Force Personnel
Center removes the individual from promotion consideration and deactivates his
or her promotion record, rendering the individual ineligible for promotion. The
parent major command and military personnel section are then notified of the
board’s decision in writing. The parent major command must immediately notify
the individual through the unit commander. The board is not allowed to disclose
the exact rationale for their findings. However, factors contributing to the
decision can be as general as an overall noncompetitive record when compared to
peers or as specific as a demonstrated substandard performance and disciplinary
problems. Additionally, the chief enlisted manager may have a very small number
of eligibles and the board has exercised the authority to prevent promotion by
default. In any event, the member is ineligible for that cycle. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.50.4.<b class="calibre1"> Post-Board Processing.</b>  </p>

<p class="msonormal87">After the board is finished, the weighted factor
scores are combined with the board scores. This completely electronic operation
builds an order of merit listing by total score within each chief enlisted
manager code or Air Force specialty code, and the overall promotion quota is
then applied to each list. After the selection results are approved, the data
is transmitted to the military personnel section. Questions regarding the
Master Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant, and Chief Master Sergeant promotion
selection process should be directed to the military personnel section career
development element. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.50.5.<b class="calibre1"> Score Notice. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal206">All eligible personnel receive a score notice that
reports how they compare to their peers in their chief enlisted manager code or
Air Force specialty code in the specific promotion cycle. To determine weak
areas, individuals can also compare their scores with the promotion statistics
available in the military personnel section and/or posted on the Internet via
the virtual military personnel flight. Personnel can access the virtual
military personnel flight through the Air Force Personnel Center Web site at <a href="https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">https://gum</span></a><a href="https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">-</span></a><a href="https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">crm.csd.disa.mil</span></a><a href="https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre216">.</span></a><b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">15.51.1. Reviewing the data verification record and
senior NCO selection folder and taking prompt action to correct any errors
provides the evaluation board the most accurate career assessment. However, if
data errors or omissions occur, supplemental promotion consideration may be
granted. Supplemental consideration is not granted if the error or omission
appeared on the data verification record or in the automated records management
system/personnel records display application and appropriate corrective and
follow-up action was not taken prior to the board convening. </p>

<p class="msonormal161">15.51.2. Table 15.7 provides specific information
concerning supplemental consideration. Requests for supplemental consideration
are submitted in writing containing the unit commander’s recommendation and
processed through the military personnel section.<b class="calibre1"> </b>In addition, the
military personnel section can answer questions about the data verification
record, which may eliminate the need for supplemental consideration. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.52.1.<b class="calibre1"> General Responsibilities and Score Notices. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Preparing for promotion testing is solely an
individual responsibility. Weighted Airman Promotion System score notices are a
means to give Airmen a report of their relative standing in the promotion
consideration process and should never be provided to or used by anyone other
than the individual and his or her commander. An Airman’s scores cannot be
disclosed without the Airman’s written consent. Commanders support staff, first
sergeants, supervisors, etc., are not authorized access to an Airman’s Weighted
Airman Promotion System scores. The commander has the specific duty to notify
Airmen of promotion selection or non-selection results and may need to review
their score notices to determine status. Commanders must restrict their use of
the scores to notification and advisory counseling on behalf of the Airman and
must not allow further dissemination of scores. Individuals may retrieve a copy
of their score notice on the virtual military personnel flight after the
initial promotion selection for the current cycle. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.52.2.<b class="calibre1"> Individual Responsibilities. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal41">Personal involvement is critical. As a minimum, all Airmen
testing must: </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.52.2.1. Know their promotion eligibility status. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.52.2.2. Maintain their specialty and military
qualifications to retain their eligibility. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.52.2.3. Use a self-initiated program of individual
study and effort to advance their career under Weighted Airman Promotion
System. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.52.2.4. Obtain all current study references for a
particular promotion cycle. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.52.2.5. Review the annual Enlisted Promotions
References and Requirements Catalog to check availability and receipt of
correct study references. </p>

<p class="msonormal87">15.52.2.6. Be prepared to test the first day of the
testing window and throughout the testing cycle. Members who will be
unavailable during the entire testing cycle due to a scheduled temporary duty
must be prepared to test prior to temporary duty departure even if the
temporary duty departure is before the first day of the testing cycle. Airman
may opt to test early provided the correct test booklets are available. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.52.2.7. Ensure they receive at least 60 days of access
to study materials prior to testing. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">15.52.2.8. (For Master Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant
and Chief Master Sergeant promotion eligibles) Ensure their selection folder at
Air Force Personnel Center is accurate and complete. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.52.3.<b class="calibre1"> Data Verification Record.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal216">The military personnel section will instruct eligible
Airmen to obtain and review his or her data verification record on virtual
military personnel flight to verify the data used in the promotion selection
process. Each eligible Airman must review the data verification record and the
master personnel records in the Automated Records Management System/Personnel
Records Display Application and report any errors to the military personnel
section. If an error is noted, the Airman must immediately contact his or her
military personnel section for assistance. The military personnel section will
update Military Personnel Data System with the correct data. Except for
updating enlisted performance report data, each change will produce an updated
promotion brief at Air Force Personnel Center and update the data verification
record on virtual military personnel flight. The Airman’s receipt of the
updated data verification record ensures changes were made. Airmen should
verify the updated information. Supplemental promotion consideration may not be
granted if an error or omission appeared on the data verification record and
the individual took no corrective or follow-up action before the promotion
selection date for Staff Sergeant through Master Sergeant, and before the
original evaluation board for Senior Master Sergeant through Chief Master
Sergeant. Individuals may retrieve a copy of their data verification record on
virtual military personnel flight before the initial promotion selection for
the current cycle. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section
15J—Civilian Personnel Management and Programs </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.53. Civilian Personnel Services. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal217">The Air Force provides most
civilian personnel services from two sources: installation civilian personnel
flights, usually located in the force support squadron, and Air Force Personnel
Center. Air Force activities collocated on an Air Force installation with a
civilian personnel flights, or within the same locality, are to be served by
that civilian personnel flights.  When an activity is not collocated or located
near a civilian personnel flights, services are to be provided by the nearest
civilian personnel flights. Civilian Personnel Sections must service all
civilian employees to ensure they are all included in the Air Force Civilian
Personnel Program. Exceptions to the civilian personnel servicing arrangements
are to be submitted to Air Force/A1C for approval due to impact on Reduction in
Force retention and bargaining unit representation.  </p>

<p class="msonormal8">This includes arrangements to centralize or decentralize
civilian personnel servicing arrangements.  <b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.54. Civilian Resource Management: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal31">15.54.1. While military pay is centrally managed by
Headquarters United States Air Force, civilian pay is a budget line item at
major command, field operating agency, and installation level, as well as at
Headquarters United States Air Force. The availability of performance payout
and numbers of authorized civilian positions comprise the base line for
civilian employment levels. Civilian Pay funds are needed for civilian
overtime; performance awards; special act awards; notable achievement awards,
retention, recruitment, and relocation bonuses; student loan repayment program,
seasonal and longerterm overhires; and voluntary separation incentive payments
to minimize involuntary reduction-in-force separations and severance pay for
affected employees as the result of reduction in force. Accurate requirement
projections and development of employment plans are critical to support the
workload demand within budget, while executing work years, end strength and
civilian pay resource.   </p>

<p class="msonormal8">15.54.2. Civilian resource management is a team effort.
Commanders and senior leaders depend on human resource officers, financial
managers, and manpower officers to recommend effective use of employees, funds,
and manpower authorizations to meet mission requirements. Major commands and
installations use a corporate board structure, meeting at least quarterly, to
manage annual appropriations, revolving funds, or reimbursements used for
civilian employment costs. </p>

<p class="msonormal29">15.54.3. When funds are available, civilian
overhire positions can be established to handle peak workloads, recurring
annual programs, military manning shortfalls, or other short-notice
requirements that cannot be met through normal manpower requirements or
personnel assignment processes. Most overhire positions are filled using
temporary appointments (not to exceed 1 year). If the workload continues beyond
a year, term appointments of up to 5 years may be used. Permanent appointments
to overhire positions are unusual, although a permanent employee may be placed
in an overhire position in a reduction-in-force. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.55. Job Descriptions: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal37">15.55.1. Civilian employees, except those above
grade General Schedule-15 do not have a rank. Instead, they take the grade of
the position they occupy. Since the position is graded, not the employee,
detailed written job descriptions are the basis for determining pay,
qualification requirements, performance expectations, and appraisal ratings. </p>

<p class="msonormal160">15.55.2. Position descriptions historically have
covered duties, responsibilities, and supervisory controls. The Air Force has
expanded the scope of core personnel documents to include performance
standards, qualifications required for recruitment, and training requirements
for a new employee in the position. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">15.55.3. Supervisors are responsible for core personnel
documents accuracy, and for implementing standard core personnel documents from
a growing library of these documents. Air Force Personnel Center/DPIC (formally
AFMA/MAH) coordinates standard core personnel document content with appropriate
Headquarters United States Air Force functional representatives before issuing
new standard core personnel documents. Supervisors who select standard core
personnel documents save the time required to write a new document and the time
a position classification specialist would need to determine the correct pay
plan or schedule, occupation series or code, and grade. Standard core personnel
documents can also be used as templates for a unique core personnel documents
that requires a new classification analysis. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">15.55.4. Air Force civilian personnel sections with
relatively large numbers of serviced civilian personnel retain position
classification authority and responsibilities until they transition to Air
Force Personnel Center/DPIC. Air Force Personnel Center/DPIC performs
classification support for installations with smaller civilian employee
populations. From either source, supervisors can seek assistance in developing
core personnel documents or selecting or modifying standard core personnel
documents. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.56. Filling Jobs: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal40">15.56.1. Vacant civilian positions are filled based
on an organization’s needs using a variety of recruitment sources and 
appointing authorities consistent with applicable laws, regulations, directives
and policies as established by the Office of Personnel Management, Department
of Defense, and Department of the Air Force. Referral and selection priorities
must be observed when filling competitive service positions. Employees with
mandatory selection or priority referral rights normally include those
adversely affected by reduction-in-force through involuntary separation or
demotion. These priorities may also include transfer of function declinations
or transfer of work outside the commuting area, overseas returnees,
reduction-in-force reclassification, civilian spouses, or spouses of Regular
Air Force military following a change in duty location. Supervisors work in
concert with their servicing Human Resource specialist in the civilian
personnel sections or Air Force Personnel Center to determine appropriate
recruitment sources. A vacancy for competitive fill actions is announced,
candidates are screened by Air Force Personnel Center, and one or more lists of
candidates are referred to the supervisor. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">15.56.2. Based on their qualifying experience
and/or education, civilians can enter civil service at different pay grade
levels. The competitive staffing process used by the Air Force and other
Federal agencies determines the relative qualifications of the candidates and
refers only the best qualified for selection. Office of Personnel Management
provides agencies with qualification standards written broadly for
government-wide application. The standards are covered by either a Group
Standard (multiple occupations) or by Individual Occupation. The Group
Standards cover occupations under Professional and Scientific, Administrative
and Management, Technical and Medical Support, Clerical and Administrative
Support and Student Trainee positions. Some occupations have education
requirements identified in the qualification standards. The level of education
is dependent upon the duties and the grade of the position. Many jobs in
professional and related occupations require a 4-year college degree. Some of
these occupations including engineers, physicians and surgeons, and biological
and physical scientists require a bachelor’s or higher degree in a specific
field of study. 5 United States Code, Section 3308 prohibits requiring
education for positions that are competed, unless Office of Personnel
Management has determined the duties of a scientific, technical, or
professional position cannot be performed by an individual who does not have
the prescribed minimum education. The minimum qualification requirements are
listed on job announcements which may include specific job-related work
experience, education level, medical or physical standards, training, security,
certifications and/or licensure requirements. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">15.56.3. Competitive placements require
collaboration between supervisors and human resource specialists at the
civilian personnel sections or the Air Force Personnel Center. Human resource
specialists advise supervisors regarding recruitment sources. The minimum area
of consideration includes Department of Defense-wide, Transfer and
Reinstatement eligibles for all locally and centrally managed permanent
positions. Exceptions to the standard area of consideration will be limited to
positions subject to the Developmental Team process, career broadener/intern
outplacements and placements to minimize adverse action. </p>

<p class="msonormal31">15.56.4. Once established priority requirements are
cleared, the vacancy is announced for competitive actions. The supervisor is
issued a candidate referral list of qualified candidate names. Once the
supervisor receives the candidate referral list, he or she may confer with the
human resource specialist for interview procedures. If an interview is used as
part of the selection process, the supervisor arranges the interview.
Interviews are required for all General Schedule-14 and General Schedule-15 positions.
Should the selecting official choose to interview, questions must be approved
by the civilian personnel sections prior to use. All candidates should be asked
the same questions, and the interview periods should be of relatively equal
length. Some interview requirements may be defined by a locally negotiated
agreement with the representative union. </p>

<p class="msonormal31">15.56.5. Centrally managed career programs cover
most vacancies in grades General Schedule-12 through General Schedule-15.
Senior functional managers set career development and placement policies for
employees in career program covered positions. These positions are subject to
the same recruitment processes as non-centrally managed positions. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.57. Training and Development. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal40">Air Force policy provides for necessary training to
improve skills needed in employee performance. Supervisors are responsible for
determining training requirements and working with the civilian personnel
sections or education and training function to identify appropriate training sources.
Organizational funds must often be used to support training needs; however,
civilian training funds are often available. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.57.1.<b class="calibre1"> Identifying Training Requirements: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal27">15.57.1.1. Conducted annually is a training-needs
survey which provides the supervisor an opportunity to project training
requirements for the upcoming fiscal year. Due to unforecasted mission
requirements, however; supervisors may request an out-of-cycle training need at
any time during the year. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">15.57.1.2. Although first-line supervisors are the
key individuals in determining development needs, they may need additional
guidance from higher-level management, other supervisors, or the employees
themselves. The servicing employee development specialist is available to
assist in training needs analysis and identification of methods and training
sources. </p>

<p class="msonormal27">15.57.1.3. Not all training and developmental needs
can or should be met through Air Force sponsorship. Employees are responsible
for independently pursuing training and education that will prepare them for
promotion or develop them for career transitions. Such self-development
activity is employee initiated and accomplished during off-duty hours.
Supervisors should encourage civilian employees to participate in
self-development activities, when appropriate. Civilian tuition assistance is
available in some major commands and field operating agencies. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.57.2.<b class="calibre1"> Training Sources: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal27">15.57.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Primary Training Sources.</b> Once
training needs are identified, the next step is to determine training sources.
The three primary sources of training are agency (Air Force), interagency, and
nongovernment. Training away from the work site is requested, approved, and
documented using Standard Form 182, <i class="calibre2">Authorization, Agreement and
Certification of Training. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal20">15.57.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Agency Training.</b> Agency training
is conducted by the employer (Air Force) and may include on-thejob training,
in-house training, and Air Force formal schools. On-the-job training and
in-house training are often the most effective because the supervisor tailors
the training to meet the specific job requirements. On-the-job training usually
is as casual as giving a few pointers to a new worker or as formal as a fully structured
training program with timetables and specified subjects. Therefore, on-the-job
training can include directing employees to appropriate publications for
self-study. Some functional activities also use in-house training. This type of
training is very effective when a large number of employees need instruction on
common aspects of occupational skill requirements.  </p>

<p class="msonormal20">15.57.2.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Air Force Formal Schools.</b> More
formalized agency classroom training is available through Air Force formal
schools listed in the Web-based <i class="calibre2">Education and Training Course Announcements
(ETCA)</i> located at <a href="https://etca.randolph.af.mil/" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">https://etca.randolph.af.mil/</span></a><a href="https://etca.randolph.af.mil/" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre5">.</span></a> Career field management programs plan for and sponsor
developmental assignments, tuition assistance, formal training, and education
to develop current and future managers. Leadership and management developmental
opportunities, including intermediate service school and senior service school,
are available to eligible high-potential civilian employees. Information is
available at<a href="http://www.afciviliancareers.com/apply/howtoapply/" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre5"> </span></a><a href="http://www.afciviliancareers.com/apply/howtoapply/" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">www.afciviliancareers.com</span></a><a href="http://www.afciviliancareers.com/apply/howtoapply/" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre5">.</span></a> </p>

<p class="msonormal18">15.57.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Interagency Training.</b> This
training may be needed if agency sources are not adequate to meet identified
training needs. Interagency training includes all training sponsored by other
United States government agencies. Office of Personnel Management, the United
States Departments of Army and Navy, and the United States Departments of Labor
and Agriculture are just a few sources from which to obtain training. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">15.57.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Nongovernmental Training.</b> Federal
regulations require agencies to consider and select government training sources
before turning to nongovernment alternatives. However, nongovernment sources
may be considered when agency or interagency courses cannot satisfy the
training need or when nongovernment training is more advantageous.
Nongovernment sources incorporate a wide range of seminars, conferences,
courses, and workshops, as well as curricula offered by private educational
institutions. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.58. Performance, Conduct, and Discipline:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal218">15.58.1. <b class="calibre1">Performance Planning, Appraisals, and Awards for
Employees.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal14">The employee is advised of the duties and
responsibilities of the job and the supervisor’s performance expectations in
their core personnel document. Employees receive annual appraisals on how well
they perform their duties. Supervisors may reward employees for performing
their duties well. A performance award is a management option to recognize high
performance. </p>

<p class="msonormal87">15.58.1.1. Supervisors set the performance elements
(duties and tasks) for the civilian employees they supervise. In developing an
employee’s performance elements, supervisors determine the major and important
requirements of the employee’s job based on the employee’s direct contribution
to organization or work unit objectives. </p>

<p class="msonormal27">15.58.1.2. Performance standards prescribe how a
particular element or duty must be accomplished. Set by supervisors, the
standards must reflect levels necessary for acceptable performance. When
possible, supervisors should identify observable behaviors that lead to success
on the job. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b><i class="calibre2"> </i>Elements and standards are documented in
writing on Air Force Form 860, <i class="calibre2">Civilian Performance Plan</i>, if a core
personnel document is not used. </p>

<p class="msonormal27">15.58.1.3. The performance appraisal is the basis
for personnel actions to identify and correct work performance problems,
recognize and reward quality performance, improve productivity, and grant
periodic pay increases. Supervisors review the employee’s performance of each
element and rate the performance against each element’s standards and then
render an overall summary rating. AFI 36-1001, <i class="calibre2">Managing the Civilian
Performance Program</i>, provides guidance for evaluating civilian employee
performance for General Schedule and Federal Wage System employees. </p>

<p class="msonormal90">15.58.1.4. Performance awards (performance cash
award, time-off award, and quality step increase) can be used as tools to
motivate General Schedule and Federal Wage System employees to perform above an
acceptable level as well as compensate them for performing beyond expectations.
Effective management of the performance awards program can help improve
productivity and morale in the organization. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">15.58.1.5. Poor performance must be corrected.
Employees who fail one or more performance elements are administered an
unacceptable appraisal and will have an opportunity to improve. Causes for poor
performance are identified (medical conditions, training deficiencies, etc.).
However, if performance does not improve to a satisfactory level, the employee
may be removed from the position. Placement in another position at the same or
lower grade is possible. Separation from civilian employment is also possible. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.58.2.<b class="calibre1"> Personal Conduct: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">15.58.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Standards of Conduct.</b> AFI 36-703,
<i class="calibre2">Civilian Conduct and Responsibility</i>, and the Department of Defense
5500.7-R, <i class="calibre2">Joint Ethics Regulation</i>, cover activities that are mandatory
for civilian employees and activities that are prohibited. Employees are
required to comply with standards of conduct in all official matters. Employees
are expected to maintain high standards of honesty, responsibility, and
accountability and to adhere to the Air Force core values of <i class="calibre2">Integrity
First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal87">15.58.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Required Activities. </b>Among
required activities are: furnishing testimony in official investigations and
hearings consistent with protections against self-incrimination; paying lawful
debts and taxes; being present for work unless authorized to be absent; complying
with health, safety, and all other proper instructions regarding work;
presenting a positive public image and complying with reasonable dress and
grooming standards; and maintaining professional relationships with fellow
workers, subordinates, and supervisors. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">15.58.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Prohibited Actions. </b>Prohibited
actions follow the guidance in federal laws and government-wide regulations, as
well as Department of Defense and Air Force instructions. Discrimination and
sexual harassment, drug and alcohol abuse, misuse of government purchase cards,
misuse of government computers, vehicles and other equipment, taking bribes,
conducting personal business at work, and criminal behavior off-duty that
reflect adversely on Air Force employment are among the prohibited activities.
The Air Force does not attempt to list all possible forms of improper conduct
but warns employees that misconduct will not be tolerated. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.58.3.<b class="calibre1"> Discipline: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal219">15.58.3.1. Disciplinary action is taken to correct
employee misconduct or performance when the employee can control the essentials
of the performance problems and has the skills, knowledge, and capacity to
perform well but is unwilling to do so. Guidance is in AFI 36-704, <i class="calibre2">Discipline
and Adverse Actions</i>.<i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal20">15.58.3.2. The Air Force goal in the area of
civilian discipline is to maintain a constructive work environment. If a
disciplinary or adverse action must be taken against a civilian employee, this
action must be done without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national
origin, age, disability, or other factors (such as marital status or politics).
Actions based on an employee’s inability to perform because of a physical or
mental disability should only be taken when the employee’s disability cannot be
reasonably accommodated. </p>

<p class="msonormal21">15.58.3.3. The employee must receive advance notice
of impending actions. Disciplinary or adverse actions must be prompt and
equitable and comply with the intent and letter of all governing requirements,
and respect must be given to the private nature of the actions. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">15.58.3.4. Proper administration of discipline is a
chief concern of labor organizations representing Air Force employees.
Procedures governing disciplinary and adverse actions are common features of
most Air Force labormanagement agreements. Moreover, a basic tenet of federal
labor relations law states that an employee who is a member of a bargaining
unit has a right to union representation, upon the employee’s request, during
an investigatory interview where the employee reasonably believes disciplinary
action may result from the interview. </p>

<p class="msonormal87">15.58.3.5. Oral admonishment, the least severe
disciplinary action, is often adequate to improve work habits or correct
behavior. For significant misconduct or repeated infractions, a written
reprimand may be an appropriate penalty. Written reprimands are recorded in the
employee personnel record for a specified period, as directed by AFI 36-704, or
an applicable negotiated labor-management contract. </p>

<p class="msonormal219">15.58.3.6. Suspension is a disciplinary action that
may be imposed for more serious infractions when the situation indicates that a
lesser penalty is not adequate. A suspension is a particularly severe
disciplinary action that places the employee in a nonpay and nonduty status,
usually for a specific length of time. Employees accused of serious crime may
be suspended indefinitely until criminal justice is complete. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">15.58.3.7. For employees who have received oral
admonishments, written reprimands, or suspensions and whose behavior continues
to be inappropriate, or for such a onetime egregious event of misconduct,
removal may occur. Like all other disciplinary actions, the supervisor must
ensure the disciplinary action is warranted and well documented. Reprimands,
suspensions, and removals must be coordinated with the civilian personnel
sections and the staff judge advocate so a procedural violation or an
administrative oversight does not jeopardize a valid disciplinary action. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.59. Working Conditions: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal8">15.59.1.<b class="calibre1"> Pay: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal27">15.59.1.1. Civilian employees are paid every 2
weeks. General Schedule employee pay is expressed as an annual salary and high
cost areas have higher pay rates. All General Schedule pay rates in the United
States include locality pay and pay rates overseas do not include locality pay
and are approximately 10 percent lower than United States rates. General
Schedule pay scales normally increase in January through the legislative
process. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">15.59.1.2. The Federal Wage System consists of wage
grade, wage leader, and wage supervisor. The Federal Wage System pay is
expressed as hourly wage rates. Federal Wage System rates vary more between
local areas than General Schedule. Federal Wage System rates may also be
increased annually but on an area-by-area basis throughout the year. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">15.59.1.3. Both General Schedule and Federal Wage
System have steps in each grade. Employees progress through the steps via
longevity. The General Schedule grades have 10 steps. Within grade or step
increases start at 1-year intervals, but slow to 3-year intervals in the higher
steps. Federal Wage System grades have five steps. Federal Wage System within
grade increases start at 6-month intervals and slow to 2-year intervals. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">15.59.1.4. Pay for overtime is at time-and-a-half
or 1.5 times base pay. Overtime pay for General Schedule employees is capped at
1.5 times the GS-10, step 1, pay rate; for employees with rates of basic pay
greater than the basic pay for General Schedule-10, step 1, the overtime hourly
rate is the greater of either the hourly rate of basic pay for General
Schedule-10, step 1, multiplied by 1.5, or the employee’s hourly rate of basic
pay. Instead of overtime pay, an employee may receive compensatory time off for
each hour of overtime worked. Work at night, on Sunday, and on a federal
holiday earns extra pay. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.59.2.<b class="calibre1"> Work Hours: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">15.59.2.1. Civilian work hours are more precisely defined
and less flexible than those of Regular Air Force military personnel. Civilian
work schedules are defined in such terms as administrative workweek, basic
workweek, regular tour of duty, uncommon tour of duty, and part-time tour of duty.
Most civilians work a regular tour of duty. Normally, this is five 8-hour days,
Monday through Friday. Uncommon tours of duty (a 40-hour basic workweek that
includes Saturday and/or Sunday or fewer than 5 days, but not more than 6 days
of a 7-day administrative workweek) are authorized when necessary for mission
accomplishment. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">15.59.2.2. Special circumstances permit part-time,
intermittent, or special tours of duty. Installation and tenant commanders
establish, by written order, daily work hours to include designated rest and
lunch periods. Two types of alternate work schedules can be implemented by
organization commanders. Flexible work schedules allow employees to start and
end work at different times. Compressed work schedules cover 80 hours in a pay
period in fewer than 10 workdays. The most common schedule has four 9-hour days
each week, an 8-hour day in 1 week, and a regular day off in the other week.
AFI 36-807, <i class="calibre2">Weekly and Daily Scheduling of Work and Holiday Observances, </i>covers
work scheduling. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">15.59.3.<b class="calibre1"> Absence and Leave: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">15.59.3.1. Civilian employees earn 13 days of sick
leave each year and 13, 20, or 26 days of annual leave, depending on their
length of service. Annual leave accumulation is capped at 30 days for most
General Schedule and Federal Wage System employees. Employees working overseas
can accumulate 45 days. There is no cap on sick leave accumulation. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">15.59.3.2. Annual leave is used for vacations
and/or personal reasons and should be approved in advance of being taken,
unless emergency conditions exist. Leave is charged and taken in 15-minute
increments. Sick leave for medical appointments or care for a family member
should be scheduled and approved in advance except in cases of emergency.
Illness or injury that keeps an employee away from work should be reported to a
supervisor during the first two hours of the duty day. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">15.59.3.3. Absence for jury duty, dismissals for
extreme weather conditions, or absences excused by the installation commander
are not charged to annual leave. Employees who have earned compensatory time
for overtime or timeoff awards should schedule absences to use that time like
they schedule annual leave. Absence and leave are covered in AFI 36-815, <i class="calibre2">Absence
and Leave. </i></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.60. Unions in the Air Force: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal30">15.60.1. Approximately 70 percent of Air Force
civilian employees are covered by labor agreements between unions and
installations or major commands. As such, they are members of the bargaining
unit, even if they are not dues-paying union members. Unions have legal status
under federal law. Guidance is included in AFI 36-701, <i class="calibre2">Labor Management
Relations.</i> </p>

<p class="msonormal31">15.60.2. A labor relations officer or specialist in
the civilian personnel sections is the usual liaison between supervisors and
other management officials and union officials. The job can be full-time or
part of a larger assignment. The labor relations officer speaks for management
in routine communications with the union and with parties outside the Air Force
who have roles in labor contract negotiations and dispute resolution. </p>

<p class="msonormal37">15.60.3. A variety of union officials may act for,
and make commitments for, unions. These include elected officers such as the
president, vice president, and treasurer; and appointed officials such as
stewards and union delegates to special meetings or projects. As part of a
democratic organization, the union official may be required to present issues
to a committee, such as a bargaining committee for approval. At other times,
the official may have been delegated authority to make commitments. One of the
duties of union officials is to raise employee concerns in the early stages of
policy formulation and to resolve employee complaints. Managers should strive
to work with union officials, particularly where grievances have been filed, in
a professional, nondefensive manner. </p>

<p class="msonormal220">15.60.4. Management and union representatives
negotiate collective bargaining agreements (contracts) covering grievance
procedures, use of official time for union matters, use of Air Force resources
by unions such as office space, telephone, and computers, and other local or
major command-wide items of interest impacting the working conditions of
bargaining unit employees. These contracts bind both sides with agreements
subject to interpretation by third parties outside Department of Defense and
Air Force; for example, the Federal Labor Relations Authority and/or
arbitrators. Contracts do not cover pay, benefits, or other matters governed by
Federal laws and government-wide regulations. However, revised Air Force
instructions that differ from provisions in a contract may need to be
negotiated. In recent years, civilian performance appraisal changes were not
implemented at some installations until conclusion of lengthy negotiations
between management and unions. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.61. Dispute Resolution: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal31">15.61.1. Civilian employees have a variety of
avenues to resolve disputes. Labor-management contracts must include a
negotiated grievance procedure that must be used by members of the bargaining
unit. Most start with an option to seek resolution using outside neutral facilitators
or mediators (alternative dispute resolution). Formal grievances follow two or
more steps before one side decides to refer the dispute to a paid, outside
arbitrator. Costs are usually shared equally by the union and management, so
union decisions to pursue arbitration are not routine. Subject to challenge on
points of law or contract terms, arbitrators’ decisions are final. </p>

<p class="msonormal37">15.61.2. Supervisors, managers, and employees who
are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, or who are not members of
the bargaining unit follow different grievance procedures. AFI 36-1203, <i class="calibre2">Administrative
Grievance System,</i> covers the administrative grievance process.
Administrative grievances are decided by Air Force officials, usually the
installation commander or designee, although outside fact finders may be used
at management’s option.  </p>

<p class="msonormal9">15.61.3. A number of personnel decisions, for
example, nonselection for promotion and performance recognition, are excluded
from administrative grievances and most negotiated grievance procedures.
Appeals of adverse actions covered by legal appeal rights are also excluded
from the administrative grievance system. The Merit System Protection Board
hears appeals of suspensions without pay of more than 14 days, demotions
(change to lower grade), and removals. Disputes pursued as grievances cannot be
duplicated as equal employment opportunity complaints and vice versa. Appeals
of adverse actions that include allegations of discrimination may be reviewed
by both Merit System Protection Board and the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission. </p>

<p class="msonormal31">15.61.4. A different route is taken to resolve
union/management disputes concerning the statutory rights of either party. The
Federal Labor Relations Authority investigates charges of unfair labor practice
brought by either union or management. The union files most unfair labor
practice charges when managers or supervisors are accused of changing working
conditions or calling formal meetings without proper notice to the union. If
found guilty, management may be required to revert back to the previous working
condition, and the organization commander, including a wing commander, can be
required to post an admission of managements wrong doing on official base
bulletin boards. </p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1">15.62. Conclusion: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal220">15.62.1. The Air Force mission requires military
members to be prepared for service at all times. Force support organizations
ensure Airmen’s families are cared for, pay and entitlements are properly
addressed, and their individual rights are secure. This chapter included
information on enlisted assignments, family care, reenlistment and retraining
opportunities, benefits and services, personnel records and individual rights,
the awards and decorations program, and the Airman Promotion system. </p>

<p class="msonormal161">15.62.2. This chapter continued with the Senior NCOs
Promotion Program, identifying how manpower requirements are quantified and how
supervisors initiate changes, and using competitive sourcing to maximize
cost-effectiveness, efficiency and enhance mission capability by taking
advantage of services available through the private commercial sector. This
chapter also introduced civilian personnel management, covering such areas as
job descriptions, filling positions, training, performance, conduct, and
discipline; and working conditions, equal employment opportunity working
conditions, and unions. Senior NCOs require a basic understanding of the
subject areas to effectively lead.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

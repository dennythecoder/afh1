<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre1">STUDYING EFFECTIVELY </b></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 24A—Overview </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">24.1. Introduction. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">Getting the most out of promotion studies is an individual
affair. No method will produce the best results for every Airman. Lack of
success may have more to do with poorly developed study skills than
intellectual ability. This chapter suggests methods for effective studying, but
each Airman must determine which methods and strategies work best for him or
her. This chapter covers effective study habits, study strategies, the military
knowledge and testing system, and a learning style self-assessment instrument
to help Airmen prepare for promotion exams. This information is not testable
for promotion. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">Section
24B—Effective Study Habits in Eight Easy Steps </span></i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3">24.2. General Information. </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal7">Airmen grapple with many issues that may make it difficult to
concentrate on studying. To get promoted, you must study for your Promotion
Fitness Exam or United States Air Force Supervisory Exam. The key to effective
studying is to study smartly. You can begin with these effective study habits. </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><span class="calibre3">24.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Approach Studying with the Right Mindset: </b></span></p>

<p class="msonormal9">24.2.1.1. Many people consider studying a necessary task,
rather than an enjoyable opportunity to learn, but research indicates that how
you approach a task is almost as important as the task itself. Having the right
mindset may help you study more effectively. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.2.1.2. Sometimes you can’t force yourself to have the
right mindset. During such times, you should take a study break. If you are
distracted by other issues, studying will be an exercise in futility. Come back
to it when you’re not focused on something else. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.2.1.3. How to improve your study mindset: </p>

<p class="msonormal11">24.2.1.3.1. Decide to think positively while you study;
remind yourself of your skills and abilities. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.2.1.3.2. Avoid catastrophic thinking. Instead of
thinking, “I’ll never have enough time to study for this exam,” think “It may
be a little late to start studying, but if I do it now, I can still get most of
it done.” </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.2.1.3.3. Avoid absolute thinking. Instead of thinking “I
always mess up,” the more objective view is, “I didn’t do very well last time.
What can I do to improve?” </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.2.1.3.4. Avoid comparing yourself negatively with
others. </p>

<p class="msonormal12"><span class="calibre3">24.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> Bring Everything You Need; Nothing You Don’t: </b></span></p>

<p class="msonormal13">24.2.2.1. When you find an ideal place to study, you may
bring things you don’t need. For example, it may seem ideal to type notes into
a computer to refer to later, but computers are a powerful distraction for many
people. So ask yourself if you really need a computer to take notes, or can you
make do with the old-fashioned paper and pencil. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.2.2.2. Don’t forget the things you need to study for
promotion (see the Enlisted Promotion Reference and Requirements catalog, <a href="https://www.omsq.af.mil/TE/EPRRC.pdf" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre5">https://www.omsq.af.mil/TE/EPRRC.pdf</span></a><a href="https://www.omsq.af.mil/TE/EPRRC.pdf" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">)</span></a> to ensure you are
studying the correct information. Don’t waste time running back and forth to
get an important book, paper, or other resource. </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><span class="calibre3">24.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Outline and Rewrite Your Notes. </b></span></p>

<p class="msonormal10">Many people find a standard outline format helps them boil
information down to its most basic components, and connecting similar concepts
makes information easier to remember during an exam. An outline is most
effective as a learning tool when you use your own words and structure because
everyone connects similar information differently. Failing to outline in your
own style and words may result in failure to remember important items. </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><span class="calibre3">24.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Use Memory Games (Mnemonic Devices): </b></span></p>

<p class="msonormal10">20.2.4.1. Memory games, such as mnemonic devices, use
simple word association to help remember pieces of information. Some people
string together words to form an easy-to-remember nonsense sentence. The first
letter of each word stands for a piece of the information you’re trying to
remember. A common military mnemonic device example is “Be My Little General of
the Air Force.” The first letters of the words help you remember the general
officer ranks: Brigadier, Major, Lieutenant, and General. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.2.4.2. The key to such memory devices is the new phrase
or sentence you come up with has to be more memorable and easier to remember
than the terms or information you’re trying to learn. These don’t work for
everyone, so if mnemonics don’t work for you, don’t use them. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">24.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Practice, Practice, Practice. </b>The age-old adage “practice makes
perfect” is true. You can practice by yourself using practice exams or flash
cards (depending on what’s available). If a practice exam isn’t available, you
can make one yourself. However, interactive exercises available at<a href="http://pdg.af.mil/" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6"> </span></a><a href="http://pdg.af.mil/" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre7">http://pdg.af.mil/</span></a><a href="http://pdg.af.mil/" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6"> </span></a>may
help you retain information from Air Force Handbook 1, <i class="calibre2">Airman</i>. Whatever tools you use, practice can enhance your retention
of general military knowledge in the Air Force Handbook 1, <i class="calibre2">Airman</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">24.2.6. <b class="calibre1">Make and Stick
to a Schedule:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">20.2.6.1. Many people plan to study when they get around to
it or have some spare time. If you schedule study time the same way your duty
hours are scheduled, you’ll find studying is less hassle in the long run.
Instead of last-minute cramming sessions, scheduling the same amount of study
time every day for 3 to 6 months before your promotion test will be easier and
enable you to learn more of the material. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">20.2.6.2. Some people study every day, others once or twice
a week. Frequency isn’t as important as actually studying routinely. Even if
you study one day a week for 6 to 8 months, that is better than a massive cram
session a few days before the exam. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">24.2.7. <b class="calibre1">Build in
Breaks and Rewards:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">20.2.7.1. If you view studying as a chore, it will be
natural to avoid it. If, however, you use rewards to help reinforce what you’re
doing, you may be pleasantly surprised by an attitude change. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">20.2.7.2. Start by breaking study time into manageable
components. Studying for 4 hours at a time without a break is unrealistic for
most people. Studying for an hour followed by a 5-minute break and a snack may
be more sustainable and enjoyable for you. Divide study time into segments that
make sense and work for you. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">20.2.7.3. When establishing your goals, establish rewards
as well. Tell yourself specifically what your reward will be if you reach your
goal: Maybe “I will have a special dessert tonight if...,” or “I will buy a new
song online if...,” or “I will spend an extra 30 minutes gaming if...” for
reaching the established goal. The point is, find a reward that is small but
real, and to stick to it. Setting limits on your behavior is a method to teach
yourself discipline. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">24.2.8. <b class="calibre1">Stay Healthy
and Balanced: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">20.2.8.1. It may seem hard to live a balanced life, but the
more balanced your life, the easier every component becomes. If you spend all
of your time focused on one thing, your life may become unbalanced. When that
happens, everything becomes more difficult. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">20.2.8.2. Maintaining a balanced life comes more easily
over time, but you can work to improve health and balance by doing what you
already know: exercise regularly, eat nutritious food, and get enough sleep.
There are no shortcuts to good health. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 24C—Study Strategies </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">24.3. General
Information. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">Whether you are studying for a promotion test, specialty
knowledge test, or any other test, the following study strategies may help you
attain your goals: </p>

<p class="msonormal15">24.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Stay
Motivated.<span class="calibre4">  </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">Studying and learning can take you far in life, yet it can
seem so hard to get around to it, and life’s constant distractions don’t help. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.1.1. <b class="calibre1">Attention.</b>
Distractions can affect your motivation to study. If you were totally isolated
on a desert island, where there was absolutely nothing to do but study, you’d
study every word of your subject until you were completely versed in it because
there would be nothing to distract you. Having so many choices means—now more
than ever—we need to exert willpower.<span class="calibre4">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.1.2. <b class="calibre1">What Do
You Want Out of Life?</b> To stay motivated, you should think about why you are
studying. Presumably, studying is connected to what you want out of life, so
ask yourself what you will ultimately get out of those things you do to avoid
studying. Your life will be what you make of it. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.1.3. <b class="calibre1">Feed and
Develop Your Mind. </b>We live in a world surrounded by entertainment options.
However, your mind needs the nutrition of study as well as the relaxation of
entertainment. When you study well, you find it has its own subtle pleasures
and satisfactions apart from the positive results it can bring into your life. </p>

<p class="msonormal15"><a href="https://eis.aetc.af.mil/hq/A6/CSS/Project%20Documents/AFPAM36-2241/References/MSU%20Learning%20Center.doc" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">24.3.2.</span></a><a href="https://eis.aetc.af.mil/hq/A6/CSS/Project%20Documents/AFPAM36-2241/References/MSU%20Learning%20Center.doc" class="calibre4"><b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre6"> </span></b></a><b class="calibre1">Use
Time Wisely. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">You might have all the time in the world, but if you don’t
use it wisely, it won’t help you to meet your goals. Procrastination is a
problem for many students. The following tips may help you deal with this
issue: </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Clear Your
Schedule. </b>Recognize that your obligations are as important as other
people’s needs. Set limits to prevent or minimize interruptions. Give full
concentration to your studies without feeling guilty for whatever you’re not
doing. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Get
Motivated.</b> Create a distraction-free work area, and commit to staying there
for until you meet the day’s study goal. If you get sidetracked, remind
yourself how studying will help you achieve your goals. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">24.3.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Prioritize.
</b>Answers to these questions may help you establish a priority list: What
must be done first? When is it due? What is worth more in terms of the score?
What is worth more in terms of personal, educational or career goals? </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Use a
Daily “To Do” List.</b> A “to do” list can help you reach your goals by helping
you prioritize your daily tasks. As you complete tasks, check them off your
list. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Break Your
Study into Chunks.</b> Estimate how much time you’ll need to complete a task,
and don’t try to do it all at one time. Break it down so that it’s achievable
without being overwhelming. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.2.6.<b class="calibre1"> It Doesn’t
Have to Be Perfect.</b> Some people are so afraid they won’t perform perfectly
that they don’t do anything at all. Make sure you understand your goals. Then
evaluate how important your study is and what level of performance is
acceptable to you. Then, just do it. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.2.7.<b class="calibre1"> When You
Really Hate It, Do It First.</b> Work on a task you really hate first, while
you have more energy. Reward yourself when you complete those items on your
daily list. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">24.3.3.<b class="calibre1"> Study
Environment.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Once you know when and for how long you will study, commit
to a time and place that meets your needs. Make that decision based on whether
the environment matches your learning style. See Section 20E of this chapter
for information to help you understand your dominant learning style. When
establishing a study environment, consider: </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Time of
Day.</b> If possible, schedule your most challenging courses and most intense
study sessions when you are most alert. Determine if you feel more alert and
productive during the morning, midday, or evening, and schedule accordingly. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.3.2.<b class="calibre1"> Posture
and Mobility.</b> Some people prefer to sit at a table or desk (formal
posture); others learn more easily sitting comfortably on a sofa or lying on
the floor (informal); others need to move around when they study. Some people
can sit and study for long periods of time (high persistence), while others
need frequent breaks (low persistence). Recognize your posture and mobility
needs when you to plan. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.3.3.<b class="calibre1"> Sound.</b>
Not everyone needs to study in a perfectly quiet environment; if you like sound
when you study, try to make it an environment where the kinds of sounds won’t
actually be distracters. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.3.4.<b class="calibre1"> Lighting.</b>
Reading ability can be affected by the amount and type of lighting in your
study area, and contrast between text and paper color. Be aware that light does
make a difference, and choose a study environment that best matches your
learning preferences. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.3.5. <b class="calibre1">Temperature.</b>
You may not be able to control the room temperature, but you should be aware of
your temperature preferences and dress accordingly. </p>

<p class="msonormal19"><span class="calibre4"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal19"><span class="calibre4"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal20"><span class="calibre4"> </span></p>

Goals:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.4.1. <b class="calibre1">Be a
Lifelong Learner.</b> Technological advances have occurred in exponential leaps
over the past century, and the only certainty in life is change. Education is
the key to preparing you for change. Your most valuable asset and skill is your
ability to learn and apply knowledge gained through education. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.4.2. <b class="calibre1">Setting
Goals. </b>Setting goals is a good way to accomplish a particularly difficult
task, such as developing study skills. Setting SMART goals will have you
studying like a pro in no time. SMART goals are: </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.4.2.1. <b class="calibre1">Specific.</b>
Once you identify what you want to work on, narrow that down to a single,
specific thing. Working out one problem at a time may make it easier to reach
your goal without spreading yourself too thin. “I want to be a better reader”
is broad, so a more specific goal would be “I want to improve my reading
speed.” Write your specific goal on a piece of paper. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.4.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Measurable.
</b>You won’t know if you met your goal if you cannot measure it in some way.
For instance, instead of “I want to improve my reading speed,” a measurable
goal would be “I want to improve my reading speed by 10 words per minute.” </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.4.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Action. </b>This
is where you decide how to achieve your goal. Write this part as an explanatory
activity. For example, your goal might now be “I want to improve my reading
speed by 10 words a minute. I will do this by skimming over words like ‘the’
and ‘an’.” </p>

<p class="msonormal10">24.3.4.2.4.<b class="calibre1">
Realistic. </b>Make sure your goals are achievable. “I will improve my reading
speed by memorizing every word in the dictionary” is unrealistic for most
people. Everyone has limits (time, resources, ability, etc.). Do not ignore
limits or you may set unrealistic goals. </p>

<p class="msonormal21">24.3.4.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Timeline.
</b>Set a suspense date, and make sure it is both specific and realistic for
you. “I will meet this goal sometime over the summer” is vague. “I will meet
this goal by the first day of <a href="http://www.howtodothings.com/education/a1837-how-to-set-goals-to-improve-study-skills.html" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">school</span></a><a href="http://www.howtodothings.com/education/a1837-how-to-set-goals-to-improve-study-skills.html" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6"> </span></a>next
fall,” is specific and realistic. Your timeline may be days, months or years,
but must be realistic for you and your lifestyle. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">24.5.2. A score that reads Visual = 33, Auditory = 24,
Tactile = 19, indicates that you are a visual learner, with an auditory
learning backup, and some tactile learning. Such people learn best by seeing
something. If vision is obscured, visual learners can still learn through
listening and tactile modes, but the major and best mode of learning
unavailable. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">24.5.3. A score that reads Auditory = 30, Visual = 27,
Tactile = 20 indicates that you are an auditory learner, with a visual backup,
and some tactile learning. Such people learn best by hearing or saying what
needs to be learned. Auditory learners can learn by seeing the information, but
their best retention occurs when they see the information and repeat it to
themselves, or when they hear the material being read aloud. They may also
learn very well using audio cassettes, compact disks, or digital media with
retention and depth of learning enhanced by visual and tactile input. </p>

<p class="msonormal56">24.5.4. A score that reads Tactile = 34, Visual = 27,
Auditory = 27 indicates that you are a tactile learner, with auditory and
visual backup learning modes. Such people learn best by doing. They may write
material they see or hear, take notes during lectures but rarely need to look
at them afterwards, or find it easier to recall information if they move around
or have something in their hands.<span class="calibre85"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">24.6.</b> <b class="calibre1">Auditory Learners.</b><span class="calibre4">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal17">Auditory learners use hearing to process information. When
given a choice, strong auditory learners will sit where they can easily hear
the speaker and where outside sounds will not interfere. Some auditory learners
will sit to one side, on the side of their strongest ear. Many auditory
learners find it easy to understand the words from songs on the radio and
announcements on public address systems. </p>

<p class="msonormal58">Tactile/kinesthetic learners need to touch and feel things.
They want to feel or experience the lesson themselves. Given a choice, strong
kinesthetic learners will be right in the middle of the action. They may take
things apart to see how they work and put them back together, without
directions. </p>

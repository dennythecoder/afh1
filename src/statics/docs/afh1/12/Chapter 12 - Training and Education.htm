<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1">TRAINING AND EDUCATION </b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section
12A—Overview </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">12.1. Introduction. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">A "job" does not guarantee success,
however, effective On the Job Training; Job Knowledge, Job Proficiency and Job
Experience will ultimately lead to a successful career and with continued
Education and Training, a solid national defense. On-the-job training (OJT) has
been around since the beginning of history and has been used in the United
States by both public and private industries for many years. Today, most
successful companies have effective OJT programs because OJT works.
Well-trained workers mean higher production, positive morale, greater profits,
and higher wages. Air Force training costs millions of dollars annually, for
good reason. To accomplish the mission, whether that means satellites in orbit,
planes in the air, reports to higher headquarters, or vehicles on the road,
training is a must. In addition to OJT, training management covers upgrade
training, skill levels, retraining, and training responsibilities, forms, and
documentation. Finally, each base education office provides Service members
with educational opportunities in which they may voluntarily participate during
off-duty time or other times, as authorized by military policies. The base
education office also provides information on financial assistance and
commissioning programs. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section
12B—Training Management </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">12.2. Education and Training Purpose.</b>  </p>

<p class="msonormal6">Skilled and trained personnel are critical to the
Air Force in providing a strong national defense capability. The Air Force OJT
program provides training for personnel to attain knowledge and skill
qualifications required to perform duties in their specialty.  </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">12.3. Strategy.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal7">Develop, manage, and execute realistic and flexible
training programs to produce a highly skilled, motivated force capable of
carrying out all tasks and functions in support of the Air Force mission. These
programs should provide the foundation for Air Force readiness.  </p>

<p class="msonormal8"><b class="calibre3">12.4.
Training and Mission Accomplishment.</b>  Training is an integral part of the
unit’s mission. An effective training program requires commander and
supervisory involvement at all levels.  </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">12.5. Training and Airman Career Program.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal">Supervisors must take an active role in the trainee’s
career progression and<b class="calibre1"> </b>explain<b class="calibre1"> </b>the relationship between training
and career progression. While the supervisor’s primary responsibility is to
plan a program that outlines specific short-term, mission-related goals for the
trainee, overall success depends on the supervisor’s ability to advise and
assist Airmen in reaching their long-range career objectives. <b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">12.6. Training Components.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal9">The Air Force OJT program consists of three components: </p>

<p class="msonormal10">12.6.1. <b class="calibre1">Job Knowledge</b>—satisfied through career
development courses (CDC) designed to provide career knowledge, general task,
and deployment/unit type code task knowledge applicable to the Air Force
specialty code that is gained through a planned program of study involving CDCs
or technical references listed in the applicable career field education and
training plan (CFETP) across a wide spectrum of subjects pertaining to a career
field. When CDCs are not available, trainees study the applicable technical
references identified by the supervisor and/or CFETP. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">12.6.2. <b class="calibre1">Job Proficiency</b>—hands-on training provided
on the job, allowing the trainee to gain proficiency in tasks performed in the
work center. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">12.6.3. <b class="calibre1">Job Experience</b>—gained during and after
upgrade training to build confidence and competence. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">12.7. Upgrade Training.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">Upgrade training is the key to the total training program.
It leads to award of the higher skill level and is designed to increase skills
and abilities. Air Force specialty code upgrade training requirements for award
of 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels are outlined in Chapter 4 of AFI 36-2201, <i class="calibre2">Air
Force Training Program</i>, AFI 36-2101, <i class="calibre2">Classifying Military Personnel
(Officer and Enlisted), </i>and the applicable CFETP.  </p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.7.1.<b class="calibre1"> Apprentice.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">Airmen must<b class="calibre1"> </b>complete an initial skills course
for award of the 3-skill level. Retraining into an Air Force specialty code may
be accomplished via OJT alone only when specified in the retraining
instructions and as approved by the Air Force Career Field Manager or the Air
Reserve Component career field functional manager. Personnel retraining via OJT
may be awarded a 3-skill level when they complete knowledge training on all
tasks taught in the initial skills course and other tasks and mandatory
requirements identified by the Air Force Career Field Manager.<i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.7.2.<b class="calibre1"> Journeyman.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal13">Airmen must complete mandatory CDCs if available and
applicable mandatory core tasks identified in the CFETP. Award of the 5-skill
level also requires completion of a minimum of 12 months in upgrade training
and mandatory requirements listed in the Air Force Enlisted Classification
Directory. Additionally, the member must be recommended by the supervisor and
approved by the commander. Individuals in retraining status, training status
code (Training Status Code F), are subject to the same training requirements. <b class="calibre1">Exception:</b>
The member must complete a minimum of 9 months in upgrade training. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.7.3.<b class="calibre1"> Craftsman.</b>  </p>

<p class="msonormal14">To be a craftsman, the member must be at least a staff
sergeant; complete mandatory CDCs, if available; and complete applicable
mandatory core tasks identified in the CFETP. Award of the 7-skill level also
requires completion of: a 7-skill level craftsman course (if Air Force
specialty code requires it); mandatory requirements listed in the Air Force
Enlisted Classification Directory; and a minimum of 12 months in training.
Additionally, the member must be recommended by the supervisor and approved by
the commander. Individuals in retraining status (Training Status Code G) are
subject to the same training requirements. <b class="calibre1">Exception:</b> The member must
complete a minimum of 6 months in upgrade training.  </p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.7.4. <b class="calibre1">Superintendent.</b>  </p>

<p class="msonormal12">For award of the 9-skill level, the member must be
at least a senior master sergeant and meet mandatory requirements listed in the
Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory, be recommended by the supervisor,
and be approved by the commander. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">12.8. Retraining Program. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal15">The retraining program is designed to
balance the number of personnel in specific grades and year groups of the Air
Force specialty. Once retraining is approved and the Airman has been assigned
duty in the new specialty, upgrade training begins. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">With minor exceptions, training requirements are identical
for retrainees and standard upgrade trainees.  </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">12.9. Training Responsibilities: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">12.9.1.<b class="calibre1"> Unit Training Manager
(UTM).</b>  The UTM is the commander’s key staff member responsible for overall
management of the training program. UTMs serve as training consultants to all
unit members and determine if quality training programs are in effect within
all sections. UTMs:  </p>

<p class="msonormal12">12.9.1.1. Develop, manage, and conduct training in
support of in-garrison and expeditionary mission requirements; advise and
assist commanders and unit personnel in executing their training
responsibilities; and conduct a staff assistance visit of the unit’s training
program every 18 months. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">12.9.1.2. Interview newly assigned personnel within 30 days
(60 days for Air Reserve Component) to determine training status and CDC
enrollment/progression requirements. Initiate Air Force Form 623, <i class="calibre2">Individual</i>
<i class="calibre2">Training Record,</i> six-part folders (when required by the Air Force Career
Field Manager), or approved electronic equivalent, for all trainees entering
upgrade training for the first time and provide to the supervisor. Conduct a
comprehensive trainee orientation according to AFI 36-2201 for trainees
initially entering upgrade training within 60 days of assignment (90 days for
Air Reserve Component). UTMs must also manage the unit CDC program and conduct
a training progress review with the supervisor and trainee at the 24th month of
upgrade training to evaluate status.  </p>

<p class="msonormal18">12.9.1.3. Ensure all work centers have a master training
plan. Assist work centers in developing a master training plan to plan, manage,
and execute training activities. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.9.2.<b class="calibre1"> Supervisor.</b>  </p>

<p class="msonormal19">Supervisors have the single greatest impact on
mission accomplishment. They must share their experiences and expertise to meet
mission requirements and provide a quality training program to the trainee.
Supervisors must plan, conduct, and evaluate training. Supervisors will: </p>

<p class="msonormal20">12.9.2.1. Use CFETPs (or approved electronic
equivalent) to manage work center and individual training and develop master
training plans to ensure completion of all work center duty position
requirements (for example, 100 percent task coverage). The supervisor must also
integrate training with day-to-day work center operations and consider trainer
and equipment availability, training opportunities, and schedules. </p>

<p class="msonormal21">12.9.2.2. Conduct and document work center training
orientation within 60 days of new assignment (120 days for Air Reserve
Component). Also, conduct and document an initial evaluation of newly assigned
personnel’s trainee qualifications within 60 days of initial permanent change
of station or permanent change of assignment (120 days for Air Reserve
Component).   </p>

<p class="msonormal18">12.9.2.3. Select trainers (and certifiers as required by
the Air Force Career Field Manager) based on skill qualifications with the
assistance of the UTM.  </p>

<p class="msonormal18">12.9.2.4. Administer the CDC program for assigned trainees.
</p>

<p class="msonormal17">12.9.2.5.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Maintain Air Force Form 623, six-part
folder, or other approved training record for Airmen in the grades of airman
basic through technical sergeant (or personnel in combat ready duty positions,
if required by the Air Force Career Field Manager) and senior noncommissioned
officers in retraining status, or as directed by the Air Force Career Field
Manager. Before submitting members for upgrade, ensure the trainee, as a
minimum, meets all mandatory requirements as defined in the Air Force Enlisted
Classification Directory, CFETP, and the Air Force job qualification standard
(AFJQS).  </p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.9.3.<b class="calibre1"> Trainer.</b>  </p>

<p class="msonormal22">The trainer and supervisor may be the same individual. If
necessary, the supervisor may assign someone else to provide the training.
Trainers are selected based on their experience and ability to provide
instruction to the trainees. Additionally, they must maintain task
qualification and complete the Air Force Training Course. Trainer
responsibilities include planning, conducting, and documenting training;
preparing and using teaching outlines or task breakdowns, as necessary;
developing evaluation tools; and briefing the trainee and supervisor on the
training evaluation results.  </p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.9.4.<b class="calibre1"> Task Certifier.</b>  </p>

<p class="msonormal12">Task certifiers provide third-party certification
and evaluation on tasks identified by the Air Force Career Field Manager, if
applicable. The certifier must conduct additional evaluations and certify
qualification on those designated tasks. Certifiers must be at least a staff
sergeant with a 5-skill level or civilian equivalent, attend the Air Force
Training Course, and be capable of evaluating the task being certified.
Certifiers will develop evaluation tools or use established training evaluation
tools and methods to determine the trainee’s ability and training program
effectiveness and will brief the trainee, supervisor, and trainer on the
training evaluation results.  </p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.9.5.<b class="calibre1"> Trainee.</b>  </p>

<p class="msonormal23">The trainee is the focal point of the Air Force training
program. Trainees must make every effort to become qualified to perform in
their Air Force specialty. The success and quality of trainee training greatly
depends on the relationship between the supervisor, trainer, and trainee.
Trainees must: </p>

<p class="msonormal18">12.9.5.1.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Actively participate in all opportunities
for upgrade and qualification training. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">12.9.5.2. Comprehend the applicable CFETP requirements and
career path. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">12.9.5.3. Obtain and maintain knowledge, qualifications,
and appropriate skill level within the assigned specialty.  </p>

<p class="msonormal18">12.9.5.4. Budget on- and off-duty time to complete assigned
training tasks, particularly CDC and self-study training requirements, within
established time limits. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">12.9.5.5. Request assistance from the supervisor, trainer,
and UTM when having difficulty with any part of training. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">12.9.5.6. Acknowledge and document task qualification upon
completion of training. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">12.10. Training Forms and Documents.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal7">Training documentation is important to personnel at
all levels because it validates the status of training and task qualification.
Documentation also helps management assess mission capability and readiness,
and it defines requirements for individual career progression.  </p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.10.1.<b class="calibre1"> Air Force Form 623.</b>  </p>

<p class="msonormal18">The Air Force Form 623 (or electronic equivalent) is the
standard folder used as a training record. The form reflects past and current
qualifications and is used to determine training requirements. Supervisors
maintain the Air Force Form 623 for all assigned personnel according to AFI
36-2201.<i class="calibre2"> </i>The form is available to all personnel in the chain of command,
including the UTM, upon request. Return the form to the member upon separation,
retirement, commissioning, or promotion to master sergeant, unless otherwise
directed by the Air Force Career Field Manager. <b class="calibre1">Exception:</b> Do not give
Air Force Forms 623 containing classified information to the individual. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.10.2.<b class="calibre1"> Career Field Education and Training Program
(CFETP).</b>  </p>

<p class="msonormal14">The CFETP is a comprehensive core document identifying
life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources,
core and home station training, and deployment/Unit Type Code task requirements
for a specialty. Supervisors use the CFETP to plan, prioritize, manage, and
execute training within the career field. CFETPs are used to identify and
certify all past and current qualifications. Keep at least one copy of the
entire CFETP (Part I and II), in the work center for general access and master
training plan development. Unless otherwise directed by the Air Force Career
Field Manager, work center supervisors may file only Part II of the CFETP, with
cover page and identification page, in the Air Force Form 623, or equivalent
form. If the CFETP is divided into distinct sections (by aircraft, duty
position, or mission, etc.) then file only the sections applicable to the
individual, such as current/past qualifications, and current upgrade/duty
position training requirements. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">12.10.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Part I.</b> Provides information necessary for
overall management of the specialty and is maintained as part of the work
center master training plan. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">12.10.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> Part II.</b> Contains the specialty
training standard identifying the duties, tasks, and technical references to
support training, AETC-conducted training, core and home station training
tasks, deployment/Unit Type Code tasks, and correspondence course requirements.
</p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.10.3. <b class="calibre1">Air Force Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS).</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal18">The AFJQS is a training document approved by the Air Force
Career Field Manager for a particular job type or duty position within an Air
Force specialty. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">12.10.4. <b class="calibre1">Air Force
IMT 623A, <i class="calibre2">On-the-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet</i>.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal18">Use Air Force IMT 623A, or automated version, to document
an individual’s training progress. The form reflects status, counseling, and
breaks in training. The supervisor and/or trainer and the trainee must sign and
date all entries. </p>

<p class="msonormal25">12.10.5. <b class="calibre1">Air Force
IMT 797, <i class="calibre2">Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS</i>.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal18">Air Force IMT 797 is a continuation of the CFETP, Part II,
or AFJQS. This form defines locally assigned duty position, home station
training, and deployment/Unit Type Code requirements not included in the CFETP,
Part II. </p>

<p class="msonormal25">12.10.6. <b class="calibre1">Air Force
IMT 803, <i class="calibre2">Report of Task Evaluations</i>.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal14">Evaluators use Air Force IMT 803 to conduct and document
completion of task evaluations during training staff assistance visits, when
directed by the commander, or when task certification requires validation. File
completed evaluations conducted on a single trainee by the supervisor/trainer
or task certifier in Air Force Form 623 until upgraded or no longer applicable
to the current duty position. </p>

<p class="msonormal25">12.10.7. <b class="calibre1">Air Force
IMT 1098, <i class="calibre2">Special Task Certification and Recurring Training.</i></b> </p>

<p class="msonormal23">Supervisors use Air Force IMT 1098 to document selected
tasks requiring recurring training or evaluation. Air Force and major command
directives may identify tasks contained in the CFETP that require special
certification, recurring training, or evaluation. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.10.8.<b class="calibre1"> Master Training Plan.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal26">The master training plan employs a strategy for ensuring
all work center job requirements are completed by using a master task listing.
The master training plan provides milestones for tasks and CDC completion, and
prioritizes deployment/Unit Type Code, home station training, upgrade, and
qualification tasks. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">12.11. Career Development Course Program Management: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.11.1.<b class="calibre1"> Purpose and Scope:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal12">12.11.1.1. CDCs are published to provide the
information necessary to satisfy the career knowledge component of OJT. These
courses are developed from references identified in the CFETP that correlate
with mandatory knowledge items listed in the Air Force Enlisted Classification
Directory. CDCs must contain information on basic principles, techniques, and
procedures common to an Air Force specialty code. They do not contain
information on specific equipment or tasks unless the specific equipment or
task best illustrates a procedure or technique having utility to the entire Air
Force specialty code. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">12.11.1.2. Headquarters Air University/A4L
electronically publishes an “Air Force specialty code listing of CDC
requirements, identifying all mandatory CDCs for skill-level upgrade.” The list
is available on the Headquarters Air University/A4L website at <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/afiadl/" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre5">http://www.au.af.mil/au/afiadl/</span></a><a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/afiadl/" class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6"> </span></a>under the Course and Admin Information tab. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.11.2.<b class="calibre1"> CDC Administration:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal18">12.11.2.1. If available, supervisors will use CDCs to
satisfy career knowledge requirements for upgrade training. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">12.11.2.2. If a CDC becomes available after entering
upgrade training, the individual does not have to take the CDC, unless
specified by the Air Force Career Field Manager. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">12.11.2.3. The UTM will ensure trainees are enrolled in
required CDC material within 45 days of in-processing (within 60 days for
overseas units). </p>

<p class="msonormal27">12.11.2.4. Within 10 duty days of receipt, the UTM
issues CDC material to the supervisor and trainee and briefs them on proper use
of the CDC and documents the trainee’s Air Force IMT 623A or equivalent
automated training record. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">12.11.2.5. The supervisor determines volume sequence of
study, sets the overall course completion schedule, and develops a tracking
system to monitor progress. Each volume must be completed within 30 days. (<b class="calibre1">Exception:</b>
The UTM may grant an extension due to mission requirements. Air Reserve
Component and individual mobilization augmentees have 60 days.) If necessary,
the supervisor determines the reason for slow progress, counsels the trainee,
documents the counseling on Air Force IMT 623A or automated version, and places
the trainee in supervised study.  </p>

<p class="msonormal17">12.11.2.6. The trainee answers the unit review exercise
questions. The unit review exercise is an “open book” teaching device. The
trainee transfers answers to the field scoring sheet. The supervisor scores the
unit review exercise, conducts review training on the areas missed, fills in
the bottom of the scoring sheet, places the field scoring sheet in the Air
Force Form 623 or automated training records, counsels the trainee, and
documents Air Force IMT 623A or automated version. The supervisor will conduct
a comprehensive review of the entire CDC with the trainee in preparation for
the course examination and documents the review on the Air Force IMT 623A or
automated version. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">12.11.2.7. The supervisor will notify the UTM to schedule
and order the course examination.   </p>

<p class="msonormal20">12.11.2.8. If the trainee receives a satisfactory
result, the supervisor conducts and documents review training, then signs and
places the course examination scorecard in the Air Force Form 623 or automated
training records until the trainee completes upgrade training or qualification
training. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">12.11.2.9. If the trainee receives an unsatisfactory
result, the unit commander, with help from the UTM or base training manager,
interviews the supervisor and trainee to determine reason for failure and corrective
action required within 30 days from initial notification (90 days for Air
Reserve Component and individual mobilization augmentees). The supervisor
documents the counseling on Air Force IMT 623A or automated version, places the
trainee in supervised review training, and forwards a copy of the evaluation to
the base training office. </p>

<p class="msonormal28">12.11.2.10. If the trainee receives a second
unsatisfactory course examination result, the unit commander, with assistance
from the UTM or base training manager, interviews the supervisor and trainee to
determine reason for failure within 30 days from initial notification (90 days
for Air Reserve Component and individual mobilization augmentees). After
reviewing the facts, the unit commander decides on one of the following
options: (1) Evaluate for possible CDC waiver (do not place trainee into
Training Status Code T); (2) Withdraw the Airman for failing to progress, place
into Training Status Code T, and pursue separation; (3) Withdraw the Airman for
failing to progress, place into Training Status Code T, request Air Force
specialty code withdrawal, and recommend retraining or return to a previously
awarded Air Force specialty code; or (4) Withdraw Airman for failing to
progress, place into Training Status Code T, reevaluate at 90 days, and pursue
either option 1, 2, or 3 as appropriate.  </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section
12C—Community College of the Air Force</i> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">12.12. Community College of the Air Force:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal29">12.12.1. The Community College of the Air Force is the
largest community college in the world and is the only community college in the
Department of Defense exclusively for enlisted personnel. The mission of the
Community College of the Air Force is to offer and award job-related associate
in applied science degrees and other academic credentials that enhance mission
readiness, contribute to recruiting, assist in retention and support the career
transitions of Air Force enlisted members. Community College of the Air Force
awards the associate in applied science degree to enlisted members of the
Regular Air Force, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve Command. Community
College of the Air Force offers over 70 degree programs in 5 general areas: (1)
Aircraft and Missile Maintenance; (2) Allied Health; (3) Electronics and
Telecommunications; (4) Logistics and Resources; and (5) Public and Support
Services. Enlisted Airmen may only participate in degree programs specifically
designed for their Air Force occupational specialty. Community College of the
Air Force also offers programs and other academic credentials that support
professional development, professional certification, and recognition
opportunities. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">12.12.2. The Community College of the Air Force was
activated in 1972 to gain academic recognition for formal technical training
conducted by Air Force schools. From 1980 to 2004, Community College of the Air
Force was independently accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and
Schools Commission on Colleges. Today, Community College of the Air Force
shares in Air University’s regional accreditation through the Southern
Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.   </p>

<p class="msonormal31">12.12.3. The Community College of the Air Force
administrative center is located at Maxwell Air Force Base, Gunter Annex,
Alabama. More than 6,500 instructors assigned to more than 100 affiliated
schools deliver more than 2,000 degreeapplicable courses for which collegiate
credit is earned. Each year more than 1.6 million semester hours are earned in
Community College of the Air Force classrooms. To date, Community College of
the Air Force has awarded more than 480,000 associate of applied science
degrees.  </p>

<p class="msonormal">12.12.4. A<b class="calibre1">ssociate in Applied Science Degree.</b>
Associate degrees earned in professional, technical or terminal programs are
frequently called associate of applied science degrees. The educational
standard for the associate in applied science degree is to be designed for
those students who plan to seek employment based upon the competencies and
skills attained through these programs and to offer the academic, technical and
professional knowledge and skills required for job acquisition, retention and
advancement. While not designed to meet the needs of students who transfer to a
four-year institution, portions of these programs may do so. Community College
of the Air Force offers and awards the associate in applied science degree
designed to provide graduates with knowledge, skills and theoretical background
for enhanced performance as technicians within their respective Air Force
occupational specialty. This is accomplished by combining collegiate credit
earned through completed formal technical training courses delivered at
affiliated military schools and general education courses completed from
accredited civilian colleges. Since enlisted Airmen are constantly relocating
in performance of their duties, Community College of the Air Force provides a
means for them to complete degree requirements regardless of where they are assigned.
One way the Community College of the Air Force helps enlisted Airmen to
progress toward completing degree requirements while deployed, on temporary
duty, or at multiple duty locations is through General Education Mobile.
General Education Mobile identifies civilian colleges that provide distance
learning courses approved by the Community College of the Air Force in meeting
degree program general education requirements. This prevents Airmen from
completing unnecessary courses that would not apply toward degree graduation
requirements, eliminates waste of military tuition assistance funds, and
prevents wasting Airmen’s time and efforts.     </p>

<p class="msonormal5">12.12.5. Enlisted Airmen are automatically
registered in the Community College of the Air Force degree program designed
for their Air Force occupational specialty during the fourth week of Basic
Military Training. Each degree program consists of 64 semester hours and
combines Air Force formal technical training and education with a core of

<p class="msonormal11">12.13.1. <b class="calibre1">Professional Development. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal22">Credentialing is a critical element of enlisted
professional development. During the certification process, enlisted Airmen
gain advanced levels of knowledge and skills beyond their job qualification
training. Blending Air Force technical training and education with
industry-based skill sets and professional certification processes benefits the
Air Force by molding a more diverse and qualified workforce to maintain
critical and valuable national defense assets. The Airman benefits by being
provided the education and credentials needed in highly technical Air Force
career fields. The Airman will also possess highly valued skills needed by
industry when he or she transitions out of the Air Force. The end result is
industry benefits immensely by receiving a highly trained, qualified,
experienced, and disciplined employee, which is a valuable payback of
investments. To support documentary evidence of training, skills, and practical
experience, Airmen are highly encouraged to maintain records of all previous
and current education, training, and qualifications. </p>

<p class="msonormal">The Voluntary Education Program supports long-range Air
Force goals for maintaining a high-quality force and enhancing professional and
personal development, recruitment, retention, and readiness. The Air Force
offers three programs for enlisted personnel to help defray the cost of
obtaining off-duty education: </p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.15.1.<b class="calibre1"> Military Tuition Assistance.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal27">To assist individuals in furthering their education,
the Air Force provides a tuition assistance program (with some restrictions) to
all eligible Air Force members. As of 1 October 2014, the Air Force pays the
cost of tuition only at accredited institutions not to exceed the hourly and
annual caps established by DoDI 1322.25, <i class="calibre2">Voluntary Education</i> <i class="calibre2">Programs,</i>
and AFI 36-2649, <i class="calibre2">Voluntary Education</i> <i class="calibre2">Program.</i> These funds are not
taxed thus lowering the tax deduction in an Airman’s paycheck. Air Force
members cannot use tuition assistance to purchase textbooks, ebooks, career
development courses/DVDs, references/instructional materials, electronic
equipment/supplies, certificate/license examinations and all fees regardless of
applicability to course enrollment or institutional reimbursement policy.
Students using military tuition assistance whose tuition exceeds the semester
hour cap may use the top-up benefit in their Montgomery GI Bill or Post 9/11 GI
Bill to cover the remaining portion. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.15.2.<b class="calibre1"> Montgomery GI Bill.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal14">Eligible individuals who entered the service for the first
time on or after 1 July 1985 are enrolled in the Montgomery GI Bill. Members
who participate have their pay reduced by $100 a month for the first 12 months.
What looks like a contribution of $1,200 is actually a little more than $900
because no taxes are paid on the $1,200. Participants may also elect to
contribute an additional $600, which adds a maximum of $5,400 to the total
benefit package. Inservice use of the Montgomery GI Bill is permitted after 2
years of continuous Regular Air Force. Benefits expire 10 years after
separation or retirement. <b class="calibre1">Note: </b>The amount of the total benefit is
adjusted each year in relation to the cost of living index.  </p>

<p class="msonormal51"> </p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.15.3.<b class="calibre1"> Post-9-11 GI Bill.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal12">Eligible individuals who were on Regular Air Force
on or after 11 September 2001 may choose to enroll in this new GI Bill. This
program allows some Airmen to transfer GI Bill benefits to dependents if they
have sufficient retainability. The details and benefits of this GI Bill are not
the same as the Montgomery GI Bill. The decision to move to this program is
irrevocable, so Airmen are requested to get full details from the Veteran’s

course of the same or similar title. Some of the DANTES subject standardized
tests include law enforcement, business, natural science, social science and
history, and mathematics. </p>

<p class="msonormal53">12.16.2.<b class="calibre1"> The College-Level Examination Program (CLEP).</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal54">The CLEP measures college-level competency. The “general”

<p class="msonormal11">12.19.2.<b class="calibre1"> Leaders Encouraging Airmen Development (LEAD).</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal22">The LEAD Program delegates authority to unit and wing
commanders to nominate highly qualified Airmen to become Air Force officers via
United States Air Force Academy attendance. Depending on level of
qualifications, nominations may lead to direct entry to United States Air Force
Academy, entry to the United States Air Force Academy Preparatory School, or
referral to other programs.  </p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.19.3.<b class="calibre1"> Scholarships for Outstanding Airmen to Reserve
Officer Training Corps (SOAR) Program.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal13">SOAR offers Regular Air Force enlisted personnel the
opportunity to earn a commission while completing their bachelor’s degree as an
Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps cadet. Those selected separate from
the Regular Air Force Air Force and join an Air Force Reserve Officer Training
Corps detachment to become full-time college students. The Air Force provides
them with a tuition and fees scholarship of up to $15,000 per year, an annual
textbook allowance, and a monthly nontaxable stipend. Award of this scholarship
is for 2 to 4 years, depending on how many years remain in the student’s bachelor’s
degree program. Airmen with some or no college credit may apply for the
program. A limited number of SOAR selects are offered a scholarship with no
tuition cap. This program is open to students in any major. Upon graduation and
completion of the program, students are commissioned as second lieutenant and
returned to Regular Air Force (typically within 60 days of commissioning) for
at least 4 years. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">12.19.4.<b class="calibre1"> Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps Airman
Scholarship and Commissioning Program. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal27">This program allows military members to receive an
Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps scholarship to attend a college or
university of their choice, provided the college or university offers an Air
Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program. If selected for this program, the
member is discharged from Regular Air Force and enlisted into the Air Force
Inactive Obligated Reserve. Upon completion of the degree and the Air Force
Reserve Officer Training Corps requirements, the member receives an Air Force

Cooperative Program (AU-ABC). </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">12.20.1.<b class="calibre1"> Vision. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal27">The vision of Air Force leaders is to provide
distance learning and bachelor’s degree opportunities for Airmen. The AU-ABC
aligns with this Air Force vision and meets the Air University near-term goal
of providing enhanced educational opportunities for our enlisted force. The
AU-ABC initiative establishes partnerships between the Air Force and accredited
civilian higher education institutions to offer baccalaureate degree
opportunities via distance learning. AU-ABC links Airmen who have completed
associate degrees to “military supportive” baccalaureate programs. AU-ABC
applies Community College of the Air Force associate degree credit toward
baccalaureate degrees and requires participants to complete no more than 60
semester hours after having earned an Associate of Applied Science degree.
AU-ABC degree programs are linked to one or more Air Force-relevant degree
programs currently offered by Community College of the Air Force. To
participate, registrants must be serving in the Regular Air Force, Air Force
Reserves, or Air National Guard. Baccalaureate degree requirements may be
completed after a student retires or separates from the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal58">12.20.2.<b class="calibre1"> Program Plans. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">AU-ABC programs are classified in the three following

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section
13A—Overview </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.1. Introduction. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4">With the constant focus on efficiency, the Air Force must
get the greatest return from every investment. People are one of the most
important resources. This chapter provides valuable information to consider
when managing resources and personnel. Also, everyone must safeguard Air Force
property and protect it from fraud, waste, and abuse; and resource management
requires all members be sensitive to environmental issues. This chapter
provides an overview of resource management and identifies many of the Air Force
environmental programs. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section
13B—Traits of a Healthy Team </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.2. Introduction.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">As leaders, we must develop effective teams to accomplish
the mission. While building effective teams, we must cultivate a healthy team
spirit. The spirit in which a team operates influences every stage of team
development and can ultimately determine whether mission goals are met. A
healthy team spirit is the engine that runs high performance teams. Five
critical attributes are present in all healthy teams: trust, ethical behavior,
critical judgment, sharing, and cooperation. While each is essential in
building a healthy team spirit, trust is the core of all healthy team
interaction. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.3.</b> <b class="calibre1">Trust: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">13.3.1. Trust is essential in forming any good
relationship; teamwork requires good relationships with a high degree of trust.
Team members must share mutual confidence in the integrity and ability of
teammates. They also need to feel comfortable enough to take risks, think
outside the box, and share their thoughts and ideas without fear of being shut
down or discounted. Freedom to communicate openly, honestly, and directly
within the group is the hallmark of a trust-based team. Individuals must
understand the importance of utilizing effective communication skills to
develop the level of trust needed for the teams to grow. These communication
skills include positive listening habits such as maintaining good eye contact,
recalling essential information, allowing individuals to speak freely with
minimal to no interruptions, as well as responding in the appropriate manner.
In her book <i class="calibre2">"Teams at Work,"</i> author, organizational
consultant, and Institute for Planning and Development founder Dr. Suzanne
Zoglio wrote “Nothing reduces trust in a group faster than members saying one
thing within the group and something else outside the group. When members are
assertive enough to say what they need to say directly to the appropriate
people and to refrain from talking behind each other’s backs, trust is
enhanced.” </p>

<p class="msonormal6">13.3.2. Team members may respond to other team members they
do not trust by alienating them, ignoring their inputs, and withholding vital
information. Trust is important in creating a healthy team because information
needs to be shared and accepted in good faith. Feedback must also be exchanged
between members in an open and sincere manner without fear of harsh criticism.
Without trust, a team’s efforts can be sabotaged and progress brought to a
grinding halt. Leaders can promote a trusting atmosphere by being trustworthy
and by trusting their workers. Additionally, by valuing individual differences
and encouraging open and honest communication, leaders empower their teams to
solve problems innovatively through a shared sense of collaboration that is
free of self-preservation and one’s own personal interest.  </p>

<p class="msonormal5">13.3.3. While there are many strategies that can be
utilized for building trust within a team, leaders should focus their efforts
on leading by example and developing a trusting relationship within the team;
communicate openly and honestly; know team members and establish a good rapport
with team members; discourage cliques or divisions within the team; and
finally, discuss trust issues with the team. Remember, trust is earned and can
be lost. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.4. Ethical Behavior. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">We lose trust in people because of behaviors that reduce
our respect for them. Such behaviors are usually unethical and kill the spirit
of the team. Ethical behaviors, on the other hand, conform to accepted
principles of right and wrong that govern our profession. Team members who
exhibit honesty, integrity, and concern for doing what is right behave
ethically. In his book <i class="calibre2">"Essentials of Management,"</i> author and
Professor of Management, College of Business at Rochester Institute of
Technology, Andrew J. DuBrin said “To a strong team player, getting the group
task accomplished is more important than receiving individual recognition.” He
also outlined the underlying reasons as to why unethical behavior arises in the
team. The primary cause can be closely contributed to one’s “values”. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">13.4.1. Ethics and values operate as a synchronous
unit and is often driven by individual personal interests within the team.
Teams will often experience turmoil when self-interest or greed enters the
team; unconscious biases may lead to stereotypes and affect the judgement of
the team; and the likelihood that a team may rationalize or make unethical
decisions to complete the task or reach their goal. When teams operate with
high standards and moral values, they increase trust and therefore work
cohesively. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.5. Sharing Information: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">13.5.1. If teams are to succeed, they must openly share
information inside and outside the group. This sharing of information involves
both active listening and talking. According to Professor DuBrin, “Information
sharing help other team members do their job well and also communicates concern
for their welfare.” Leaders’ best demonstrate concern for the welfare of other
team members when they actively listen. “The active listener strives to grasp
both the facts and feelings behind what is being said,” Professor DuBrin added.
Active listening and information sharing encourage positive, open, and sincere
communication among team members. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">13.5.2. Teams must communicate. Team members need to
safely assert themselves and share their ideas. Teams that don’t allow honest,
open sharing quickly lose their effectiveness. As a result, some team members
may purposely withhold vital information or disengage from the team. This may
cause confusion, frustration, and the inability to complete tasks within teams.
While sharing information between team members is essential in producing
effective, well-thought-out plans. Also essential is for the leader to share
information with team members. When leaders hold on to information, they can
create an inaccurate, incomplete, or totally wrong picture of the expected
outcome to team members. Information sharing yields better results. Leaders can
increase team success by giving members complete access to all necessary data,
discouraging the discounting of ideas and feelings, and encouraging the
practice of active listening and valuing individual differences. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.6. Critical Judgment. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">When we share information, someone is bound to criticize
our ideas. For a team to be effective, constructive criticism should be
accepted and encouraged. Professor DuBrin said, “A high performance team
demands sincere and tactful criticism among members. The willingness to accept
constructive criticism increases self-awareness and improves team
effectiveness.” Critical judgment enables teams to accept intra-group feedback
(criticism) and outside evaluations, necessary to examine processes and
practices. By using critical feedback, teams can redirect their focus and
energy, and correct problems quickly rather than letting them intensify.  </p>

<p class="msonormal8">13.6.1. Giving constructive criticism occurs when
teams focus on the problem or behavior and not necessarily personal opinions;
when the negative feedback is given at the appropriate time and is not
introduced during a later stage of team development; and lastly when the
individual is given an opportunity to observe and self-correct the problem.
Critical judgment is essential to ensure teams consistently focus in the right
direction.  </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.7. Cooperation: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">13.7.1. Cooperation is critical if teams are to combine
diverse backgrounds, skills, and approaches to meet the challenges, customer
requirements, and mission changes. Cooperation yields synergistic results and
reduces the time it takes to reach a desired outcome. Dr. Zoglio<i class="calibre2"> </i>said,
“At work there are so few solo opportunities; most challenges require the
cooperation of many people. Team members must rely on each other to follow
through on assignments, produce quality results, share creative ideas, and
contribute to a pleasant work environment.” Leaders who encourage cooperation
show team members that others have very important contributions to the goals of
the unit. Team members may also come to understand how dependent they are on
one another in reaching mission objectives. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">13.7.2. Dr. Zoglio further states that successful
teams manage differences through win/win negotiating and reach decisions by
consensus, rather than voting. Successful teams have few turf wars, little
competitiveness, and an ability to forgive and forget. Cooperation breeds shared
ownership for performance results, and achieving objectives increases team
pride and a healthy team spirit. Conversely, competition hinders the
cooperative process, as some team members attempt to outshine others to gain
extra attention. Such “all-starring” leads to in-fighting, making the team less
productive. “All-starring” may also be evidence of a power struggle. To reduce
power-play behavior, leaders should reemphasize each team member’s specific
roles and responsibilities, which eliminates potential barriers to cooperation.
</p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.8. Healthy Team Spirit Summary. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">Cultivating a healthy team spirit requires trust, ethical
behavior, critical judgment, sharing, and cooperation. Trust is at the heart of
any healthy team interaction. Team members must feel comfortable with, and
confident in, one another to be able to fully participate and share their ideas
and feelings. Positive group member behaviors establish the climate of trust
needed to develop a healthy team spirit. Ethical behavior requires members do what
is legally, morally, and professionally right for one another and the
organization. Such behavior is essential to the communication a team needs to
accomplish its goals. Leaders must establish a healthy team spirit to drive
performance and develop effective teams to accomplish the mission. </p>

13C—Managing Resources Other Than Personnel </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.9. Resource Management System: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.9.1.<b class="calibre1"> Resource Management System Defined. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal13">Resource management system does not refer to a single
system. Instead, the Air Force resource management system involves various
systems focusing on outputs and resources used, managers effectively using
resources, measuring actual performance compared to planned performance, and
using financial plans and accounting to enhance management controls at each
organizational level. The resource management system provides a way to
establish priorities, choose policies, and act to get the desired results and
required resources at an acceptable cost. Resource management system elements
include the execution plan, management and accounting systems, participatory
and committee management, resource management teams, and resource management
training.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.9.2.<b class="calibre1"> Resource Management System Duties. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal13">Air Force managers oversee activities that cost money;
however, in terms of resources, resource management system duties refer to the
stewardship of money, manpower, and equipment. Being an effective steward
involves more than legal accountability. Headquarters, United States Air Force
and major commands make decisions about using resources. Although base-level
resource managers do not control initial allocation of all their resources,
they must effectively manage these resources. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">13.9.2.1.<b class="calibre1"> Commanders.</b> Financial management is
inherent to command. Commanders review, validate, and balance the execution
plan to ensure successful financial management. They must actively review
financial programs for each work center (responsibility center) that reports to
them and improve resource management by inquiring about program conditions,
reviewing causes, weighing alternatives, and directing action. They must also
ensure resource management system success by allocating sufficient resources to
resource management system training and resource management team efforts.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal15">13.9.2.2.<b class="calibre1"> Comptrollers. </b>Comptrollers support the
organization’s mission and the Air Force by providing sound financial
management and advice to the commander and staff. They promote responsible and
proper financial management to ensure economical and efficient use of resources
consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements. They apply policies and
procedures that enable the organization to carry out accounting, budget, and
cost functions.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">13.9.2.3.<b class="calibre1"> Responsibility Center Managers.</b>
Responsibility center managers plan, direct, and coordinate subordinate
organizations’ activities. They analyze subordinate organizational plans,
identify imbalances in resource distribution, analyze alternative actions, and
balance programs.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">13.9.2.4.<b class="calibre1"> Cost Center Managers.</b> The cost
center is the basic production flight or work center. The cost center manager
regulates the consumption of work hours, supplies, equipment, and services to
do the tasks within their cost center. Cost center managers shift resources to
or from various production tasks within the cost center to ensure the proper
mix or to provide the emphasis required. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">13.9.2.5. <b class="calibre1">Resource Advisors.</b> Resource
advisors monitor and help prepare resource estimates. They help develop
obligations and expense fund targets, monitor the use of resources in daily
operations compared to projected consumption levels, and serve as the primary
point of contacts on resource management matters pertaining to their
responsibility center. Resource advisors are appointed in writing by the responsibility
center manager.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.9.3.<b class="calibre1"> The Financial Management Board. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal19">Established by the senior or host commander at each
base, the financial management board determines program priorities and ensures
effective allocation of resources. The financial management board reviews and
approves or disapproves recommendations made by the financial working group to
ensure balanced, valid financial programs and to consider all known or
anticipated requirements. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.9.4.<b class="calibre1"> The Financial Working Group. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal20">Composed of both line and staff resource advisors
and responsibility center managers, the financial working group manages
commodities and resources integral to the operating activities of the base or
unit. The financial working group develops requirements and revisions for the
base or unit execution plan, reviews all appropriated fund execution plans, and
makes recommendations to the financial management board for final approval.
Additionally, the financial working group presents recommendations to the
financial management board for unfunded requirement prioritization and fund
target adjustments between responsibility centers, and base-level budgetary
guidance. The financial working group provides technical guidance to base
activities on using their primary responsibility resources.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.10.</b> <b class="calibre1">Effective Use of Government Property:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.10.1.<b class="calibre1"> Supply Discipline. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal21">Air Force members must have a supply discipline to
conserve, protect, and maintain available government supplies, equipment, and
real property for operational requirements. The Air Force’s mission makes it
imperative that all military and civilian personnel operate and maintain
government systems, equipment, supplies, and real property in the best possible
condition, in constant readiness, and in the absolute minimum quantity
necessary to accomplish assigned tasks. Commanders and supervisors at all
levels are responsible for prudent management, control, storage, and
cost-effective use of government property under their control. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">13.10.2.<b class="calibre1"> Roles. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal23">Commanders, subordinates, supervisors, and individuals
must: </p>

<p class="msonormal23">13.10.2.1. Accurately maintain property records to reflect
a current inventory and condition of property. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">13.10.2.2. Ensure personnel carefully and economically use
and safeguard property. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">13.10.2.3. Provide adequate security, protection, and
storage for property. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">13.10.2.4. Make recommendations for preventing fraud,
waste, and abuse. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.10.3.<b class="calibre1"> Custodial Management of Public Property. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal24">A property custodian is any person designated by the
organization commander or chief of staff agency responsible for government
property in his or her possession. A custodian must plan and forecast
requirements to meet mission goals, prepare and forward materiel requests to
the proper agency, sign custody receipts or listings for property charged to
his or her organization, report losses or irregularities relating to property
to his or her immediate commanders or accountable officers, and take action to
reconcile and correct property records. A custodian may be held liable for the
loss, destruction, or damage of any property or resources under his or her
control. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.11. Financial Management: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.11.1.<b class="calibre1"> Use of Resources. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal25">Air Force commanders and supervisors are responsible for
the efficient and economical use of all resources in their organizations.
Commanders and supervisors directly influence the budgeting, allocation,
composition, and distribution of these resources. It should be noted that every
Air Force member is directly involved in and responsible for managing
resources. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.11.2.<b class="calibre1"> Cost-free Resources.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal20">In the following types of instances, everyone has a
principal responsibility to ensure resources are used in the most
cost-effective manner. Keep in mind, all Air Force resources, at one time or
another, had some kind of cost charged to get into the Department of Defense
inventory. Some resources may appear to be cost-free assets because Airmen: </p>

<p class="msonormal23">13.11.2.1. May not either control the determination or allocation
of these resources (real property, weapon systems, and manpower). </p>

<p class="msonormal23">13.11.2.2. May not have the authority to change the mix of
the total resources allocated. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.11.3. <b class="calibre1">The Operating Budget. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal26">The operating budget covers costs associated with
the operation of all Air Force organizations. The approval by higher
headquarters gives obligation authority to accomplish the mission. The budget
program operates on a fiscal year basis (fiscal year represents the period
beginning the first day of October and ending the last day of the following
September [1 October through 30 September].) </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre1">13.12.</b> <b class="calibre1">Fraud, Waste, and Abuse: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.12.1.<b class="calibre1"> Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Defined. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">The Air Force loses millions of dollars in money and
resources every year due to individuals abusing the system, wasting precious
resources, and committing acts of fraud. Fraud, waste and abuse is: </p>

<p class="msonormal29">13.12.1.1. <b class="calibre1">Fraud. </b>Any intentional deception designed
to unlawfully deprive the Air Force of something of value or to secure from the
Air Force for an individual a benefit, privilege, allowance, or consideration
to which he or she is not entitled. Such practices include, but are not limited
to: </p>

<p class="msonormal23">13.12.1.1.1. Offering, paying, accepting bribes or
gratuities, or evading or corrupting inspectors or other officials. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">13.12.1.1.2. Making false statements, submitting false
claims, or using false weights or measures. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">13.12.1.1.3. Using deceit, either by suppressing the truth
or misrepresenting material facts, or deprive the Air Force of something of
value. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">13.12.1.1.4. Adulterating or substituting materials and
falsifying records and books of accounts. </p>

<p class="msonormal28">13.12.1.1.5. Conspiring to carry out any of the actions in
paragraphs 13.12.1.1.1 through 13.12.1.1.4. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">13.12.1.1.6. Engaging in conflict of interest cases,
criminal irregularities, and the unauthorized disclosure of official
information relating to procurement and disposal matters. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b> For
purposes of this handbook, the definition can include any theft or diversion of
resources for personal or commercial gain. </p>

<p class="msonormal31">13.12.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Waste.</b> The extravagant, careless, or
needless expenditure of Air Force funds or the consumption of Air Force
property that results from deficient practices, systems controls, or decisions
is waste. Waste also includes improper practices not involving prosecutable
fraud. <b class="calibre1">Note:<i class="calibre2"> </i></b>Consider wartime and emergency operations when
explaining possible waste. For example, legitimate stockpiles and reserves for
wartime needs, which may appear redundant and costly, are not considered waste.
</p>

<p class="msonormal14">13.12.1.3. <b class="calibre1">Abuse. </b>The intentionally wrongful
or improper use of Air Force resources is abuse. Examples include misuse of
rank, position, or authority that causes the loss or misuse of resources such
as tools, vehicles, computers, or copy machines. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.12.2.<b class="calibre1"> Preventing Fraud, Waste and Abuse.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal32">Preventing fraud, waste and abuse is of primary
concern. Detection and prosecution serve to deter fraudulent, wasteful, or
abusive practices; however, the key element of the program is to prevent the
loss of resources. The Secretary of the Air Force, Inspector General, provides
policy guidance, develops procedures, and establishes and evaluates the Air
Force complaints and fraud, waste and abuse programs. In turn, inspector
generals at every level are responsible for establishing and directing the Air
Force complaints and fraud, waste and abuse programs. Air Force personnel have
a duty to promptly report fraud, waste and abuse to an appropriate supervisor
or commander, to an Inspector General or other appropriate inspector, or
through an established grievance channel. Fraud, waste and abuse complaints may
be reported to the Air Force Audit Agency, the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations, security forces, or other proper authorities. Further, all
military and civilian members must promptly advise the Air Force Office of
Special Investigations of suspected criminal misconduct or fraud. The Air Force
Office of Special Investigations investigates criminal allegations. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.12.3.<b class="calibre1"> Fraud, Waste and Abuse Complaints:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal13">13.12.3.1. <b class="calibre1">Resolution. </b>As with personal complaints,
Air Force members should try resolving fraud, waste and abuse issues at the
lowest possible level using command channels before addressing them to a higher
level or the Inspector General. Individuals may submit: </p>

<p class="msonormal30">13.12.3.1.1. Fraud, waste and abuse disclosures by
memorandum, in person, or by fraud, waste and abuse hotlines. </p>

<p class="msonormal28">13.12.3.1.2. Complaints anonymously. </p>

<p class="msonormal26"><b class="calibre1">Note:</b> Making a disclosure or complaint
requires factual, unbiased, and specific information. Individuals must understand
they are submitting official statements within Air Force channels. Therefore,
they remain subject to punitive action (or adverse administrative action) for
knowingly making false statements and for submitting other unlawful
communications. Information in a disclosure or complaint to an Inspector
General is protected. </p>

<p class="msonormal33">13.12.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Complainant Privacy.</b> The complainant’s
privacy is safeguarded to the maximum extent practicable to encourage voluntary
cooperation and promote a climate of openness in identifying issues requiring
leadership intervention. The Inspector General has the responsibility to
safeguard the personal identity and complaints of individuals seeking
assistance or participating in an Inspector General process such as an
investigation. While this does not mean the communications made to an Inspector
General are privileged or confidential, it does mean that disclosure of those
communications (and the identity of the communicant) is strictly limited to an
official need-toknow basis. </p>

<p class="msonormal34">13.12.3.3. <b class="calibre1">Disclosure.</b> This information is not
disclosed unless required by law or regulation, when necessary to take adverse
action against a subject, with the approval of the Secretary of the Air Force,
Inspector General. </p>

<p class="msonormal35">13.12.3.4. <b class="calibre1">Summary of the Results. </b>Individuals
making a complaint may request a summary of the results from the office to
which the complaint was made. However, witnesses (including complainants and
subjects) do not have unrestricted access to reports, complainants, and
subjects, or any other case file information by virtue of their status as a
witness. They have access to Inspector General records as provided for by the
Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act. </p>

<p class="msonormal36">13.12.3.5. <b class="calibre1">Whistleblower Rights.</b> Whistleblower
witnesses have additional rights. The nature of the allegation and findings
will determine what information is releasable. All information released is
according to Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act. “Third-party”
complainants are not entitled to a response regarding alleged wrongs not directly
affecting them unless authorized to receive via a Freedom of Information Act or
a Privacy Act release. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">13.12.3.6. <b class="calibre1">Inspector General Channels.</b> If the
Inspector General receives a complaint or disclosure more appropriate for
another channel may be referred to that channel by the receiving Inspector
General. When Inspectors General refer complaints to command or other more
appropriate resolution channels, Inspectors General notify complainants of the
referral, except for anonymous complainants. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.13. Air Force Environmental Commitment. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal37"><i class="calibre2">Leadership at
all levels and across all mission operations and support organizations must use
the Air Force Environmental Management System’s approach to comply with

<p class="msonormal26">The United States Air Force is a leader and devoted
guardian of the environment. As trustee to over 8 million acres of natural
habitat, the Air Force takes considerable measures to defend and enhance
America’s rich natural resources and cultural heritage. Over the last 20 years,
the Air Force has followed a compliance-based approach to environmental
management resulting in an unparalleled record of responsiveness to regulation,
community interests, and ecological needs. Yet, to meet current and future
mission requirements, the Air Force environmental program must ensure
environmental resources, such as air, land, and water, are available to meet
operational needs. This approach allows the Air Force to <i class="calibre2">sustain, restore,

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.14. Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution
Philosophy. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">The ultimate objective of the planning, programming,
budgeting, and execution process is to provide the best mix of forces, equipment,
manpower, and support attainable within fiscal constraints according to
Department of Defense Directive 7045.14, <i class="calibre2">The Planning, Programming,
Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) Process</i>. The goal of the planning,
programming, budgeting, and execution process is to achieve the defense
objectives established by the President and the Secretary of Defense in the
strategic planning and joint planning guidance. The Air Force uses a unique
process for implementing the planning, programming, budgeting, and execution<b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">—</i></b>the
Air Force corporate structure. This structure increases management
effectiveness by applying judgment and experience to programs, resource
limitations, and other program adjustments. This enables senior leadership to
assess alternative ways to achieve the planning, programming, budgeting, and
execution objective. The Air Force develops their program to achieve defense
objectives established by the President and the Secretary of Defense as well as
internal Air Force strategic planning objectives. The formulation of the Air
Force budget is a complicated and time-consuming endeavor. Planning,
programming, budgeting, and execution is a shared process within the Air Force
with significant responsibility delegated to the Director of Programs, Deputy
Chief of Staff for Plans and Programs (AF/A8P), and the Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Budget, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for
Financial Management and Comptroller (SAF/FMB). </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.15. Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution
Process. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal6">The planning, programming, budgeting, and execution process
is the Department of Defense’s resource allocation system. This process has a
framework that decides on future capabilities and provides an opportunity to
reexamine prior decisions in light of evolving threats, economic conditions,
and security concerns. Finally, planning, programming, budgeting, and execution
is an iterative process consisting of four interrelated and overlapping phases:
planning, programming, budgeting, and execution.<b class="calibre1"> </b>13.15.1.<b class="calibre1"> Planning. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal36">The Air Force translates top-down guidance into meaningful
plans and requirements for which a program for the future year’s defense
program can be developed. Planning defines and examines alternative strategies
and analyzes external conditions and trends. Planning provides the means to
anticipate changes and understand the long-term implications of near-term
choices and decisions. Streamlined planning and assessment documents help
prioritize objectives, assess strategies, and provide the link between planning
and programming. Within the concept of planning, programming, budgeting, and
execution, planning also provides a program objective against which the Air
Force can measure program execution success.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal49">13.15.2.<b class="calibre1"> Programming.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal26">Through the programming processes, the Air Force and
other military department’s link planned requirements with the resources needed
to provide them. Inevitably, this will involve tradeoffs beyond those agreed to
in the planning process. By programming, the Air Force matches available
resources (fiscal, manpower, and materiel) against validated requirements to
achieve the strategic plan and submit program proposals. Planning policies and
guidance are addressed and initial program costs are established. The key
objective of programming is to develop a balanced, capabilities-based Air Force
program in the form of the Air Force program objective memorandum. In addition,
through the programming processes, the Air Force defends the program objective
memorandum during program review and budget review and adjusts the program as a
result of the Office of the Secretary of Defense reviews and changing national
and international situations. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.15.3.<b class="calibre1"> Budgeting.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal13">The budgeting phase of planning, programming, budgeting, and
execution occurs concurrently with the programming phase. Each Department of
Defense component submits a proposed budget estimate simultaneously with a
program objective memorandum. The budgeting phase (formulation and
justification) provides a platform for a detailed review of a program’s
pricing, phasing, and overall capability to be executed on time and within
budget. The budgeting process principally addresses the years to be justified
in the President’s budget. Three things happen in the preparation of the budget
estimate submission. First, Air Force budget analysts identify situations where
the program has put Air Force resources at risk of Office of the Secretary of
Defense or Congressional reduction. Second, the comptroller applies the latest
inflation figures, flying hour and manpower rates, etc. Third, the program is
put into the Office of the Secretary of Defense budget format and budget
justification documentation is prepared. Once these steps are complete, the
final position is called the program objective memorandum/budget estimate
submission or program budget review. The budgeting phase continues with the
program budget review submission and fact-of-life changes via notification
document in the off-year. Secretary of the Air Force for financial management
and comptroller is the Air Force lead for budget and budget execution. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.15.4.<b class="calibre1"> Budget Execution.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal36">Budget execution focuses on running the Air Force day to
day. Execution is carried out at the Headquarters Air Force, field operating
agency, major command, primary support unit, wing, and unit level. The Air
Force major commands (including the Headquarters Air Force) are allocated their
share of obligation authority to execute their missions in accordance to
approved integrated priority lists for those programs that are centrally
managed. Because the budget being executed in any given year was actually
compiled over a year earlier, you should logically assume some assumptions on
which the budget was based will have changed. Because change is anticipated,
Congress allows some flexibility within the operating budgets to move resources
without requiring their permission but installations are expected to execute to
the integrated priority list for centrally managed programs. One key part of
budget execution is the major command’s operations and maintenance operation
plan. Air Force program execution is reviewed during major command budget
execution reviews in February, April (concurrent with the internal Air Force
midyear review), and July. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.16. Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution
Summary.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal50">Every leader contributes to the planning, programming,
budgeting, and execution process. Within this system, leaders help establish
and forecast a budget to ensure sufficient funds are available to accomplish
the mission. Thoughtful and accurate estimates on the local level are extremely
important in reflecting the overall Air Force needs. Wise day-to-day resource
management is essential to having an effective planning, programming,
budgeting, and execution process. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section
13E—Manpower Management and Competitive Sourcing </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.17. Manpower Resources. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal40">Manpower is a constrained resource that comprises a
large portion of the Air Force Budget. All missions and programs compete for
limited authorized military and civilian end-strength, established grade
distributions, and must comply with other guidelines as directed by Congress.
Manpower must be programmed in accordance with validated manpower requirements,
and within fiscal limits and acceptable risk identified in defense planning and
programming guidance. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.18. Chain of Responsibilities.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal8">The Directorate of Manpower, Organization and
Resources, Program Development Division (Headquarters Air Force/A1MP) allocates
programmed manpower resources by command identifier, program element code,
resource identification code, and country State code to the commands directing
implementation of approved programs. Major commands and equivalents translate
these manpower resources into manpower authorizations by updating the unit
manpower document. The installation manpower and organization flight is the
liaison between installation agencies and the major command A1M staff for all
manpower and organization issues. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.19. Manpower Resource Levels: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.19.1. <b class="calibre1">Changing Manpower Allocations.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal31">Command-specific military and civilian manpower
requirements must be validated by the major command A1M and approved by
Headquarters Air Force A1M before they can be used in the programming and
resourcing process. Before manpower allocations can be changed, the requesting
organization must give reasons for the requested change. The major command must
propose specific tradeoffs if the initiative requires an increase in military
or civilian manpower. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.19.2. <b class="calibre1">Accommodating Temporary Manpower Requirements.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal36">End-strength will not be programmed to accommodate cyclical
or temporary requirements. Instead major commands and equivalents should use
other means to accomplish their short term mission or surge workload to
include: (1) use available funds and command civilian employment plans to
employ civilians; (2) utilize overtime, temporary full-time, part-time, or
over-hire of civilian personnel; (3) seek support from the Air Reserve
Component via Military Pay Appropriation funds; (4) utilize temporary duty
military and civilian personnel; and (5) seek contract service. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.20. Requirements Determination: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.20.1. <b class="calibre1">General Concept.  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal14">Manpower and organization flight personnel assist
Air Force commanders and functional managers at all levels in mission
accomplishment by objectively quantifying manpower requirements for the
distribution of Air Force manpower resources. Key services of this competency
include peacetime manpower standards development, wartime manpower
requirements, and commercial services management actions (for example,
public-private competition, in-sourcing, and business process reengineering).
The foundation of any manpower requirements determination effort is the
application of Continuous Process Improvement methodologies to a function’s
processes to make process improvements. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.20.2. <b class="calibre1">Determining Manpower Requirements: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal51">13.20.2.1. The Air Force manpower requirements
determination process systematically identifies minimumessential manpower
required for the most effective and economical accomplishment of approved
missions and functions within organizational and resource constraints. To
accomplish this, Headquarters Air Force functional managers work with
Headquarters Air Force A1M to determine the appropriate manpower management
tool consistent with resources needed to develop the manpower standard; the
required mix of military, civilian, and/or contract services; and the required
military category (officer or enlisted) and grade. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">13.20.2.2. Determining the correct amount of military
manpower required to meet the Air Force’s most stringent wartime missions is
key to achieving the National Military Strategy and the Defense Planning
Guidance. The Defense Planning Guidance defines the planning scenarios used to
size and shape the Total Force. These include the amount of military needed for
deployment and fight in-place missions for the given scenario. Manpower
requirements are sized for the most demanding phase of the scenario construct,
including all rotational forces needed for prolonged conflicts. These scenarios
drive force structure and manpower military mix budgeting decisions. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.20.3. <b class="calibre1">Organization:  </b></p>

<p class="msonormal52">13.20.3.1. The Air Force must be organized to best use
available resources. This requires simple, streamlined structures designed for
seamless transition from peace to war. The principal characteristics desired in
Air Force organizations include mission orientation, unambiguous command,
decentralization, agility, flexibility, simplicity, and standardization.  </p>

<p class="msonormal53">13.20.3.2. Manpower standards are
established to ensure work center operations are efficient and standardized to
create the most efficient organization. The ultimate goal of organizational
performance is mission accomplishment. Resource requirements reflected in a
manpower standard should be based on organization and process design, which
most effectively and efficiently accomplishes the mission. Improving mission
effectiveness while maintaining or improving efficiency should be the goal of
any modification to a function’s current organizational or process design.  </p>

<p class="msonormal23">Efficiency does not necessarily mean decreasing resources
but rather improving the return on the resources used. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.20.4. <b class="calibre1">Performance Improvement. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal26">Improving performance requires both planning and
execution. For organizational change effort effectiveness, they generally must
include some redesign and/or coordination on five fronts. These fronts are
related organizational areas to consider. A change on one front may require
actions or changes on another. For example, changing a process may also require
some training or retraining (people front); the process improvement may affect
how technology is used (technology front); or the process design may require
updates to regulations (policy, legislation, regulation front). The five fronts
(see figure 13.2) are: </p>

<p class="msonormal20">13.20.4.1. <b class="calibre1">Organization and People. </b>Human
resources are the key to future viability and organizational growth in a
continuously learning environment. Although processes and other front factors
may change, focus should remain on providing workers with appropriate
knowledge, skills, experiences, and tools. This will empower them to learn and
act, which will tie their rewards to the organization’s values and measures. </p>

<p class="msonormal52">13.20.4.2. <b class="calibre1">Technology. </b>Technology is a crucial
enabling factor that allows compression of cycles, lead time, distance, and
broader access to information and knowledge assets. Technology also eliminates
barriers between customers and suppliers. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">13.20.4.3. <b class="calibre1">Policies, Legislation, and Regulations. </b>Changing
existing policies, regulations, and legislation may be required for new
processes. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">13.20.4.4. <b class="calibre1">Physical Infrastructure. </b>The physical
facilities, equipment, and tools should be designed to support and maximize changes
in workflow, information technology, and human resources. </p>

<p class="msonormal36">13.20.4.5. <b class="calibre1">Process. </b>The flow of work and information
into, and throughout the organization must be redesigned using standard
Continuous Process Improvement methodologies like Business Process Engineering,
Lean, Six Sigma, and Theory of Constraints. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.21. Unit Manpower Document.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal70">The unit manning document, used to help manage
manpower resources, is a computer product that lists unit funded and unfunded
manpower requirements, and contains many data elements that identify the unique
position attributes. These attributes include position number, Air Force
specialty code, functional account code, office symbol code, grade, personnel
accounting symbol, reason code, etc. The unit manning document is the primary
document that reflects the manpower required to accomplish the unit mission.
The installation manpower and organization office will periodically, or upon
request, supply a unit with an updated unit manning document. Supervisors
should routinely check the unit manning document for accuracy and use it to
track their authorized manpower strength. Headquarters Air Force A1M and the
Air Force Manpower Analysis Agency often produce reports based on unit manning
document data; continuous review of coding is critical for proper position
management. See Figure 13.3. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.22.1.<b class="calibre1"> Keeping Unit Manpower Documents Current. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal13">The unit manpower document displays current and projected
requirements and can be configured to display desired fields in various
formats. Unit commanders and supervisors may request a unit manpower document
from the installation manpower and organization flight on an as-needed basis.
Typically, the unit manpower point of contact serves as the liaison between the
unit and manpower and organization flight; thus, work center supervisors should
coordinate any unit manpower document changes, etc., with their unit manpower
point of contact. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.22.2.<b class="calibre1"> Funded and Unfunded Requirements and the Enlisted
Grades Allocation Program: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal85">13.22.2.1. The terms “manpower requirement” and
“manpower authorization” are often misunderstood. A manpower requirement is a
statement of manpower needed to accomplish a job, workload, mission, or
program.  The two types of manpower requirements are funded and unfunded.
Funded manpower requirements are those that have been validated and allocated.
Funded manpower requirements are also known as authorizations. Unfunded
requirements are validated manpower needs that are deferred because of
budgetary constraints. </p>

<p class="msonormal36">13.22.2.2. Some actions not only affect authorization
levels but can also impact funded grades. The enlisted grades allocation
program is designed to ensure enlisted grades are equitably allocated to
Headquarters Air Force, major commands, field operating agencies, and direct
reporting units, and at the same time not exceed constraints. A grade imbalance
between what is required and what is funded (authorized) can occur as a result
of legislative and budgetary constraints on the allocated grades. For example,
Chief Master Sergeants are constrained to 1 percent of the total enlisted
force.  </p>

<p class="msonormal86">13.22.2.3. Headquarters Air Force implements congressional
and Department of Defense grade constraints by creating grade factors. Two
types of factors created and distributed are: (1) overall command grade factors
for each enlisted grade; and (2) career progression group factors for each Air
Force specialty code to the first three digits. Command grade factors ensure
authorized grades do not exceed command-ceiling constraints. The career
progression group factors ensure equitable allocation of the grades within each
Air Force specialty code in each command. Both types of factors are applied to
the budgeted end-strength. Air Force career field managers can recommend
adjustments to Head Quarters Air Force A1M, Directorate of Manpower,
Organization and Resources. When making adjustments, they must maintain a zero
balance of total grades allocated for each command. Commands may engage in
grade swaps, via the Air Force career field manager, which in-turn may impact
the respective factors. The factors themselves cannot be swapped. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.23. Initiating and Tracking Manpower Changes: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7">13.23.1. Periodically, a unit may need to change an
existing requirement on the unit manning document. An authorization change
request (may also be referred to as “manpower change request”) is used to
request this change. The unit point of contact identifies the requested change
and provides detailed justification to the servicing manpower, organization and
resources flight. The manpower and organization section evaluates the request,
enters it into the manpower programming and execution system, and makes a
recommendation for approval or disapproval to the major command. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">13.23.2. Many actions necessitate an authorization change
request. Some of the most frequent are Air Force specialty code changes,
position realignments, redistribution of funding from a funded requirement to
an unfunded requirement, and grade conversions. Many factors must be considered
when a unit proposes a change. Common considerations include: (1) determining
how the change affects the organizational structure; (2) ensuring the manpower
realignment does not exceed the requirements allowed by Air Force manpower
standards; (3) ensuring the requested change complies with current programming
guidelines; and (4) ensuring the requested change does not adversely impact the
unit‘s ability to deploy or perform its wartime mission. </p>

<p class="msonormal8">13.23.3. Changes to the unit manning document must
be processed within resource constraints (i.e. no net increase in resources)
minus no net increase in resources, grades, etc. For example, if a unit wants
to fund a position that is currently unfunded, a funded position must be
identified for conversion to unfund and detailed rationale for the change
provided. The servicing manpower and organization flight will work closely with
the unit point of contact when developing an authorization change request. Unit
commander approval of authorization change request actions is required prior to
submission of the authorization change request to the major command point of
contact with the exception of actions resulting from a public-private
competition or in-sourcing initiative. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">13.23.4. Approved changes to the unit manning
document are reflected by an authorization change notice generated by the
manpower programming and execution system. The authorization change notice
provides details of the approved change and the rationale for the change. The
manpower and organization flight will, in turn, provide a copy of the
authorization change notice to the affected unit‘s point of contact. If the
request is disapproved, the major command provides rationale to the submitting
unit through the servicing manpower and organization flight. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.24. Manpower and Organization Flight. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal8">The installation manpower and organization flight
performs a variety of functions to help effectively manage manpower resources.
The core competencies of the manpower and organization flight encompass
organization structure, requirement determination, program allocation and
control, and process improvement. Personnel within the manpower and
organization flight provide day-to-day manpower resource management services to
include unit manning document management, assisting with authorization change
requests, authorization change notices, and organizational structure changes.
Manpower and organization flight personnel also provide other management
services, such as performance management, commercial activity services, Airmen
Powered by Innovation Program, Continuous Process Improvement and management
advisory studies. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.25. Commercial Services Management: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.25.1.<b class="calibre1"> Purpose. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal20">Commercial services management is a program designed
to improve functions using a variety of management tools including competitive
sourcing, in-sourcing, and post-competition accountability. The three principal
goals of commercial services management are to sustain readiness, improve
performance and quality by doing business more efficiently and cost
effectively, and focus available personnel and resources on core Air Force
missions. Commercial services management will not affect military-essential
skills or those functions that are inherently governmental. </p>

<p class="msonormal87">13.25.1.1. Military Essential skills are defined as skills

Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998 defines an inherently
governmental function as one that is so intimately related to the public
interest as to require performance by federal government employees. Functions
may include the determination of budget policy, guidance, and strategy; the
determination of the content and application of policies and regulations; the
selection of individuals for federal government employment; and obligating
money on behalf of the government. For example, warranted contracting officers
are inherently governmental because they are responsible for making decisions
on behalf of the government. They are the signature authority for committing
government funds. The entire contracting staff, however; does not necessarily
satisfy the same criteria. Contracting personnel who research and provide
information, advice, etc., to the warranted contracting officers do not
necessarily have to be government personnel. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.26. Competitive Sourcing Process. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal22">AFI 38-203, <i class="calibre2">Commercial Activities Program</i>, defines a
structured process for determining whether to perform work inhouse or through
contract. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.26.1. <b class="calibre1">Competitive Sourcing Study:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal85">13.26.1.1. A competitive sourcing study is a
public-private competition that compares the total cost of the in-house government
operation of an activity to the total cost of private sector performance of the
same activity. The study results determine whether a commercial activity can be
done more economically and efficiently by contract or by an in-house workforce.
</p>

<p class="msonormal26">13.26.1.2. During the competitive sourcing study,
the in-house government operation is reengineered into a most efficient
organization and submitted in the competition as the agency‘s tender which is
the government‘s proposal for how it will perform the work. The process of
developing a most efficient organization emphasizes innovation in meeting the
requirements laid out in the solicitation for the work being completed. The
most efficient organization is allowed latitude in its organization and
processes outside of the standard Air Force structure to enable greater
efficiency and effectiveness. </p>

<p class="msonormal88">13.26.2. <b class="calibre1">Competitive Sourcing Impact:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal26">13.26.2.1. Air Force policy is to minimize both the
adverse effects on personnel and the disruption to the affected organizations.
Adversely affected personnel are provided the right of first refusal for
contractor jobs, for which they are qualified, in the event the government is
unable to place them in other federal positions. </p>

<p class="msonormal31">13.26.2.2. Competitive sourcing generates savings by
finding more efficient ways to accomplish a particular function. A competitive
sourcing study also frees up military personnel to perform other core military
essential activities. In a competitive sourcing study, the mission remains
essentially unchanged; the composition of the workforce is what changes. Where
blue suiters were initially performing the mission, the resulting service
provider will be made up of either civil servants or private sector contract
employees. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.27. In-sourcing: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.27.1.<b class="calibre1"> Origin and Authorization: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal85">13.27.1.1. In-sourcing is the conversion of a
contracted function to Department of Defense civilian or military performance,
or any combination thereof. Although OMB Circular A-76 provides a structured
process for converting contracts to in-house performance through public-private
competition, 10 United States Code, Section 2463, <i class="calibre2">Guidelines and Procedures
for Use of Civilian Employees to Perform Department of Defense Functions</i>,
permits Department of Defense components to convert contracts without applying
the Circular‘s requirements. 10 United States Code, Section 2463 provides for
special consideration to using Department of Defense civilian employees to
perform any function that is currently performed by a contractor and meets any
of the following criteria: </p>

<p class="msonormal23">13.27.1.1.1. Has been performed by Department of Defense
civilian employees at any time during the previous 10 years. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">13.27.1.1.2. Is closely associated with the performance of
an inherently governmental function. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">13.27.1.1.3. Has been performed pursuant to a contract
awarded on a noncompetitive basis. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">13.27.1.1.4. Has been determined by a contracting officer
to have been performed poorly during the 5 years preceding the date of such
determination, because of excessive costs or inferior quality. </p>

<p class="msonormal20">13.27.1.2. Furthermore, in accordance with the
Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum, In-sourcing contracted services-implementation
guidance, contracted functions found to be inherently governmental, exempt from
contract performance, unauthorized personal services, or experiencing problems
associated with contract administration shall be in-sourced regardless of cost.
</p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.27.2.<b class="calibre1"> In-sourcing Business Case Analysis: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal35">13.27.2.1. An insourcing Business Case Analysis compares
the cost of a contracted function to the cost of Department of Defense civilian
employees to perform the same activity. The Business Case Analysis justifies
the decision to in-source when based on cost. Included in the Business Case
Analysis are certifications validating contract cost, in-house manning,
available labor pool, and activity meets the requirements of a valid and
enduring mission requirement. Installations and major commands develop Business
Case Analysis, and Air Force manpower analysis agency validates Business Case
Analysis as part of the Air Force in-sourcing approval process. Cost models are
built using COMPARE, an Air Force manpower analysis agency provided tool that
incorporates guidance and factors to estimating and comparing the full costs of
civilian and military manpower and contract Support. </p>

<p class="msonormal89">13.27.2.2. If new or expanded requirements or functions
performed under contract are determined to be inherently governmental or exempt
from private sector performance for reasons stated in DoDI 1100.22, <i class="calibre2">Policy
and Procedures for Determining Workforce Mix</i>, the functions shall be
converted to government performance without an economic analysis. In all other
cases a cost comparison is required and serves as the key component of the
Business Case Analysis. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.28. Responsibilities. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal90">Headquarters Air Force A1M is responsible for
implementing the Air Force commercial services management program.  Air Force
manpower analysis agency develops and maintains tools, templates, and
guidebooks to enable the field to execute the program, administers the
inherently governmental/commercial activities inventory, monitors post
competition accountability, and provides field support on commercial services
management initiatives. Major command A1M is the manpower function responsible
for providing commercial services management oversight at command levels and
providing guidance to manpower and organization flights for implementation of
the commercial services management program at the respective wings. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section
13F—Government Property and Equipment </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre1">13.29. General Responsibilities: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal91">13.29.1. The Air Force mission requires that all military
and civilian personnel operate and maintain Government systems, equipment, supplies,
and real property in the best possible condition, in constant readiness, and in
the absolute minimum quantity necessary to accomplish assigned tasks. </p>

<p class="msonormal92">13.29.2. Commanders must manage public property under
their control, including proper care and use, provide instructions to
subordinates on their specific responsibilities, and maintain records that may
be audited. Commanders and supervisors establish controls to eliminate
uneconomical equipment management, ensure all personnel are taught proper care
and safeguard principles, and enforce these principles. Logistics readiness
squadrons offer training on a variety of topics for different management
levels. Commanders appoint representatives and ensure the representatives
attend the proper training. For example, primary and alternate equipment
custodians attend mandatory Block III computer-based training accompanied by a
supplemental Block III training provided by the logistics readiness squadron’s
equipment accountability element. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">13.29.3. The Air Force equipment management system
provides a standard equipment management system applicable to all Air Force
activities. This system is web-enabled and requires a password for access. Air
Force equipment management system provides worldwide visibility of all in-use
and warehoused equipment assets and is used to report capitalized asset
depreciation, determine equipment requirements based on Air Force allowance
standards, support the budget and buy program, and report equipment types and
quantities required to accomplish the mission. The allowance standards are
provided both online in the Air Force equipment management system and offline
via compact disk. The allowance standards include specific items and authorized
quantities required for the wartime and peacetime needs of each unit. </p>

<p class="msonormal93"><b class="calibre1">13.30. Property Accounting.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal6">The organization commander or equivalent designates a
property custodian for Government property used by the unit and listed on
allowance standard documents. Upon assuming responsibility and at least
annually, the designated property custodian must perform an inventory of all
assets. The custodian signs the custodian authorization/custody receipt listing
acknowledging completion of the inventory and signifying all items listed are
being used properly and maintained in serviceable condition. After the inventory
is completed, the custodian signs the acknowledgement of responsibility block
which allows the custodian to become accountable for the property physically in
possession, then obtains the commander’s signature as validation that the
inventory took place and actions are underway to resolve discrepancies. The
property custodian is relieved of responsibility only when the account is
transferred to another custodian, issues or turns in items and obtains a signed
receipt, or provides authorized adjustment documents (turn-in receipts,
transfer documents, etc.). </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre1">13.31. Report of Survey.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A report of survey is used to research and investigate the
cause of loss, damage, destruction, or theft of Government property and to
determine if the cause of loss was attributable to an individual’s negligence
or abuse. The final report is used to assess financial liability against the
persons responsible or to relieve them from liability if there is no evidence
of negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use of the
property. The report of survey also serves as a source document to adjust
accountable records and provides a tool for commanders to identify deficiencies
requiring corrective action to prevent recurring incidents. AFMAN 23-220, <i class="calibre2">Reports
of Survey for Air Force Property,</i> identifies procedures for processing a
report of survey and implementing the report of survey program. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.31.1.<b class="calibre1"> When to Complete a Report of Survey: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal94">13.31.1.1.<i class="calibre2"> </i>With some exceptions, a report of
survey must be completed for all Government property lost, damaged, destroyed,
or stolen. The property can be real or personal. Air Force real property
includes buildings and items attached to them, such as air-conditioners and
compressors. Anything not real property, such as parkas, tools, desks,
equipment, and vehicles is personal property. </p>

<p class="msonormal28">13.31.1.2. A report of survey is not necessary when: </p>

<p class="msonormal13">13.31.1.2.1. The individual responsible for the loss or
damage makes voluntary payment, and loss, damage, destruction, or theft of
property is $500 or less. This policy does not prevent the initiation of a
report of survey if the loss is less than $500, evidence of negligence, or a
systematic loss of property by the same individual over a period of time. </p>

<p class="msonormal95">13.31.1.2.2. Investigation of the loss, damage, or
destruction of a vehicle indicates no evidence of gross negligence, willful
misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use. The commander may still take action
against individuals in these cases using punitive or administrative options. </p>

<p class="msonormal28">13.31.1.2.3. Do not use assessment of financial liability
as a form of disciplinary action. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.31.2.<b class="calibre1"> Initiating a Report of Survey:</b><i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal28">13.31.2.1.<i class="calibre2"> </i>Generally, the organization possessing
the lost or damaged property is responsible for initiating a report of survey
even if the property is deployed or issued on a hand-receipt outside the
organization. </p>

<p class="msonormal96">13.31.2.2. Depending on the organizational structure, the
commander normally initiates the proceedings by appointing an investigating
official. The investigating official will be an officer, senior NCO, or
civilian employee (General Schedule-7, Wage Grade-9, Wage Leader-5, or Wage
Supervisor-1 or above). The investigator must be a disinterested, impartial
individual who has no interest or involvement in the custodianship, care,
accountability, or safekeeping of the property in question. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.31.3.<b class="calibre1"> Report of Survey Investigation. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal30">At a minimum, the investigating official will perform the
following steps during an investigation: </p>

<p class="msonormal97">13.31.3.1.<i class="calibre2"> </i>Develop the facts in the case which will
lead to the findings and recommendations. The investigator must interview any
persons with knowledge of the case if they are in the immediate area. This
includes the person who may have lost, damaged, destroyed, or stolen the
property. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">13.31.3.2. Obtain written statements from persons
interviewed and obtain sworn statements in accordance with the <i class="calibre2">Manual for
Courts-Martial,</i> Appendix 2, Section 936. This section authorizes the
investigator to swear witnesses. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">13.31.3.3. Ensure the findings and the recommendations are
supported by the testimony of persons involved and that the testimony leads
logically to the findings and recommendations. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">13.31.3.4. Determine if financial liability should be
assessed based strictly on the facts and circumstances of the case. If
financial liability is recommended based on value on the property involved and
not the fact that financial liability generally is limited not to exceed one
month’s pay or by statements made to the investigating officer by the person
involved and the assessment of financial liability will cause personal
hardship. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b> Reducing the recommended assessment of financial
liability is a command prerogative and not within the purview of the
investigating officer. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.31.4.<b class="calibre1"> Liability: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal98">13.31.4.1. All Air Force members and employees can be held
liable for the loss, damage, or destruction of Government property proximately
caused by their negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use.
</p>

<p class="msonormal23">13.31.4.2. Persons who have lost, damaged, destroyed, or
stolen Government property valued at $500 or less may voluntarily pay for the
property. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.31.5.<b class="calibre1"> Processing the Report of Survey: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal20">13.31.5.1.<i class="calibre2"> </i>After the investigation is
complete, the investigating official allows the persons involved to review the
case and provide verbal or written information to refute the findings and
recommendations. In the process of refuting the findings of a report of survey,
an Airman may seek advice from the local area defense counsel. </p>

<p class="msonormal99">13.31.5.2. The report of survey is then processed to
the appointing authority to assign financial responsibility against the
individual charged or relieve him or her from responsibility. If financial
responsibility is assessed, refer the report of survey to the legal office for
review. </p>

<p class="msonormal100">13.31.5.3. At the time the report of survey is submitted for
acknowledgment by the individual charged, he or she is advised the report of

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre1">13.32. Installation Commander Responsibilities. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal101">The installation commander has overall responsibility and
accountability for the operation of an Air Force installation. The major
command and installation commander, assisted by the base civil engineer, are
responsible for the following: </p>

<p class="msonormal22">13.32.1. Develop, operate, maintain, and control the use of
Air Force facilities in compliance with applicable Department of Defense and Air
Force policies and procedures. </p>

<p class="msonormal102">13.32.2. Develop comprehensive asset management
plans, identify facility lifecycle requirements, implement applicable common
levels of service, assess the impact of asset condition on mission support
through the use of key performance indicators, and develop and execute real
property construction, sustainment, restoration, and modernization programs. </p>

<p class="msonormal103"><b class="calibre1">13.33. Responsibilities of the Using Organization: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal104">13.33.1. Successful facility management relies
heavily upon the using organization. The using organization’s unit commander
will ensure requirements for real property alterations, additions, or new
construction are identified to the base civil engineer or wing commander when
required. </p>

<p class="msonormal105">13.33.2. The unit commander designates in writing an
officer, E-5 and above, or civilian equivalent, as primary and alternate
facility managers for each facility assigned to the organization. In
multipurpose facilities, the major user should be assigned as the primary
facility manager. Other organizations using a portion of a multipurpose
facility are encouraged to appoint an alternate facility manager for their
respective area. </p>

<p class="msonormal104">13.33.3. Work that alters real property in any way,
to include modifications or repair, requires approval from the base civil
engineer. Facility managers submit work requests to the base civil engineer
customer service unit utilizing established processes. The base civil engineer
determines the execution method for work that is approved. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">13.33.4. Emergency work, defined as work that corrects an
issue that poses an immediate threat to mission, life, safety, or health will
be identified to customer service unit by the quickest means possible, to
include verbal or phone communication. All other forms of work will be
identified to the customer service unit by the facility manager utilizing the
Air Force Form 332, <i class="calibre2">Base Civil Engineer Work Request</i>, or designated
information technology systems. </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre1">13.34. Base Civil Engineer Squadron Responsibilities: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal91">13.34.1. The base civil engineer is charged to provide,
operate, maintain, restore, and protect the built and natural infrastructure
necessary to support the Air Force mission. As such, the base civil engineer
serves as the focal point for all construction, sustainment, restoration, and
modernization of facilities identified as real property and associated real
property installed equipment. </p>

<p class="msonormal106">13.34.2. The base civil engineer’s customer service unit
typically manages the installation’s facility manager program. They provide
initial and recurring training for facility managers, which covers facility
manager roles and responsibilities and identifies the processes and procedures
required for submitting work requests. </p>

<p class="msonormal107">13.34.3. The base civil engineer’s customer service unit
receives and reviews all incoming work requests for validity, verifies scope,
and ensures the work request is coordinated with the appropriate agencies such
as fire, safety, and environmental. If the work request is approved, it will be
executed in-house by the operations flight or as a contract managed by the
engineering flight. </p>

<p class="msonormal108">13.34.4. In-house work will either be direct
scheduled or planned. Direct scheduled work does not need detailed planning and
can be sent directly to the required shop for execution. An example of a direct
scheduled work is fixing a leaky faucet. Planned work is typically more complex
and requires detailed planning, scheduling of multiple shops, and lead time for
material acquisition. An example of planned work is relocating a doorway and
associated exit signs to accommodate the new layout. In-house work is
prioritized for execution based on impact to the overall mission and as labor,
materials, and funding become available. </p>

<p class="msonormal91">13.34.5. When work exceeds the scope or capability of the
operations flight, the work request will be classified as a project and sent to
the base civil engineer’s engineering flight where it will compete against
other projects for execution as a contract. </p>

<p class="msonormal109">13.34.6. The base civil engineer ensures changes to
real property are captured and updated in the real property inventory. The real
property inventory must be complete and up-to-date with source documentation
for audit purposes to support financial improvement and audit readiness. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.35. Planning and Programming Facility Projects: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">13.35.1. Planning refers to the identification of facility
work to satisfy current and future mission requirements. The base civil
engineer uses several methods to identify facility requirements including
annual space utilization surveys, biennial commander’s facility assessments,
environmental compliance status assessments, asset management plans, and user-
or occupant-identified requirements. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">13.35.2. During programming, the authority and resources
necessary to accomplish the planned work are acquired. After the requirements
are identified, the base civil engineer develops facility project proposals and
presents them to the installation commander for validation, prioritization, and
approval by the proper authority. A key element of programming facility
requirements is proper work classification. Work authorization, approval
levels, and fund sources vary with work classification. Real property
maintenance work is classified as maintenance, repair, or construction.
Operations and maintenance appropriation-funded unspecified minor military
construction projects may not exceed $1,000,000. The threshold for using
operation and maintenance funding for laboratory revitalization unspecified
minor military construction projects is $4,000,000.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.36. Real Property Records: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal22">13.36.1. Air Force leadership, Department of Defense, and
Congress utilize real property inventory to make planning, programming, and
budgeting decisions. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">13.36.2. The real property inventory forms an audit
trail that begins when a facility is constructed and includes all costs for any
alterations and improvements accomplished by military construction and minor
construction, to include self-help or government purchase card work. A complete
real property inventory consists of all sites, lands, and facilities for which
the Air Force has real property accountability, regardless of the organization
using or funding the facility or land. </p>

<p class="msonormal110">13.36.3. Any activity leading to real property inventory
additions, updates, or deletions must have proper approval documentation from
the base civil engineer and filed with the real property officer as directed.
In most instances these actions are accomplished by the civil engineer
squadron. However, when services are procured by government purchase card or
other means the facility manager will assist with accomplishing these actions. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.38.1. <b class="calibre1">Mobility Energy. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal23">The policy to reduce mobility energy will be assessed by
measuring actual petroleum consumption. Consumption will be measured in barrels
and include aircraft and vehicle operations. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">13.38.2. <b class="calibre1">Facility Energy. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal21">The policy to reduce facility energy will be assessed by
measuring utility consumption to include electricity, coal, natural gas,
petroleum, water, etc. Consumption will be measured in million British thermal
units per square foot (or gallons per square foot) and will include all
installation facilities except privatized housing and facilities meeting
Department of Energy exclusion requirements. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">13.39. Conclusion: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">13.39.1. With the constant emphasis on efficiency, the Air
Force must get the greatest return from every investment. The Air Force invests
in people and other resources, all of which must be managed wisely. This
chapter provided an overview of responsibilities and outlined a few of the many
Air Force management objectives. </p>

<p class="msonormal111">13.39.2. All supervisors, managers, and commanders
are responsible for safeguarding Air Force resources and exercising sound
resource management practices. Remember, the amount of money spent and the
other resources used (manpower, facilities) affect the entire mission. Leaders
have a daily role to play in the overall system. They must plan for future
requirements and ensure allocated resources are used properly. If correctly
accomplished, the result will be a stronger and more efficient Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre3"><i class="calibre4">Section 21B—Organizational Design
</i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre3">21.2. Introduction.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal5">What do you think of when you hear the term Organizational
Design? Do you think of your organizational chart? Most people do, but that is
only a portion of your organization's design. Organizational design is the
process of selecting a formal system of communication, coordination, controls,
authority, and assigned responsibilities necessary to achieve the
organization's goals. As leaders, we need to understand how to select
appropriate organizational designs that facilitate mission accomplishment. To
this end, this reading will address how effective organizational design not
only facilitates mission accomplishment but also enhances productivity of an
organization. First, we will discuss factors leaders should consider when
designing their organizations. Then, we will look at four organizational
systems or designs, and discuss the organizational factors which determine
which design is most appropriate for a given organization. Before we can talk
about the different designs, we need to look at what influences or factors
affect our design choice. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre3">21.3. Design Factors:</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal6">21.3.1. There are many factors that<b class="calibre3"> </b>influence how we set<b class="calibre3"> </b>up our organizations. The first is <b class="calibre3">organizational strategy (goals). </b>Professor
of Organizational Behavior Dr. Stephen Robbins states, "An organization's
strategy<b class="calibre3"> </b>is a means to help
management achieve its objectives. Since objectives are derived from the
organization's overall strategy,<b class="calibre3"> </b>it
is only logical that strategy and structure should be linked. More
specifically, structure should follow strategy." (Robbins: 569) What Dr.
Robbins suggests<b class="calibre3"> </b>is we<b class="calibre3"> </b>need to identify why we<b class="calibre3"> </b>are doing what we are doing, how we
expect<b class="calibre3"> </b>to get there (strategy), and
then design our organizations to accomplish that strategy. Why does your
organization exist?<b class="calibre3"> </b>What are your
goals?<b class="calibre3"> </b>Does your mission require
creativity or control? Do you need to be effective or efficient? Answers to
these questions give us a starting point in determining which design the
organization should use. Nevertheless, we must consider a few other factors. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">21.3.2. Another design factor is the <b class="calibre3">environment.</b> When we speak of the
environment, we are not talking about the climate or the physical environment.
We are talking about what outside forces affect the organization's processes.
Are we dependent on other organizations or sections to do our jobs? Is the
environment constantly in a state of flux? Are we continually changing or do we
do the same processes repeatedly? Professor Richard Daft, author of <i class="calibre4">Organizational Theory and Design, </i>calls
this the stableunstable dimension. "An environment's domain is stable if
it remains the same over a period of months or years. Under unstable conditions,
environmental elements shift abruptly." (Daft: 148) If our routine is
unstable, this means the environment is constantly changing, which requires
flexibility. If you can set your watch by it, as the cliché goes, then it is
stable and allows stricter control. Don't be fooled into thinking that once you
identify your environment as stable, it remains that way; it does not. We need
to continually scan our environment to identify outside changes that affect our
design. Certainly, you can see that the environment helps us determine which
design is most appropriate for our organization. Just like goals, the
environment works with other factors as well. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">21.3.3. The third factor to consider is the<b class="calibre3"> size</b> of your organization. Early in
your career, you learned the term <i class="calibre4">span of
control. </i>There are only so many people one person can effectively manage.
Once you reach a point where you lose effectiveness, new levels of management
must be developed and more structure introduced. Let's assume your whole
organization is a five-person shop. How many levels of supervision would you
need? Probably one. Now add two more workers. Do supervision levels increase?
No! How about adding 10, 20, or 100 people? Maybe as the organization grows, so
should the level of supervision. There comes a point where your structure
becomes so rigid that more workers would require few, if any, additional levels
of supervision.<b class="calibre3"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal8">21.3.4. The last factor we will discuss is <b class="calibre3">technology.</b> According to Professor
Daft, technology refers to the work processes, techniques, machines, and
actions used to transform organizational inputs (materials, information, ideas)
into outputs (products and services). (Daft: 266) We need to look at what resources
we use to accomplish our mission to also help determine the best design for our
organizations. If we primarily use new equipment with unknown procedures or
outcomes, we would need fewer controls and more flexibility than if we use
equipment that is old with known procedures and outcomes. In other words, if
the equipment you use is old and well known, more structure could be utilized.
If the equipment you use is newer, the outcomes or problems you may encounter
require flexibility. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">21.3.5. These four factors, strategy, environment, size,
and technology, all influence how we should design our organization. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">Let's shift our attention to four organizational systems
or designs we can use to improve unit effectiveness. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre3">21.4. Designs. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">21.4.1. The first design we will discuss is the <b class="calibre3">mechanistic design</b>. Sometimes referred
to as the bureaucratic structure, it is vertically structured; communication is
basically up and down rather than lateral. As Dr. Robbins puts it, "The
mechanistic model ... is synonymous with the bureaucracy in that it has
extensive departmentalization, high formalization, a limited information
network (mostly downward communication) and little participation by low-level
members in decision-making." (Robbins: 569) Departmentalization means
grouping our work tasks by specialty. The more specialized the tasks, the more
structure is used. By high formalization, we mean a heavy reliance on rules.
Let's look at the mechanistic system in the context of the factors discussed earlier.
The mechanistic system lends itself well to an organization where strategy or
goals are geared toward efficiency; tasks need to be accomplished quickly and
accurately. An environment which is quite stable requires little flexibility;
therefore, a rigid structure or mechanistic design should be used. If the size
of the organization is intermediate to large, more structure is necessary. As
discussed earlier, as organizations grow, new levels of supervision must be
added to maintain control. Finally, technology is known. What we use to do our
jobs is not new. We can predict day to day what will happen and we have
procedures to follow to accomplish our tasks. The mechanistic organization is
very efficient, and responds to decisions rapidly. Because of the vertical
communication, procedures flow from top to bottom rather quickly. This is very
effective for emergency services that rely on speed. The mechanistic design has
disadvantages as well. Because of the reliance on rules, job satisfaction
suffers because subordinates basically do as they are told with little to no
discussion. Limited discussion also leads to a poor social or human relations
environment as well. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">21.4.2. The <b class="calibre3">organic
design</b> is just the opposite of the mechanistic. This design has horizontal
specialization rather than vertical. According to Dr. Robbins, the organic
system is "... flat, uses cross-hierarchical and cross-functional teams,
has low formalization, possesses a comprehensive information network (utilizing
lateral and upward communication as well as downward), and it involves high
participation in decision-making." (Robbins: 569) Looking at an
organizational chart, you would not see much difference between the mechanistic
and the organic design. On the other hand, the interaction within the
organization is quite different. The organic organization has extensive
cross-communication. There is no clear line drawn for the communication path to
follow. As workers need to communicate with others, they do so, free of
bureaucratic lines. The organic system allows joint decision-making and
encourages subordinates to voice their opinions. Looking back at the factors,
the organic organization's strategy is geared toward innovativeness and
creativity. The computer software industry is a good example of one that
requires a creative rather than a restrictive system. The environment is
unstable; with change being the norm rather than the exception. Therefore, an
organic system is needed. The size should be small to moderate because this
type of organization requires loose rules. Technology is fairly new with
outcomes that are unknown, requiring adaptation rather than compliance. The
organic system lends itself well to research and development organizations that
are creative rather than restrictive. The strengths of an organic organization
lie within communication. The sharing of information and participative
environment increase worker satisfaction and often produce wellrounded
decisions. Unfortunately, the organic design's communication slows down the implementation
process. This slow response leads to low efficiency. In addition, the organic
organization's flexibility reduces standards. In other words, if the same task
is performed every three months, they may be handled differently each time. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">21.4.3. There are very few organizations that are
purely mechanistic or organic. For this reason, we have another design that
incorporates the strengths of both, the <b class="calibre3">diverse</b>
design. This design is used when the organization needs the rigid structure of
the mechanistic organization for one section and the flexibility of the organic
for another. For example, the administrative section has specific rules to
follow when processing performance reports, decorations, and orders. For this
purpose, they would require a mechanistic system. In the same organization, you
may have a section that conducts training. The mechanistic system would hinder
the creativity required for such a section; therefore, an organic system would
be more effective. Because the organization uses both mechanistic and organic
systems to accomplish the mission, the organizational design is considered
diverse. The diverse organization incorporates the best of both designs to
accomplish the mission. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">21.4.4. The last design we will look at is the <b class="calibre3">matrix design</b>. Basically, developing a
matrix is teaming workers from different sections or organizations together to
solve problems or serve a function. We do this quite often. The disaster
preparedness section, mobility section, and process action teams are good
examples of a matrix. The distinguishing factor in a matrix is the chain of
command. In the matrix design, subordinates have two bosses. They have their
functional boss, who writes their performance report and schedules normal duty
hours, and the project boss or team leader. The strength of the matrix design
lies in the pooling of expertise and resources, and the weaknesses lie in the
confusion of who is in charge; the functional or project boss. One note of
caution; the matrix is not a design in itself. Basically the matrix is a design
within a design. In other words, an organization designed mechanistically that
develops a Process Action Team to work a project does not become a matrix.
Actually, they are a mechanistic organization with a matrix. A matrix is
usually short-lived, so the overall organizational structure remains intact. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">21.4.5. As managers in today's Air Force, your job
is to ensure organizations are operating at peak performance. One way of
accomplishing that responsibility is to set up organizations effectively. We
need to look at our units from the standpoint of our organizational strategy;
the environment or an outside influence on our organization, the size of our
organization, and the technology or advances in the equipment we use day to
day. Once we understand how these factors relate to our organization, we can
decide what structure would best accomplish our mission. Is the organization
geared toward the rigid mechanistic structure, the flexible organic structure,
a combination (the diverse structure), or do we need to use specialized teams
to solve a problem as in the matrix structure? These are decisions made by the
effective leader. By designing our organizations properly, we are designing the
organization that will capitalize on strengths and minimize weaknesses. As you
can see, organizational design goes much further than the organizational chart.

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre3"><i class="calibre4">Section 21C—Managing
Organizational Change </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre3">21.5. Introduction. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">The British created a civil service job in 1803 requiring
a man stand on the White Cliffs of Dover with a spyglass. He was supposed to
ring a bell if he saw Napoleon coming. Despite Napoleon’s defeat in 1813, the
job existed until 1945. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">21.5.1. What’s wrong with this picture? The
scenario illustrates an improvement, not to mention a significant cost-saving
opportunity that was ignored for over 130 years! We know change is inevitable.
We know changes are taking place every day, all around us. We know change is
easy, right? Wrong! As the scenario above shows, change is not automatic and
doesn’t just happen. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">21.5.2. Change can be a complicated and often
painful process. Senior enlisted leaders are in key positions to manage change.
They have the authority and responsibility to lead and manage organizations,
many years of experience, and technical proficiency. However, as leaders, they
must also become proficient organizational change managers. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">21.5.3. This section explores the change process using the
model proposed by renowned social psychologist Kurt Lewin, who recommended
leaders view change as a three-stage process: unfreezing, changing, and
refreezing. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre3">21.6. Stage 1:
Unfreezing. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal14">Leaders begin organizational change by unfreezing,
which means going where the hurt is—where people feel the pain of poor policies
or systems. Organizational change is defined as the adoption of a new idea or
behavior by an organization (Daft, 452); the establishment of new norms. These
norms can be grouped in various categories, including technology, tasks,
structure, and people norms: (1) technology:<b class="calibre3"><i class="calibre4"> </i></b>computers, test
equipment, weapons systems, etc.; (2) tasks: general procedures, job steps,
checklists, etc.; (3) structure: administrative procedures, evaluation systems,
etc.; and (4) people:<span class="calibre2">  </span>technical or
leadership training, new jobs, etc. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">21.6.1. Regardless of what specifically needs to
change, the first step is to recognize the need for change and this step is far
from easy. Change is appropriate when there is a perceived gap between what the
norms are and what they should be. This perception starts the momentum to begin
unfreezing. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">21.6.2. Unfreezing is a deliberate management
activity to prepare people for change. Leaders create an environment where
people feel the need for change. This is often the most neglected, yet
essential part of unfreezing. A key factor in unfreezing involves making people
knowledgeable about the importance of a change and how it will affect their
jobs. Leaders must first generate a need in the people who will feel the
greatest effect of the change. They do this by pointing out the problems or
challenges with current operations. In many cases, people will want to stick to
the old norms. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">21.6.3. The first reaction to change is usually
resistance. Just as change is inevitable, so is resistance to change. An
essential element for successful change is having a good plan. Planning enables
the change agent to anticipate problems, develop courses of action, and deal
with resistance. Resistance can take many forms. Four of the most common are: </p>

<p class="msonormal18">21.6.3.1. <b class="calibre3">Uncertainty.</b>
When faced with impending change, people often experience fear of the unknown,
or see the change as a threat to their security: Can I do the new job? Can I
operate the new equipment? Will I still have a job? </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.6.3.2. <b class="calibre3">Self-interest.</b>
People often consider the power they currently have or their role in the
existing environment and question the possible loss of power after the change
is implemented. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.6.3.3. <b class="calibre3">Different
Perception/No Felt Need to Change.</b> Even if you think people recognize the
need for change, they may see the situation differently. Outwardly, they may
support the change, but inwardly, they resist it. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.6.3.4. <b class="calibre3">Over-Determination.</b>
Ironically, organization structure may be a barrier to change. For example, a
mechanistic structure that relies on strict procedure and lines of authority
may be so rigid that it inhibits change.<span class="calibre2"> 
</span></p>

<p class="msonormal20"><span class="calibre2"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal14">21.6.4. When making change, success depends on
managing and reducing resistance, and a change agent becomes vitally important.
Leaders must accept the role of change agent in order to manage change. Senior
enlisted leaders have vast influence on their subordinates, peers, and
superiors. Commanders and directors often call upon senior noncommissioned
officers to change an organization, to “make it happen.” Here are five proven
methods leaders employ to reduce and manage resistance to change: </p>

<p class="msonormal21">21.6.4.1. <b class="calibre3">Education
and Communication.</b> Educating people about the need for, and expected
results of, a change should reduce their resistance. Open communication is
necessary throughout the change process and helps reduce uncertainty. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">21.6.4.2. <b class="calibre3">Participation
and Involvement. </b>Leaders reduce resistance by actively involving those
affected in designing and implementing change. Involving people in the process
may be time-consuming, but should help commit them to the new program. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.6.4.3. <b class="calibre3">Facilitation
and Support.</b> Introduce the change gradually, if possible. Provide
additional training if needed. Reinforce and encourage people as much as
possible. Remember the power of high expectations. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.6.4.4. <b class="calibre3">Negotiation
and Agreement.</b> Offer incentives to those who continue to resist the change.
Negotiated agreements can help remind everyone of the changes they agreed upon
should resistance return. </p>

<p class="msonormal23">21.6.4.5. <b class="calibre3">Coercion.</b>
This technique involves using force to get people to accept change. This is a
last resort because compulsion negatively affects attitudes, and has long-term
negative consequences. Coerced compliance requires constant leadership
oversight to ensure the change remains in effect. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">21.6.5. There are usually many factors to consider,
whether maintaining current norms (the status quo) or changing current norms.
The change agent must analyze restraining (opposing) forces and devise ways to
reduce them to overcome resistance. At the same time, leaders must recognize
and strengthen driving (supporting) forces—those forces pushing toward change.
After analyzing the forces for and against change and developing a strategy to
deal with them, leaders can attend to the change itself. Leaders improve the
chance of success when they break the change into sequential steps. This
approach provides visible success early, which may encourage people to support
the rest of the change program. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">21.6.6. The unfreezing stage should be addressed
whenever change is imminent. Careful planning is an essential element of
unfreezing, improving chances of success and decreasing the likelihood of
having to repeat the unfreezing stage. Your plan should include a set of
evaluation standards to measure the degree of success or failure of the change.
An evaluation with clear goals and objectives can help assess the success of
change and help determine appropriate rewards when the change has been
completed. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre3">21.7. Stage 2:
Changing.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal13">This stage involves modifying technology, tasks,
structure, or distribution of people. This is the movement from the old state,
or the previous norms, to the new state. During the changing stage, the
organization installs new equipment, restructures work centers, or implements a
new performance appraisal system. In short, changing is anything that alters
the status quo. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">21.7.1. Your role as change agent in this stage is
to monitor the change as it occurs and pay close attention to the people most
affected by it. If you’ve implemented the change too early, you’ll know it by
watching the people’s reactions. If some link in the system isn’t ready to
handle the change, production may bog down. A few irate callers from other
branches or units will let you know in a hurry! </p>

<p class="msonormal17">21.7.2. In this stage, ensure the plan unfolds as
intended. Even the best plans go awry for one reason or another. Remember, the
importance of you being involved as the change is implemented and be ready to
deal with problems that may arise. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">21.7.3. Provide support at this stage. Some people
may be traumatized by the actual implementation, so you should provide
encouragement and advice as needed. The same techniques used to overcome
resistance to change (paragraph 21.6.4) apply here, too. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">21.7.4. Go back to the unfreezing stage if the
change isn’t going well. Going back or regrouping is better than pressing on
with a change that causes more problems than it fixes. The change agent must
decide whether (and when) to move forward. You must keep tabs on things or you
won’t be in a position to make this decision. Don’t just plan to change, flip
the switch, and let the chips fall where they may. </p>

<p class="msonormal25"><b class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2"> </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal26"><b class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2"> </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2"> </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre3">21.8. Stage 3:
Refreezing. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">The final stage in the change process is
refreezing. Just because you implemented a change and it appears to be going
smoothly doesn’t mean the job is done. You must lock in (or refreeze) the
desired outcomes and the new norms so they become permanent. </p>

<p class="msonormal29">21.8.1. Without refreezing, people often return to
the old ways. Consider an Airman who completes 7-skill level upgrade training
and learns the proper way to perform key tasks in his or her work center. The
proper way may differ from the way the work center completes the tasks. The
Airman may be inclined to conform to the old way rather than make waves:<span class="calibre2">  </span>old behaviors take over and nothing changes.
Actively encouraging the use of new techniques and reinforcing them encourages
others to use them, essentially freezing the new behavior. A critical step in
refreezing is evaluating results. Did the change have the desired effect? If
so, press on. If not, the new process may need more support, instruction,
training, time, etc. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">21.8.2. Having developed strategies to evaluate
results in Stage 1 of the change process, now is time to implement them. Positively
reinforcing desired outcomes is crucial. Reward people when they do something
right; this strengthens the correct behaviors and helps freeze them into place.
In many cases, the change agent can call attention to the success of the change
and show where it works. Highlighting successful change helps remove lingering
resistance and prevents people from returning to the old way of doing things. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">21.8.3. In some cases, even what appears to be
successful change management fails in the end. Years ago, a company bought new
computer equipment for the typing pool, replacing the old electric typewriters
with word processing stations. The new technology included color monitors,
advanced software, and high-speed printers. Everyone was carefully trained. The
new equipment was installed for half the typists at first, then the other half
got their new equipment, and the supervisors (change agents) provided support
and encouragement all the way. Soon the section was turning out professional
correspondence in half the time it previously took. Successful change, you say.
Unfortunately, it wasn’t. To cut down on the noise from the printers, portable
dividers were installed between workstations. This isolated the typists from
coworkers, who used to be able to converse back and forth unimpeded. As a
result, the previous social system, which was one of harmony, turned into one
of unhappy isolation. Both the people and the work suffered, and the change
plan had to be modified. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">21.8.4. Do you think the change agents anticipated
this outcome and planned for it? Probably not, but they really weren’t at
fault. After all, no one can anticipate everything. The example serves to
remind us of the importance of refreezing. The change agent must evaluate
results, reinforce the desired outcomes, and make constructive modifications as
needed. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">21.8.5. A change agent has a tough job. Carefully
planning change; however, can make it as painless as possible. Managing change
is one of the most important responsibilities you have. Using this three-stage
process can help you manage the inevitable changes, rather than letting the
changes manage you. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre3"><i class="calibre4">Section 21D—Conflict Management</i></b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre3">21.9. Introduction.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal31">Conflict is inevitable in every organization, and
is often necessary to reach high levels of performance. Dr. Kenneth Thomas,
author of <i class="calibre4">Conflict and Conflict
Management, the Handbook of Industrial and Organization Psychology </i>(1976),
defines conflict as the “process that results when one person (or a group)
perceives that another person or group is frustrating, or about to frustrate,
an important concern.” Conflict involves incompatible differences between
parties that result in interference or opposition. Such differences can
motivate for positive change or decrease productivity. </p>

<p class="msonormal32">21.9.1. <b class="calibre3">Destructive
Versus Constructive Conflict. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal33">Conflict can be constructive or destructive and
becomes destructive when it results in “barriers” to cooperation and
communication. This destroys morale and diverts energy away from important
tasks and initiatives. On the other hand, conflict can be constructive when
managed effectively. Positive conflict results in problem solutions, greater
understanding, and enhanced communication between individuals or groups. In the
past, managers were trained to avoid conflict because of its negative
repercussions. This continues to challenge managers today as they work
feverishly to avoid it altogether. However, managing conflict effectively
offers benefits to the organization like reducing organizational chaos and
stimulating work activity and productivity. Therefore, to manage conflict
successfully, we must first understand some of the sources of conflict. </p>

<p class="msonormal34">21.9.2.<b class="calibre3"> Sources of Conflict.
</b></p>

<p class="msonormal35">Many factors may result in or increase the
probability of conflict within an organization. These factors manifest
themselves in combination with other factors, making it potentially difficult
to identify the specific source of the conflict. Many researchers, however,
agree that conflict originates with one or more of the following stimulants: </p>

<p class="msonormal22">21.9.2.1. <b class="calibre3">Communication
Factors<i class="calibre4">. </i></b>We often hear that many
problems occur due to a failure in, or a lack of, communication. However, on
closer examination, this usually accounts for a very small portion of the
conflicts reported. The real crux of the problem is miscommunication; for
example, when communication is misinterpreted, inaccurate, or incomplete. For
personnel to perform at their very best, they need constructive,
comprehensible, and accurate information; anything less results in frustration,
stress, and failure. Remember, conflict is defined as frustration of an
important concern, whether real or perceived. Consider your organization and
the conflicts that erupted because of poor communication. Now consider what
happens when the communication process fails altogether. Did the outcomes
result in conflict? </p>

<p class="msonormal36">21.9.2.2. <b class="calibre3">Structural
Factors:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal37">21.9.2.2.1. <b class="calibre3">Size.
</b>Research shows that organizational size affects the people who work there.
Like an elevator that reaches its maximum capacity, the larger the
organization, the more people there is to cause and participate in conflict.
With more personnel comes more opinions, perspectives, perceptions, etc. As a
result, larger organizations may have unclear goals, more rigid structures,
increased specialization, more levels of supervision, and increased
opportunities for information to become distorted as it passes through each
organizational echelon. </p>

<p class="msonormal36">21.9.2.2.2. <b class="calibre3">Participation:</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal18">21.9.2.2.2.1. The more people interact and
participate, the more noticeable their differences become. This can also lead
to disputes and conflict, partly because although people may attempt to
participate does not necessarily mean their ideas are heard or accepted. This
rejection can spark frustration and conflict among members. However, this
situation also has the potential to increase productivity if workers become
more creative or competitive and search for better ways to enhance overall unit
performance. This is productive conflict versus destructive conflict. </p>

<p class="msonormal38">21.9.2.2.2.2. We want people to challenge the
status quo, to seek better ways to do business, and to continually improve
processes. This supports our core value, <i class="calibre4">excellence
in all we do. </i>Such efforts also support our <i class="calibre4">service before self </i>core value, in that we must be willing to set
aside old ways and personal differences in order to listen to the ideas of
others, to include our newest Airman. We must be willing to change, put
self-interests aside, and do what is right for the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">21.9.2.3. <b class="calibre3">Line-Staff
Distinctions. </b>Diverse backgrounds and roles can create conflict. According
to Dr. Thomas, this is very noticeable in the line and staff functions because
the roles are so different. Overall, line personnel are concerned with
production and are usually more loyal to the company. Staff functions usually
involve creativity; therefore, staff personnel are usually more critical of the
organization. Moreover, since there are usually different requirements for
staff and line functions, there are different types of backgrounds for each.
These differences in values, training, background, etc., can lead to conflict.
Consider how line and staff personnel view organizational goals. Line personnel
normally are more concerned with the immediate or short-range goals, whereas
staff personnel are more concerned with long-range or strategic goals. These
differences in background and viewpoints can trigger conflict. </p>

<p class="msonormal37">21.9.2.4. <b class="calibre3">Rewards.
</b>Earning rewards involves a level of competition, which can lead to
conflict. Healthy competition is not the problem. However, the individuals and
groups who perceive that the rewards were given unfairly or in favor of someone
else can often lead to conflict. For example, one person or department receives
recognition that others feel they deserved but did not receive. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">21.9.2.5. <b class="calibre3">Resource
Interdependence.</b> Most likely, we have all had to compete for resources at
one time or another. When people compete for scarce resources and each party
feels they have a greater need, conflict may arise. Oftentimes, negotiations
fail as each party assumes a directive, or authoritarian position as they
compete for the resource. </p>

<p class="msonormal34">21.9.3.<b class="calibre3"> Personal
Behavior Factors. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal39">Conflict can arise because of individual differences,
such as goals and objectives, perceptions, values, and personalities. Three
such differences, in particular, may facilitate behaviors that cause conflict:
values, perception, and personality. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">21.9.3.1. <b class="calibre3">Values.<i class="calibre4"> </i></b>Values are very important to people
and will determine their behavior. When people’s values are questioned,
criticized, or opposed, conflict can result. Some values, such as religion and
politics, seem to incite the biggest arguments and can lead to fights, but even
less emotion-based values can cause conflict. For example, a worker who values
high quality work may see him or herself due a reward for the quality of the
work. Conflict may occur if the unit emphasizes quantity over quality and
rewards someone else instead. </p>

<p class="msonormal41">21.9.3.2. <b class="calibre3">Perception.</b>
Values also affect how people perceive situations and other people. If a person
perceives others as lazy and incompetent, how he or she responds to that
perception may cause problems. A person’s perception of what constitutes
fairness, quality of work, or constructive techniques can lead to conflict if
these perceptions differ significantly from others or what the organization has
defined for those factors. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">21.9.3.3. <b class="calibre3">Personality.</b>
We have all heard about people who couldn’t get along because of a personality
conflict and this isn’t uncommon. Put certain personalities together and you
are asking for conflict. Two personality types especially conflict-prone are
the highly authoritarian individual and the low self-esteem individual. The
highly authoritarian personality may antagonize coworkers by escalating
otherwise trivial differences. The low selfesteem personality may feel
threatened by others and therefore overreact. Either type of behavior can
create interpersonal conflict in an organization. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre3">21.10. Five Styles of
Conflict Management: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal15">21.10.1. Now that we have an idea of what conflict
is and what causes it, we can examine some ways to manage it. In the book, “<i class="calibre4"><span class="calibre6">Conflict and
Negotiation Processes in Organizations,</span>” Handbook of Industrial and
Organizational Psychology </i>(1992),<i class="calibre4"> </i>Dr.
Thomas suggests five major conflict management styles: competing (or forcing),
collaborating, accommodating, avoiding, and compromising. Dr. Thomas uses a
two-dimensional framework to compare these styles. The first dimension refers
to the degree of cooperation a manager exhibits, measuring from uncooperative
to cooperative. The second dimension measures assertiveness on a scale from
nonassertive (passive) to assertive (active). Being cooperative refers to how
willing a person or group is to satisfy the other’s needs. For example, if
Person A gives into the needs of Person B, Person A is considered cooperative.
If Person A assumes a “my way or the highway” approach, he or she is considered
uncooperative. </p>

<p class="msonormal29">21.10.2. From these two dimensions, we can devise a
way to manage conflict based on the situation. Just as situational leadership
is based on task and relationship behavior, conflict management is situational
and is based on assertive and cooperative behavior. With this in mind, let’s
look at the five styles used to manage conflict. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.10.2.1. <b class="calibre3">Competing
(or Forcing).<i class="calibre4"> </i></b>This style attempts
to overwhelm an opponent with formal authority, threats, or the use of power.
Its underlying features are being highly assertive and uncooperative. </p>

<p class="msonormal42">21.10.2.2. <b class="calibre3">Collaborating.<i class="calibre4"> </i></b>The collaborating style involves an
attempt to satisfy the concerns of both sides through honest discussion.
Creative approaches to conflict reduction, such as sharing resources, may
actually lead to both parties being materially better off. For this style to be
successful, trust and openness are required of all participants. This style is
high in assertive behavior and high in cooperation and seeks a win position for
both groups. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.10.2.3. <b class="calibre3">Accommodating.
</b>The accommodating style combines low assertiveness and high cooperation. At
the simplest level, this style may merely involve giving in to another person’s
wishes. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.10.2.4. <b class="calibre3">Avoiding:<i class="calibre4"> </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal37">21.10.2.4.1. The combination of low assertiveness
and low cooperation leads to an avoiding style. The person implies that he or
she will appear to be neutral and it may not always be possible to adopt a
truly neutral position, but a manager may nonetheless prefer to avoid the
situation. Although a manager who avoids difficult issues is likely to be
resented by his or her Airmen, this strategy may be effective under certain
circumstances. For example, a manager may initially stay out of a disagreement
to avoid escalating the conflict during a particular phase of development.
Later, when he or she judges the time is right, the manager may take a more
active role in finding a productive solution. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">21.10.2.4.2. Experienced managers recognize that
action is not always necessary because some problems dissipate over time or are
resolved by other organizational processes. For example, an intense conflict
between two Airmen may seem to require intervention by their manager. If the
manager knows that one of the individuals will soon be transferred to another
department or promoted to another position, ignoring the situation and letting
the impending changes resolve the difficulty may be the best solution. </p>

<p class="msonormal43">21.10.2.5. <b class="calibre3">Compromising.
</b>This style involves intermediate degrees of assertiveness and cooperation
to partially satisfy both parties’ desires and achieve a middle ground. To
successfully compromise, both parties must be willing to give up something.
Compromising is common during labor and management disputes. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre3">21.11. Applying
Conflict Management Style: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal14">21.11.1.<b class="calibre3"> </b>When
deciding which style of conflict management to use, consider a few additional
factors. First, consider who you are dealing with. When dealing with a
supervisor or a peer, the competing style of conflict management may not be
applicable. Also, doubtful any of us could force our commander in a conflict
situation. On the other hand, competing may work for a subordinate. You have
the legitimate power to enforce a policy. So knowing <b class="calibre3"><i class="calibre4">who </i></b>is important in
deciding the style you can use. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">21.11.2. Another factor is determining how critical
the issue is, also known as the <b class="calibre3"><i class="calibre4">stakes</i></b>. If the issue is critical,
you may wish to use the avoiding style at first to carefully consider the options
or gather more data. However, because the issue is critical, you cannot avoid
it for long. Sooner or later, you will have to confront the issue. Also, if the
situation is critical and you know you are right, you may need to use the
competing style to force your position. Conversely, if the issue is trivial,
you could avoid it or even accommodate the other party. Remember to always
consider the <b class="calibre3"><i class="calibre4">stakes </i></b>in the issue. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">21.11.3. The final factor is the <b class="calibre3"><i class="calibre4">situation
</i></b>itself. In an emergency, the competing style might be necessary because
there simply is not enough time to collaborate or compromise. You also cannot
avoid an emergency. However, if time is not an issue and the parties are
willing to discuss the matter, collaboration may be the best way to deal with
the conflict situation because it works best for everyone. </p>

<p class="msonormal44">21.11.4. Although people may consider some styles
of conflict management more effective (for example, collaborating versus
avoiding), all of the conflict management styles are useful, depending on who,
the stakes, and the situation. Using these five styles allows us to
successfully manage conflict, reduce disorder and chaos, and facilitate
creativity and innovative problem solving. Being a conflict management
specialist<i class="calibre4"> </i>is just another one of the
many responsibilities of managers! </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre3"><i class="calibre4">Section 21E—Problem Solving </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre3">21.12. Overview. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal12">The use of Continuous Process Improvement (CPI)
increases operational capabilities while reducing associated costs by applying
proven methodologies to all processes associated with fulfilling the Air Force
mission. Continuous Process Improvement is a comprehensive philosophy of
operations built around the concepts that there are always ways a process can
be improved to better meet mission/customer requirements; organizations must
constantly strive to make those improvements based on performance metrics that
align to strategic objectives; and efficiencies should be replicated to the
extent practical. Continuous Process Improvement is a hallmark of highly
successful organizations and a major graded area in Air Force Inspection System
(AFI 90-201, <i class="calibre4">Air Force Inspection System</i>)
and a commander responsibility in AFI 1-2, <i class="calibre4">Commander’s

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre3">21.13.</b> <b class="calibre3">Continuous Process Improvement uses
Structured Problem Solving. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">The core of Air Force process improvement is the Practical
Problem Solving Method. The Practical Problem Solving </p>

<p class="msonormal29">Method is a standardized and structured approach to
problem solving utilized in commercial industry and adopted by the Air Force.
The Practical Problem Solving Method is an 8-step process used to clarify
problems, identify root causes, and develop appropriate countermeasures to
achieve change. Typically, the Practical Problem Solving Method is illustrated
using the A3 format. <i class="calibre4"><span class="calibre2"> </span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre3">21.14.</b> <b class="calibre3">Identifying Improvement Opportunities.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal15">Oftentimes the success of an organization relies on
its ability to identify opportunities for process improvement. Much like
industry partners, the Air Force must strive for continuous process
improvement. Customer demand, processing, budgeting, and work force needs are
all factors organizations have to effectively manage to survive. The Air Force
contends with the same issues as global operations continue: readiness,
training, and modernization have to be managed with less monetary freedom. The
application of Practical Problem Solving Method provides a methodical approach
to identifying opportunities for improvements through all process within the
Air Force. Consistently applied, the Practical Problem Solving Method provides
an excellent tool to make data-driven decisions with regards to management,
process change, and the sharing of best practices.<span class="calibre2">   </span></p>

<p class="msonormal15">21.14.1. <b class="calibre3">Strategic
Alignment. </b>Strategic alignment provides the framework to ensure resources
and actions of subordinate levels align to and achieve the strategy, mission,
vision, priorities, and objectives of the enterprise. The Strategic Plan
identifies the current mission, vision for the future, and prioritizes
objectives to get from the current state to the future vision. The Strategic
Plan also communicates Commander’s intent and assigns responsibility.
Imperative is that all improvement efforts align with the organization’s
efforts to accomplish the overall Strategic Plan’s objectives. AFI 1-2, <i class="calibre4">Commander’s Responsibilities,</i> requires

<p class="msonormal50">21.15.1.1.<span class="calibre20"> </span>The critical first step to effective
problemsolving is to clearly understand the problem. A problem solving effort
that begins with “We all know what the problem is, so just get it fixed now?”
sets us up for failure before we begin. This “fly by the seat of your pants
approach” leads to several errors. First, because the “obvious solution” is
often based purely on the experience level of the problem solver, which
misdiagnose the underlying problem. Secondly, this mindset is closed to the
possibility of innovative solutions which are better suited to solving the real
problem. A well-defined problem statement uses data to identify where the
problem is occurring and impact of the problem, and compares performance
against a standard with scope and direction. The statement does not make </p>

<p class="msonormal19">assumptions of a root cause, solution and/or
countermeasure and includes visual tools to depict the current state. </p>

<p class="msonormal37">21.15.1.2. The Who, What, When, Where, and
significance of the problem statement should be validated by data. This is done
by collecting and analyzing data to both validate the existence and magnitude
of the problem. If data does not exist, the effort should be paused to collect
and analyze the needed data <i class="calibre4">before</i>
moving forward. Tools to consider for Step 1 are Strategic Alignment; Voice of
the Customer; Supplier, Input, Process, Output, Customer Diagram; and Value
Stream map. </p>

<p class="msonormal34">21.15.2.<b class="calibre3"> Step 2—Break
Down Problem and Identify Performance Gaps: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal40">21.15.2.1. Once the problem has been clearly
identified and answers the Who, What, When, and Where of the problem statement,
efforts are made to further analyze the data in comparison to the voice of the
customer. The voice of the customer gives the standard to measure from. The
delta between the current state (otherwise known as the voice of the process)
and voice of the customer will highlight opportunities for improvements (also
called the performance gap). Often, the more thorough the evaluation of a
problem in this step, the more effective and concise the Practical Problem Solving
Method will be.<span class="calibre2">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal18">21.15.2.2.<b class="calibre3"> </b>A
critical step in assessing a problem is gathering and reviewing data on the
process. Understanding what appropriate data is required and the ability to
interpret that data is paramount to performance gap analysis. Step 2
effectively frames and supports the problem in Step 1 using data. Tools to
consider for Step 2 are “Go &amp; See” and metrics that help better define the
gap between the voice of the customer and voice of the process.<span class="calibre2">    </span></p>

<p class="msonormal34">21.15.3.<b class="calibre3"> Step 3—Set
Improvement Targets: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal38">21.15.3.1. Air Force leaders establish a vision of
what an organization will strive to become (the Ideal State). In Step 3,
process owners and/or project sponsors set improvement targets based on voice
of the customer and strategic goals and objectives. Targets help define the
required performance levels to achieve the vision. Targets should be
challenging but achievable and have certain characteristics: Specific,
Measurable, Attainable, Resultsfocused, and Time-bound (SMART). The project
should obtain a vector check upon completion to ensure strategic alignment with
the project champion. Tools to consider for Step 3 are Ideal State Map, SMART
objectives, setting goals. </p>

<p class="msonormal36">21.15.3.2. <b class="calibre3">SMART
Objectives are:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal38">21.15.3.2.1. <b class="calibre3">Specific:
</b>Have desirable outputs based on subject matter expert knowledge and
experience applicable to the process improvement activity. Specific targets
should answer who is involved, what is to accomplish, where it is to be done,
when it is to be done (time frame), which (Identify requirements and
constraints) and why (Specific reasons, purpose or benefits of accomplishing
the goal).<span class="calibre2">   </span></p>

<p class="msonormal23">21.15.3.2.2. <b class="calibre3">Measurable:</b>
Include time frames and data obtainable from specific sources. Establish
criteria for measuring progress toward the attainment of each goal. To
determine if your goal is measurable, ask questions such as......How much? How
many? How will I know when it is accomplished?<span class="calibre2"> 
</span></p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.15.3.2.3. <b class="calibre3">Attainable:
</b>Resources are available; may have some risk, but success is possible. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.15.3.2.4. <b class="calibre3">Results-Focused:
</b>The mission, vision, and goals are linked and meaningful to the user. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.15.3.2.5. <b class="calibre3">Time-bound:
</b>Provide date for completion. Targeted dates provide measurable
accountability.<span class="calibre2">    </span></p>

<p class="msonormal34">21.15.4.<b class="calibre3"> Step
4—Determine Root Cause. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">Air Force leaders often find themselves addressing
problems which have been “solved” many times because previous problem-solving
efforts were directed at <i class="calibre4">symptoms </i>of
a problem rather than the <i class="calibre4">root cause</i>
of the problem. If an aircraft is constantly breaking down and cannot perform
its mission, should the goal be to reduce aircraft usage, improve repair cycle
time, improve the quality of replacement parts, improve the aircraft design, or
improve the aircraft design process? Each step becomes increasingly difficult
to evaluate, but each step also has a greater impact in the elimination of the
problem. Root cause analysis is a tradeoff between digging as deeply as
possible and finding the deepest point still within the team’s sphere of
influence. The correct root cause should be validated by using the same data
used to define the problem in Step 1. Tools to consider for Step 4 are 5 Whys,
brainstorming, Pareto Chart, Affinity diagram, fishbone diagram, and control
charts. </p>

<p class="msonormal34">21.15.5.<b class="calibre3"> Step
5—Develop Countermeasures: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal38">21.15.5.1. Step 5 is where process changes that
directly corrects, influences, affects each of your root causes are developed.
Air Force leaders should follow important guidelines to ensure the greatest
likelihood of success. A key principle to remember is that the impact of a
solution is a combination of the quality of the solution and the acceptance of
the solution by the people who must implement it. The relationship is similar
to the following formula: (Quality of the solution) x (Acceptance) = Impact.
Also, when developing countermeasures strive for process improvement change
that is sustainable and repeatable. </p>

<p class="msonormal33">21.15.5.2. Address potential root causes with
countermeasures which conform to lean principles and are the most practical and
effective, “keep it simple.” Validate countermeasures will close performance
gaps when implemented. Countermeasures should move the organization closer to
the ideal state and support strategic plans. Also recommended is to build
consensus, when possible and appropriate, with all stakeholders involved. <span class="calibre2"> </span>Judiciously involving stakeholders in the
development of countermeasures sponsors ownership of the solution and its
success. At the end of this step, obtain a vector check from the champion to
ensure strategic alignment.<span class="calibre2">  </span>The champion
approves the countermeasures prior to implementation. Tools to consider for
Step 5 are Sort, Straighten, Shine, Standardize, Sustain; brainstorming;
multi-voting; Possible, Implement, Challenge, Kill Chart; errorproofing;
standard work; cell/flow design; and Future State Map. </p>

<p class="msonormal34">21.15.6.<b class="calibre3"> Step 6—See
Countermeasures Through. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal38">Step 6 is seeing countermeasures through execution
and tracking of detailed implementation plans for each countermeasure approved
in Block 5 of the Practical Problem Solving Method. The champion should be
updated regularly on all tasks status until countermeasures have been
implemented or deemed unnecessary as target state has been met. Devoting time
and resources towards developing an action plan without action should be
considered waste. Tools to consider for Step 6 are Sort, Straighten, Shine,
Standardize, Sustain; visual management, standard work, cell/flow design,
variation reduction, error-proofing, quick changeover, and the rapid
improvement event. </p>

<p class="msonormal34">21.15.7.<b class="calibre3"> Step
7—Confirm Results and Process: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal40">21.15.7.1. Step 7 compares the results of
implemented countermeasures to the identified performance gaps and improvement
targets. Verify the improved process is sustainable and repeatable. Results are
measured by data and analyzed to confirm the project’s intent. Illustrate
confirmed results with appropriate data tool(s) which link back to performance
gap(s) in Step 2 and improvement target(s) in Step 3. Tools to consider during
step 7 are key performance indicators/metrics and strategic alignment.<span class="calibre2">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.15.7.2. Processes should be monitored for: </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.15.7.2.1. Performance relative to the baseline
developed in Steps 1 and 2. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.15.7.2.2. Performance relative to SMART targets
established in Step 3. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.15.7.2.3. Performance relative to the solution
implementation. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.15.7.2.4. If you are not meeting targets, you may need
to return to Step 4. Incorrect root-cause determination is the most common
mistake made during continuous process improvement efforts. </p>

<p class="msonormal34">21.15.8.<b class="calibre3"> Step
8—Standardize Successful Processes: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal40">21.15.8.1. Step 8 is the most commonly skipped and
under-completed step of the entire Practical Problem Solving Method. Some
people are tempted to take newfound knowledge and skills and immediately move
on to the next improvement initiative, skipping the effort to ensure the
results are codified. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.15.8.2. This step is defined by answers to three
questions: </p>

<p class="msonormal22">21.15.8.2.1. <b class="calibre3">What
is needed to standardize the improvements?</b> This could be Airmen Powered by
Innovation (API) program input, changes to technical orders, Air Force
instructions, operating instructions, equipment materiel, or using a different
vendor or supplier. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">21.15.8.2.2. <b class="calibre3">How
should improvements and lessons learned be communicated?</b> This could be
accomplished through input into Air Force CPI Portal, key meetings, Air Force
publications, Public Affairs, chain of command, or SharePoint sites. Leaders
should ensure the Wing Process Manager is aware of the success. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.15.8.2.3. <b class="calibre3">Were
other opportunities or problems identified by the problem-solving model?</b>
This project may have identified additional problem-solving opportunities. </p>

<p class="msonormal38">21.15.8.3. Effective problem solving should follow
the Practical Problem Solving Method. Attempting to skip, reorder, or shortcut
steps invariably leads to suboptimal solutions or failure. Following the
Practical Problem Solving Method ensures actions lead to the desired results
with minimal waste. It also ensures the results are aligned with the needs of
the organization. Properly applied, the Practical Problem Solving Method is aligned
to the organization’s purpose and activities and increases Air Force combat
effectiveness. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">21.15.9.<b class="calibre3">
Methodologies. </b>Air Force CPI incorporates aspects of four major CPI
methodologies. A Practical Problem Solving Method solution may simultaneously
draw from more than one of the CPI methods. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">21.15.9.1.<b class="calibre3">
Lean.</b> A methodology focused on work flow, customer value, and eliminating
process waste; unique from traditional process improvement strategies in that
its primary focus is on eliminating non-value added activities. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.15.9.2. <b class="calibre3">Six
Sigma. </b>A rigorous, data-driven methodology for process improvement focused
on minimizing waste through identifying, controlling, and reducing process
variation. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">21.15.9.3. <b class="calibre3">Business
Process Reengineering.</b> A comprehensive process requiring a change in the
fundamental way business processes are performed. Business process
reengineering identifies unnecessary activities and eliminates them wherever

<p class="msonormal19">21.15.9.4.<b class="calibre3"> Theory
of Constraints.</b> A systematic approach to optimize resource utilization by
identifying, exploiting, subordinating, elevating, and reassessing constraints
(bottlenecks) in the process. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">21.15.10.<b class="calibre3"> Practical
Problem Solving Method Level of Effort.</b> Different levels of effort are
required to accomplish this method initiative. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">21.15.10.1. <b class="calibre3">Just
Do It: </b>Also called point improvement, this involves one person (or a small
team) and can be accomplished in less than a day. Examples could be using
torque wrenches instead of adjustable wrenches, or routing paperwork via email
instead of the post office or paper distribution channels. </p>

<p class="msonormal51">21.15.10.2. <b class="calibre3">Rapid
Improvement Event:</b> A rapid improvement event consists of a small team of
individuals, usually subject matter experts, and can be accomplished in less
than a week and is designed to develop and implement countermeasures after
appropriate project preparations have been made. Examples could be improving
aircraft servicing cycle times, or improving first-time pass yields on task
management tool taskers. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">21.15.10.3. <b class="calibre3">Improvement
Project:</b> This setting requires a large team and is conducted over a longer
period of time. Examples might be shortening aircraft annual overhaul cycle
time or writing software to track annual overhauls. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">21.15.11.<b class="calibre3"> Summary.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal52">Practical Problem Solving Method is a structured
method to CPI. It is flexible enough to be effective at any level, from
Headquarters Air Force, to the individual Airman. This single-piece of paper
approach provides a standardized template for Airmen to solve problems and
perform process improvement initiatives. If you have questions on the usage of
Practical Problem Solving Method or want to get more training related to CPI

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre3">21.16. Introduction. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal53">"Project management? I'm not in the plans and
programs business; so why should I worry about managing a project?"<span class="calibre2">  </span>These are questions which may be on your mind
right now. If so, you may be right, for now. However, you have the likelihood
of taking positions in the future which will or do involve the sound management
of a multitude of resources. Even if you are not involved in the management of
a long-term project involving millions of dollars’ worth of resources, the
benefits of obtaining knowledge of project management principles and their
application will make you a better planner and manager. </p>

<p class="msonormal54">In addition, these same skills will easily blend
with your other management skills to improve your effectiveness as a manager
and a leader. Scores of books have been written on the topic of project
management, and this short reading cannot make you fully knowledgeable of all
aspects of project management. However, this reading will familiarize you with
some of project management's essential terminology and illustrate practical uses
of project management principles. Project management cannot be understood
unless you know a little bit about the project management language. </p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre3">21.17.</b> <b class="calibre3">Project Management. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal55">Project management uses a unique array of
terminology to communicate its principles and use. The first term we should
probably clear up right away is the term "project management."
According to Hersey and Blanchard in their book <i class="calibre4">Management </i>of <i class="calibre4">Organizational
Behavior, </i>management is defined as the process of working with and through
individuals and groups and other resources to accomplish organizational goals
(Hersey and Blanchard: 5). In their book, <i class="calibre4">Successful
Project Managers, </i>Jeffrey K. Pinto and O.P. Kharbanda define project as a
combination of human and non-human resources pulled together in a temporary
organization to achieve a specified purpose (Pinto and Kharbanda: 13). Although
there are many definitions to choose from, for the purpose of this reading
we'll use Pinto and Kharbanda's definition of project management: the process of
leading, coordinating, planning, and controlling a diverse and complex set of
processes and people in the pursuit of achieving project objectives (Pinto and
Kharbanda: 17). With this definition in mind, it may be worthy to examine what
project management is not. A project is not a program; programs are ongoing. A
project, by definition, is something temporary. Although temporary could be in
terms of years, a project is unlike a program. You are involved with many
programs in your work centers, and programs are ongoing. A project has a single
objective, which has some time frame attached to it. Armed with project
management's basic definition, we can now expand on project management's other
terms. </p>

<p class="msonormal65">21.17.1. Some of the terminology used in project

in Figure 21.1 and <b class="calibre3">Management Steps.</b>
appear in the book <i class="calibre4">Fundamentals of

</span>(Lewis: 7). </p>

<p class="msonormal66">21.17.1.1.<i class="calibre4"> </i><b class="calibre3">Define the Project Objective. </b>Identify
the problem or objective to be solved, or the improvement to be achieved by the
project. What client need is being satisfied by the project? </p>

<p class="msonormal66">21.17.1.2.<b class="calibre3">
Develop Solution Options. </b>How many ways might you go about solving the
problem? Of the available alternatives, which do you think will best solve the
problem? Some decision analysis techniques will come into play here. </p>

<p class="msonormal66">21.17.1.3.<b class="calibre3">
Plan the Project. </b>Planning is nothing more than answering questions—what
must be done, by whom, for how much, how, when, and so on. </p>

<p class="msonormal66">21.17.1.4.<b class="calibre3"> Execute
the Plan.</b><i class="calibre4"> </i>People sometimes go to
great length and effort to put together a plan, but then fail to follow it.
Follow your plan. </p>

<p class="msonormal66">21.17.1.5.<b class="calibre3">
Monitor and Control Progress</b><i class="calibre4">. </i>The
project manager must monitor and control by being present and making appropriate
decisions. This is where you'l1 determine whether or not the plan was sound and
can make adjustments as necessary. </p>

<p class="msonormal67">21.17.1.6.<b class="calibre3"> Close the
Project. </b>Once the objective has been achieved, the project is finished, but
there is still a final step that should be taken. It's time for lessons
learned—what went well, what didn't, and what should be improved? (Lewis: 7) </p>

<p class="msonormal68">21.17.1.7. Ultimately, the goal is to achieve the
objective of the project in the most logical, sensible manner. By following
these steps, you will succeed. Sound simple? We all know there is more to it
than just knowing the steps. Once a realization of the steps of project
management is attained, accomplishing these steps requires understanding of
some more terminology. </p>

<p class="msonormal69">21.17.2. Before you can complete Step 1 of project
management, you have to ensure the problem or improvement opportunity is
clearly defined by the project objective. You might say that an objective is
simply a goal, but in reality, when it comes to project management, an objective
has to be more specific than a typical broad goal. According to Marion E.
Haynes in her book, <i class="calibre4">Project Management:
From Idea to Implementation, </i>good objectives are SMART. SMART is an
acronym, which stands for Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Realistic, and
Time-limited. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.17.2.1. Specific because a good objective says exactly
what you want it to say. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.17.2.2. Measurable because you want to be able to
determine whether you have met the objective. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.17.2.3. Action-oriented by using statements that have
action-tense verbs and are complete sentences. In other words, make the
objective active voice, not passive voice. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.17.2.4. Realistic because good objectives must be
attainable yet should present a challenge. </p>

<p class="msonormal19">21.17.2.5. Time-limited because a specific time should be
set by which to achieve the objective (Haynes: 16). </p>

<p class="msonormal70">21.17.3. For example, "Accomplish the
renovation of the office area" would be an example of a goal you wish to
achieve. A SMART objective for such a goal might be: "Renovate the office
area by June 30, 200X at a cost not to exceed $12,000." By specifying the
objective of the project, you can now determine the constraints you have to
operate under. </p>

<p class="msonormal69">21.17.4. Constraints are numerous for all
activities we endeavor, but constraint consideration is crucial for project
management. According to Geoff Reiss in his book, <i class="calibre4">Project Management Demystified, </i>quality, time, and cost are the
main constraints realized in project management. Quality refers to being in
accordance with the requirement - the specifications. Time refers to the amount
of time you have to complete the project. Cost, of course, refers to your
resource constraints, to include the four M's necessary to complete the
project: money, manpower, machinery, and materials. One of these constraints
(Quality, Time, and Cost) will be your driver for the project (Reiss: 39). To
understand the meaning of driver, let's examine some of National Aeronautics
and Space Administration's projects. In the 1960s, a manned vehicle called
Sputnik broke through the earth's atmosphere, and the space race began. In an
effort to catch-up, time became a driver for National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's project to launch a man into space. The amount of money spent
or the quality of the materials, although important, did not drive the project.
However, during the 1980s, the explosion of the Challenger caused National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to change drivers. Now quality became the
driver for future projects. The driver for your project will have an impact on
the other two constraints affecting your project. Ensure you take this into
consideration when making decisions about your project's objective. If time is
the driver, the T of your SMART objective needs to be reflective of that
driving influence. If quality is your driver, the S of your SMART objective
needs to be predominant. How will quality being your driver affect the other
constraints? Quality increases the amount of time taken and increases the
expense of materials. You must always remain cognizant of the impact one
constraint has on another and adjust the management of your project
accordingly. Ultimately, your driver and affected constraints will have an
impact on the solutions you develop. As the project manager, it is incumbent
upon you to provide the leadership and use good team-building techniques to
establish a sound project objective and generate the solution options necessary
to achieve those objectives. Once these steps have been completed, it will then
be time to embark upon the most important and timeconsuming aspect of project
management—planning. </p>

<p class="msonormal71">21.17.5. As indicated earlier, planning the project
involves answering several questions. The first of those questions is: what
must be done? The answer is contained in the objective of the project, but more
specifics are needed. Haynes states that the starting place for answering the
question of what must be done is by using a work breakdown structure. A work
breakdown structure is a technique based on dividing a project into sub-units,
or work packages. Since all the elements required to complete the project are
identified in the work breakdown structure, the chances of neglecting or
overlooking an essential step are minimized. A work breakdown structure is
typically constructed with two or three levels of detail, although more levels
are quite common depending on the complexity of the project (Haynes: 25). To
illustrate using an elementary example, Figure 21.2 depicts a work breakdown
structure for a typical yard project. Granted, a work breakdown structure would
not usually be constructed for such a project, but to illustrate the concept,
it is best to use something very simple to start with. </p>

<p class="msonormal72">21.17.6. Graphically, you can quickly ascertain the
necessary tasks to complete the project. Such a structure for your project will
permit you, and others who see the work breakdown structure, to readily
identify what needs to be done, spot omissions which might later affect the
outcome of the project, and make suggestions for improving and expanding the
work breakdown structure. How much is too much detail? According to Lewis, the
general guideline is that you stop breaking down the work when you reach a
point at which you can estimate to the desired degree of accuracy, or at which
the work will take an amount of time equal to the smallest units you want to
schedule (Lewis: 41 ). Taking Figure 21.2's work breakdown structure as an
example, although the ‘trim hedge’ element of the project is an element that
needs to be included as part of the work breakdown structure, it is not
necessary to further indicate whether the hedge should be squared or rounded,
done from left to right or top to bottom, etc. The amount of breakdown is an
element the project manager and the project team must decide upon. Once the
work breakdown structure has been tweaked and finalized, the next step is task
analysis. </p>

Like the work breakdown structure, the amount of detail needed for the task
analysis depends on the task involved and the desires of the project manager
and project team. The more complex the project, the greater the importance of
detailed task analysis. Figure 21.3 depicts a typical task analysis and details
considered using our elementary example task pertaining to the yard project. As
you can see from the example, a wealth of <sub class="calibre24"><span class="calibre25"><span class="calibre2"> </span></span></sub>information
is contained about the </p>

<p class="msonormal76"><sub class="calibre24"><span class="calibre25"><span class="calibre2"> </span><span class="calibre2">        </span></span></sub>task
which is not depicted in the work <span class="calibre2">                </span>breakdown
<span class="calibre2">           </span>structure, <span class="calibre2">              </span>to include task milestones, more
specific information of how the milestones can be measured, and identification
of dependent tasks, budgetary concerns, task assignments, and reporting
requirements. As the project manager, you can delegate the task analysis for
each task to the appropriate person. Once they are compiled, you can make final
decisions on task assignments and budgetary concerns. The task analysis is what
provides the crucial information for determining how the tasks of the project
interrelate. For example, in the case of the yard project, the tasks associated
with preparing the equipment must be completed prior to any of the other tasks
being accomplished. There is no sense in accomplishing cleanup if you haven't done
any of the work yet. Although this example may seem to be common sense, when
larger projects are in the planning stage, it is imperative the proper
sequencing of tasks occurs prior to beginning a project to ensure the
efficiency of the project. You wouldn't want carpet installed in your home
prior to painting the ceiling and the walls, right? Once a task analysis has
been performed on all tasks associated with the project, the next phase of
project management, scheduling, must be conducted.<b class="calibre3"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal70">21.17.8. The advent of computer software has made
scheduling tasks for projects much easier than it used to be. According to
Lewis, until around 1958, the only tool for scheduling projects was the bar
chart (Lewis: 50). Figure 21.4 below depicts a simple bar chart constructed
from a word-processing software package using a table. As you can see, the time
taken to complete a task is depicted graphically as one of the dark colored
bars in 5-minute increments. </p>

<p class="msonormal"><b class="calibre1">Chapter 19 </b></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre1">SECURITY </b></p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 19A—Overview </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre1">19.1. Introduction.</b> The purpose of security is to never permit the
enemy to acquire unexpected advantage…The lethal consequences of enemy attack
make the security of friendly forces a paramount concern. Security applies to
all members of the Air Force at all times. In certain positions, Airmen are
required to handle classified information; at other times, Airmen may be
required to serve in a foreign country. Such is the diversity of security. This
chapter covers information assurance, installation security, and antiterrorism.
These topics are essential to the Air Force mission and the security of all
resources. Along with information presented in Chapters 5, Emergency Management
Program, and 6, Standards of Conduct, this information helps ensure Air Force
forces are prepared to face any adversary. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 19B—Information Assurance
</i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">19.2. Information
Assurance: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">19.2.1. Information assurance refers to the
measures that protect and defend information and information systems by
ensuring their availability, integrity, confidentiality, authentication, and
non-repudiation. These measures include providing for restoration of
information and information systems by incorporating protection, detection, and
reaction capabilities. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">19.2.2. The Air Force implements and maintains the
information assurance program to secure information and information technology
assets. The Air Force achieves these objectives through the effective
employment of its core information assurance disciplines of computer security,
communications security, and TEMPEST (formerly known as emissions security). </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">19.3. Computer
Security: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.3.1.<b class="calibre1"> Definition.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal8">Computer security consists of measures and controls
that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems
assets including hardware, software, firmware, and information being processed,
stored, and communicated. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">19.3.1.1. Limited Authorized Personal Use.
Government-provided hardware and software are for official use and limited
authorized personal use only. Limited personal use must be of reasonable
duration and frequency that have been approved by the supervisors and do not
adversely affect performance of official duties, overburden systems or reflect
adversely on the Air Force or the Department of Defense. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.3.1.2. All personal use must be consistent with the
requirements of Department of Defense 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">19.3.1.3. Internet-based capabilities are all publicly
accessible information capabilities and applications available across the
Internet in locations not owned, operated, or controlled by the Department of
Defense or the Federal Government. Internet-based capabilities include
collaborative tools such as simple notification service, social media,
user-generated content, social software, e-mail, instant messaging, and
discussion forums (e.g., YouTube, Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, Google Apps,
etc.). </p>

<p class="msonormal12">19.3.1.4. When accessing Internet-based
capabilities using Federal Government resources in an authorized personal or
unofficial capacity, individuals shall comply with operations security guidance
(AFI 10-701, <i class="calibre2">Operations Security</i>) and
shall not represent the policies or official position of the Air Force or
Department of Defense. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.3.2. <b class="calibre1">Information
Systems.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal13">An information system is a discrete set of
information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance,
use, sharing, dissemination or disposition of information. Note: Information
Systems also include specialized systems such as industrial/process controls
systems, telephone switching and private branch systems, and environmental
control systems. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.3.3. <b class="calibre1">Countermeasures.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal10">Every Air Force information system has vulnerabilities
(system security weaknesses) and is susceptible to exploitation (to gain access
to information or disrupt critical processing). A countermeasure is any action,
device, procedure, or technique that meets or opposes (i.e. counters) a threat,
vulnerability or attack by eliminating, preventing, or minimizing damage, or by
discovering and reporting the event, so corrective action(s) can be taken. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.3.4. <b class="calibre1">Threats.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal14">Not all threats to our national security are
conventional in nature. Threats include, but are not limited to any
circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational
operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational
assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information
system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of
information and/or denial of service. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.3.5. <b class="calibre1">Malicious
Logic Protection. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal15">The Air Force must protect information systems from
viruses and other forms of malicious logic by using a combination of human and
technological countermeasures to ensure the protection is maintained throughout
the lifecycle of the information system. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.3.5.1. <b class="calibre1">Infection.</b>
The invasion of information systems applications, processes, or services by a
virus or malware code causing the information system to malfunction. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.3.5.2. <b class="calibre1">Detection.</b>
A signature or behavior-based antivirus system that signals when an anomaly
caused by a virus or malware occurs. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.3.5.3. <b class="calibre1">Reaction.</b>
If you are notified of a virus or malware detection, immediately notify your
information system security officer and follow local procedures. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.3.6. <b class="calibre1">General
Protection of Information Systems. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">All authorized users must protect information systems
against tampering, theft, and loss. Protection from insider and outsider
threats occurs by controlling physical access to the facility and data. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">19.3.6.1. Ensure user access to information system
resources and information is based upon their security clearance and need to
know. Ensure protection of applicable unclassified, sensitive, and/or
classified information using encryption according to the applicable Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2, <i class="calibre2">Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">19.3.6.2. Protect against casual viewing of
information. Place devices that display (or output) classified and sensitive
information in a location that deters unauthorized individuals from reading the
information. Ensure buildings and rooms that contain information systems are
locked during non-duty hours. Classified information systems should be stored
in a General Services Administration approved safe or in buildings or areas
cleared for open storage of classified. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.3.7. <b class="calibre1">Removable
Media Control. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal17">Storage media includes, but is not limited to,
compact discs, external storage drives, and universal serial bus drives (memory
sticks, jump drives, pen drives, etc.). These devices have memory storage
capability and are categorized as removable media. Because of the capacity of
their memory storage and their portable nature, these devices pose an increased
risk of data tampering, theft, or loss. At a minimum, personnel must use these
preventive measures: </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.3.7.1. Safeguard, mark, and label removable media
according to the requirements for the highest level of information ever
contained on the media using applicable information security guidance. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.3.7.2. Report loss or suspected loss of removable media
containing sensitive information according to applicable information security
guidance from your local security manager or information systems security
officer. </p>

<p class="msonormal15">19.3.7.3. Clear, sanitize, or destroy removable
media used to store sensitive information before releasing to unauthorized
personnel or outside Department of Defense or Air Force control. Contact your
local information systems security officer for guidance and procedures. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.3.7.4. Use your local security guidance before
attaching any removable media or storage device to an information system. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">19.3.7.5. Do not use disguised removable media or
storage devices. Air Force policy defines disguised as a device designed to
look like anything other than removable media or a storage device (for example,
watch, pen, flashlight, etc.). </p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.3.8. <b class="calibre1">Mobile
Computing Devices. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal10">Mobile computing devices are information systems such as
portable electronic devices, laptops, smartphones, and other handheld devices
that can store data locally and access Air Force managed networks through
mobile access capabilities. While many mobile computing devices may have
specific security policy and procedures governing their use, all of these
devices should follow the same basic requirements. </p>

<p class="msonormal18">19.3.8.1. All wireless systems (including
associated peripheral devices, operation systems, applications, network
connection methods, and services) must be approved prior to processing
Department of Defense information. The information systems security officer
will maintain documented approval authority and inventory information on all
approved devices. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.3.8.2. All mobile computing devices (not assigned or in
use) must be secured to prevent tampering or theft. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.3.8.3. Users of mobile devices will sign a detailed
user agreement outlining the responsibilities and restrictions for use. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.3.9. <b class="calibre1">Public
Computing Facilities or Services. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal16">Do not use public computing facilities or services
(Internet cafés and kiosks, hotel business centers, etc.) to process
government-owned unclassified, sensitive, or classified information. Public
computing facilities or services include any information technology resources
not under your private or United States governmental control. Use of these
resources to access Web-based government services (Outlook® messaging software,
Web applications, etc.) constitutes a compromise of login credentials and must
be reported as a security incident according to the current Air Force guidance
on computer security. </p>

<p class="msonormal19"><b class="calibre1">19.4. Communications
Security. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal20">Communications security refers to measures and
controls taken to deny unauthorized persons information derived from
information systems of the United States government related to national
security and to ensure the authenticity of such information systems.
Communications security protection results from applying security measures
(i.e., crypto security, transmission security, and emission security) to
communications and information systems generating, handling, storing,
processing, or using classified or sensitive information, the loss of which
could adversely affect the national security interest. Communications security
also entails applying physical security measures to communications security
information or materials. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.4.1. <b class="calibre1">Cryptosecurity.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal21">Cryptosecurity is a component of communications security
resulting from the provision and proper use of technically sound cryptosystems.
</p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.4.2.<b class="calibre1"> Transmission
Security. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal18">Transmission security is a component of
communications security resulting from the application of measures designed to
protect transmissions from interception and exploitation by means other than
cryptoanalysis. Examples of transmission security measures include using
secured communications systems, registered mail, secure telephone and facsimile
equipment, manual cryptosystems, call signs, or authentication to transmit
classified information. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.4.3. <b class="calibre1">Physical
Security. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal22">Physical security is the part of communications
security resulting from the use of all physical measures necessary to safeguard
communications security material from access by unauthorized persons. Physical
security measures include the application of control procedures and physical
barriers. Physical security also ensures continued integrity, prevents access
by unauthorized persons, and controls the spread of communications security
techniques and technology when not in the best interest of the United States
and allies of the United States. Common physical security measures include
verifying the need to know and clearance of personnel granted access, following
proper storage and handling procedures, accurately accounting for all
materials, transporting materials using authorized means, and immediately
reporting the loss or possible compromise of materials. </p>

<p class="msonormal23"><b class="calibre1">19.5. TEMPEST
(formerly known as Emissions Security). </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><b class="calibre1">TEMPEST</b>
is protection resulting from all measures taken to deny unauthorized persons
information of value that may be derived from the interception and analysis of
compromising emanations from crypto equipment, information systems, and
telecommunications systems. The objective of emissions security is to deny
access to classified and, in some instances, unclassified information that
contain compromising emanations within an inspectable space. The inspectable
space is considered the area in which it would be difficult for an adversary
with specialized equipment to attempt to intercept compromising emanations
without being detected. TEMPEST countermeasures (classified/unclassified
equipment separation, shielding, grounding, etc.) are implemented to reduce the
risk of compromising emanations escaping the inspectable space. The TEMPEST
countermeasures must be validated by the Certified TEMPEST Technical Authority
prior to any classified processing in the facility. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">19.6. Operations Security:</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.6.1. <b class="calibre1">Operations
Security Defined:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.6.1.1. Operation security is a process of identifying,
analyzing, and controlling critical information indicating friendly actions
associated with military operations and other activities to: </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre3"> </span>19.6.1.1.1.
Identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems. </p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre3"> </span>19.6.1.2.2.
Determine what specific indications could be collected, analyzed, and
interpreted to derive critical information in time to be useful to adversaries.
</p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span class="calibre3"> </span>19.6.1.3.3. Select
and execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the
vulnerabilities of<span class="calibre3">  </span>friendly actions to
adversary exploitation. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.6.1.2. Operation security is closely integrated and
synchronized with other influence operations capabilities to protect operations
and is not a collection of specific rules and instructions that can be applied
to every operation. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.6.2. <b class="calibre1">Purpose. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal13">The purpose of Operation security is to reduce the
vulnerability of Air Force missions by eliminating or reducing successful
adversary collection and exploitation of critical information. Operation
security applies to all activities that prepare, sustain, or employ forces
during all phases of operations. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.6.3.<b class="calibre1"> Operational
Context. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal14">Operational effectiveness is enhanced when
commanders and other decision makers apply Operation security from the earliest
stages of planning. Operation security involves a series of analyses to examine
the planning, preparation, execution, and post execution phases of any
operation or activity across the entire spectrum of military action and in any
operational environment. Operation security analysis provides decision makers with
a means of weighing the risk to their operations. Decision makers must
determine the amount of risk they are willing to accept in particular
operational circumstances in the same way as operations risk management allows
commanders to assess risk in mission planning. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.6.4. <b class="calibre1">Signature
Management Methodology Defined:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal17">19.6.4.1. Signature management is the active
defense or exploitation of operational profiles resident at a given military
installation. Defense of operational profiles is accomplished by implementing
protective signature management measures to deny adversary collection of
critical information. </p>

<p class="msonormal25">19.6.4.2. Base profiling is a process within
signature management that identifies the local operating environment and
captures process points that present key signatures and profiles with critical
information value. This process is the deliberate effort to identify functional
areas and the observables they produce to contribute to the overall signature
of day-to-day activities and operational trends. <span class="calibre3">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.6.5.<b class="calibre1"> Implementing
Operation Security.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal26">Air Force forces can be under observation at their
peacetime bases and locations, in training or exercises, while moving, or when
deployed to the field conducting actual operations. Operation security
methodology provides systematic and comprehensive analysis designed to identify
observable friendly actions that could reveal intentions or capabilities. Air
Force units utilize the base profiling process to identify vulnerabilities and
indicators of their day-to-day activities. With this understanding, Air Force
operation security program managers use the signature management methodology to
apply measures and/or countermeasures to hide, control, or simulate
indicators.<span class="calibre3">   </span>Therefore, operation
security principles must be integrated into operational, support, exercise, and
acquisition planning. Operation security is incorporated into day-to-day
activities to ensure a seamless transition to contingency operations. The
operation security process consists of five distinct steps: </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.6.5.1. Identify critical information. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.6.5.2. Analyze threats. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.6.5.3. Analyze vulnerabilities. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.6.5.4. Assess risk. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.6.5.5. Apply appropriate operation security
countermeasures. </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><span class="calibre3"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.6.6. <b class="calibre1">Operation
Security Indicators. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal9">Operation security indicators are friendly,
detectable actions, and open-source information that can be interpreted or
pieced together by an adversary to derive critical information. The five basic
characteristics of operation security indicators that make them potentially
valuable to an adversary include: </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.6.6.1. <b class="calibre1">Signatures.
</b>This characteristic of an indicator is identifiable or to stand out. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.6.6.2. <b class="calibre1">Associations.
</b>The relationship of an indicator to other information or activities. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.6.6.3. <b class="calibre1">Profiles.
</b>Each functional activity generates their own set of more-or-less unique
signatures and associations. The sum of these signatures and associations is
the activity’s profile. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.6.6.4. <b class="calibre1">Contrasts.
</b>Any differences observed between an activity’s standard profile and most

<p class="msonormal29">All personnel in the Air Force are responsible for
protecting classified information and controlled unclassified information under
their custody and control. </p>

<p class="msonormal30">19.7.1.<b class="calibre1">
Classified Information. </b>Information shall be classified only to protect
national security. There are three levels of classification: Top Secret,
Secret, and Confidential. Information may only be classified by either original
classification or derivative classification. Each individual is responsible for
providing the proper safeguards for classified information, reporting security
incidents, and understand the sanctions for noncompliance. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">19.7.1.1. <b class="calibre1">Top
Secret.</b> Top Secret shall be applied to information the unauthorized
disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave
damage to the national security that the original classification authority is
able to identify or describe. </p>

<p class="msonormal9">19.7.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Secret.</b>
Secret shall be applied to information the unauthorized disclosure of which
reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security

that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">19.7.1.4.<b class="calibre1">
Original Classification. </b>Original classification is the initial decision by
an original classification authority that an item of information could
reasonably be expected to cause identifiable or describable damage to the
national security subjected to unauthorized disclosure and requires protection
in the interest of national security. Only officials designated in writing may
make original classification decisions. </p>

<p class="msonormal31">19.7.1.5. <b class="calibre1">Derivative
Classification</b>. Air Force policy is to identify, classify, downgrade,
declassify, mark, protect, and destroy classified information consistent with
national policy. Controlled unclassified information will also be protected per
national policy, DoDM 5200.01, Volumes 1 and 4, <i class="calibre2">Department of Defense Information Security Program</i>: <i class="calibre2">Overview, Classification, and

Security Program, </i>provide the guidance for managing classified information
and controlled unclassified information. Within the Department of Defense all
cleared personnel are authorized to derivatively classify information provided
they have received initial training before making derivative classification
decisions and refresher at least once every 2 years. Derivative classification
is the incorporating, paraphrasing, restating, or generating classified
information in a new form or document and is not photocopying or otherwise
mechanically or electronically reproducing classified material. Derivative
classifiers must use authorized types of sources for making decisions. One of
the most important responsibilities of derivative classifier is to observe and
respect the classification determinations made by an original classification
authority. </p>

<p class="msonormal32">19.7.1.6. <b class="calibre1">Marking
Classified Information.</b> All classified information shall be clearly
identified by marking, designation, or electronic labelling in accordance with
DoDM 5200.01, Vol 2,<i class="calibre2"> Department of

<p class="msonormal38">19.7.1.7. <b class="calibre1">Specific
Markings on Documents. </b>Every classified document must be marked to show the
highest classification of information contained within the document. The
marking must be conspicuous enough to alert anyone handling the document that
the document is classified. Every document will contain the overall
classification of the document, portion markings indicating the classification
level of specific classified information within the document, the originating
office, date of origin, and downgrading instructions, if any, and
declassification instructions. The three most common markings on a classified
document are the banner lines, portion markings, and the classification
authority block. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">19.7.1.7.1. <b class="calibre1">Banner
Lines.</b> Are conspicuously placed at the top and bottom of the outside of the
front cover (if any), title page (if any), first page, and on the outside of

<p class="msonormal38">19.7.1.7.3. <b class="calibre1">Classification
Authority Block.</b> This block appears on the face of each classified United
States document unless otherwise stated in DoDM 5200.01, Volumes 1-4. There are
two types of classification authority blocks. One is used by an original
classifier and the other by a derivative classifier. Original classification
authority block will contain a: Classified By (name of classifier), Reason,
Downgrade To (if any), and Declassify On line. Refer to DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2,
<i class="calibre2">Department of Defense Information

<p class="msonormal25">19.7.1.8. <b class="calibre1">Challenges.
</b>Personnel should submit challenges of classification to their security
manager or the classifier of the information if substantial reason exists to
indicate the document has been classified improperly or unnecessarily </p>

<p class="msonormal39">19.7.1.9.<b class="calibre1">
Safeguarding.</b> Everyone who works with classified information is personally
responsible for taking proper precautions to ensure that unauthorized persons
do not gain access to classified information. There are two primary types of
protection that must be employed at all times: (1) store the information using
approved means; or (2) having it under the personal observation and control of
an authorized individual. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">19.7.1.9.1. <b class="calibre1">Access
to Classified Information.</b> Before granting access to classified information
the person must have: (1) security clearance eligibility; (2) a signed Standard
Form 312, <i class="calibre2">Classified Information
Non-Disclosure Agreement</i>; and (3) a need-to-know. The individual’s
responsibility with authorized possession, knowledge, or control of the
information is to determine whether the person receiving the information has
been granted the appropriate security clearance access by proper authority. </p>

<p class="msonormal40">19.7.1.9.2. <b class="calibre1">Protection
When Under Personal Observation or Control.</b> An authorized person shall keep
classified material removed from storage under constant surveillance. The
authorized person must place coversheets on classified documents not in secure
storage to prevent unauthorized persons from viewing the information. The
following forms will be used to cover classified information outside of
storage: Standard Form 703, <i class="calibre2">Top Secret</i>,
Standard Form 704, <i class="calibre2">Secret</i>, and
Standard Form 705, <i class="calibre2">Confidential</i>. </p>

<p class="msonormal42">19.7.1.9.3. <b class="calibre1">End-of-Day
Security Checks.</b> Use Standard Form 701, <i class="calibre2">Activity
Security Checklist</i>, to record the end of the day security check if you are
appointed to conduct the check. This form is required for any area where
classified information is used or stored. Ensure all vaults, secure rooms, and
containers used for storing classified material are checked.<i class="calibre2"> </i></p>

<p class="msonormal43">19.7.1.9.4. <b class="calibre1">Security
Incidents Involving Classified Information.</b> Anyone finding classified
material out of proper control must take custody of and safeguard the material
and immediately notify his or her commander, supervisor or security manager.
The terms associated with security incidents are formally defined DoDM 5200.01
Volume 3. The following general characterizations are provided: </p>

<p class="msonormal44">19.7.1.9.4.1. <b class="calibre1">Infraction.</b>
An infraction is a security incident involving failure to comply with
requirements which cannot reasonably be expected to, and does not, result in
the loss, suspected compromise, or compromise of classified information. An
infraction may be unintentional or inadvertent and does not constitute a
security violation, if left uncorrected, can lead to security violations or compromises.
Infraction requires an inquiry to facilitate immediate corrective action but
does not require an in-depth investigation. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">19.7.1.9.4.2. <b class="calibre1">Violation.</b>
Violations are security incidents that indicate knowing, willful, and negligent
for security regulations, and result in, or could be expected to result in, the
loss or compromise of classified information. Security violations require an
inquiry and/or investigation. </p>

<p class="msonormal46">19.7.1.9.4.3. <b class="calibre1">Compromise.</b>
A compromise is a security incident (more specifically, a violation) in which
there is an unauthorized disclosure of classified information (i.e., disclosure
to a person(s) who does not have a valid clearance, authorized access, or a
need to know). </p>

<p class="msonormal33">19.7.1.9.4.4. <b class="calibre1">Loss.</b>
A loss occurs when classified information cannot be physically located or
accounted for (e.g., classified information/equipment is discovered missing
during an audit and cannot be immediately located). </p>

<p class="msonormal47">19.7.1.9.5. <b class="calibre1">Data
Spills</b>. Classified data spills occur when classified data is introduced
either onto an unclassified information system or to an information system with
a lower level of classification, or to a system not accredited to process data
of that restrictive category.<span class="calibre3">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal39">19.7.1.9.6. <b class="calibre1">Information
Appearing in the Public Media. </b>If classified information appears in the
public media, including on public Internet sites, or if approached by a
representative of the media, personnel shall be careful not to make any
statement or comment that confirms the accuracy of or verifies the information
requiring protection. Immediately report the matter to your supervisor,
security manager, or commander, but do not discuss with anyone who does not, in
the case of classified information, have an appropriate security clearance and
need to know. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.7.2. <b class="calibre1">Controlled
Unclassified Information.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal48">In addition to classified information, certain types
of unclassified information also require application of access and distribution
controls and protective measures for a variety of reasons. Such information is referred
to collectively as controlled unclassified information. Requirements, controls,
and protective measures developed for Department of Defense controlled
unclassified information (i.e., For Official Use Only), (Law Enforcement
Sensitive, Department of Defense Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information,
and LIMITED DISTRIBUTION) as well as some of those developed by other Executive
Branch agencies are found in DoDM 5200.01 Volume 4. The originator of a
document is responsible for determining at origination whether the information
may qualify for controlled unclassified information status. Before provided to
the public all Department of Defense unclassified information must be reviewed
and approved for release. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">19.7.2.1. <b class="calibre1">For
Official Use Only Information.</b> For official use only information is the
most commonly used controlled unclassified information category in the Air
Force and Department of Defense. For official use only information is a
dissemination control applied by the Department of Defense to unclassified
information when disclosure to the public of that particular record, or portion
thereof, would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an
interest protected by one or more of the Freedom of Information Act Exemptions
2 through 9. Refer to DoDM 5200.01, Volume 4, <i class="calibre2">Department of Defense Information Security Program: Controlled
Unclassified Information</i> for additional information on Freedom of
Information Act exemptions. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.7.2.2. <b class="calibre1">Marking
For Official Use Only information.</b> Information that has been determined to
qualify for official use only status shall be indicated by markings. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.7.2.2.1. Each document will identify the originating
office to allow someone receiving the document to contact the office if
questions or problems about the designation or marking arise. </p>

<p class="msonormal14">19.7.2.2.2. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY or
UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY will be marked at the bottom of the outside
of the front cover (if there is one), the title page, the first page, and the

appear at both the top and bottom. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.7.2.2.4. Subjects, titles, and each section, part,
paragraph, or similar port shall be marked using the parenthetical notation
(For Official Use Only) or (U// For Official Use Only if it contains For
Official Use Only information). </p>

<p class="msonormal8">19.7.2.3. <b class="calibre1">Access
to For Official Use Only.</b> No person may have access to information
designated as For Official Use Only information unless they have a valid need
for access in connection with the accomplishment of a lawful and authorized
Government purpose. The final responsibility for determining whether an
individual has a valid need for access to information designated for official
use only status rests with the individual who has authorized possession,
knowledge, or control of the information. </p>

<p class="msonormal16">19.7.2.4. <b class="calibre1">Protection
of For Official Use Only.</b> During work hours, reasonable steps shall be
taken to minimize the risk of access by unauthorized personnel, i.e. not
leaving for official use only status information unattended where unauthorized
personnel are present. After working hours, store the information in unlocked
containers, desks, or cabinets if the building is provided security by
Government or Government-contract personnel. If building security is not
provided or deemed inadequate, store the information in locked desks, file cabinets,
bookcases, or locked rooms. </p>

<p class="msonormal50"><b class="calibre1">19.8. Personnel
Security:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">19.8.1. The Personnel Security Program entails
policies and procedures that ensure military, civilian, and contractor
personnel who access classified information or occupy a sensitive position are
consistent with interests of national security.<span class="calibre3"> 
</span>It involves the investigation process, adjudication for eligibility, and
the continuous evaluation for maintaining eligibility.<span class="calibre3">  </span>Commanders and supervisors must continually
observe and evaluate their subordinates with respect to these criteria and
immediately report any unfavorable conduct or conditions that come to their
attention that might bear on the subordinates’ trustworthiness and eligibility

<p class="msonormal5">19.8.2. The Department of Defense Central
Adjudication Facility is the designated adjudicative authority to grant, deny,
and revoke security clearance eligibility. Eligibility is adjudicated using the
Department of Defense 13 Adjudicative Guidelines while applying the whole

<p class="msonormal23"><b class="calibre1">19.9. Industrial
Security: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal56">19.9.1. <b class="calibre1">Policy.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal57">Air Force policy is to identify in classified contracts
specific government information and sensitive resources that must be protected
against compromise or loss while entrusted to industry. AFI 31-601, <i class="calibre2">Industrial Security Program Management, </i>assigns
functional responsibilities and establishes a system of review that identifies
outdated, inappropriate, and unnecessary contractual security requirements.
Policy also outlines and provides guidance for establishing on-base integrated
contractor visitor groups. </p>

<p class="msonormal55">19.9.2. <b class="calibre1">Scope.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal16">The security policies, requirements, and procedures
identified in AFI 31-601 are applicable to Air Force personnel and on-base
Department of Defense contractors performing services under the terms of a
properly executed contract and associated security agreement or similar
document, as determined appropriate by the installation commander. </p>

<p class="msonormal19"><b class="calibre1">19.10. Integrated
Defense Program: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal58">19.10.1. The Air Force Integrated Defense Program is
the integration of multidisciplinary active and passive, offensive and
defensive capabilities, employed to mitigate potential risks and defeat
adversary threats to Air Force operations within the base boundary and the base
security zone. These threats include, but are not limited to, terrorist,
insiders, criminals, and foreign intelligence and security services. To
integrate Integrated Defense efforts with other Air Force capabilities to
achieve synergistic effects using an all-hazards approach is critical.
Potential hazards to an installation include, but are not limited to, chemical
biological radiological nuclear-high yield explosive attacks, natural and
man-made disasters, major accidents, and accidental or deliberate release of
hazardous materials, toxic industrial materials or chemicals (see AFPD 31-1, <i class="calibre2">Integrated Defense</i>). Integrated Defense
is a fundamental battle competency for all Airmen, whether garrison or
deployed. The teaming of Integrated Defense forces creates a united, seamless
defense stronger than the defensive efforts of individuals/or individual units.
This effort ensures all Airmen are trained to defend themselves and integrate
into defense operations while in garrison or deployed. Installation commanders
determine the effects required of Integrated Defense operations at Air Force
installations based on a four-step process that involves: <b class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3"> </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal59">19.10.1.1. Determining and prioritizing the criticality of
installation assets. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.10.1.2. Analyzing the threats and operating
environment. </p>

<p class="msonormal59">19.10.1.3. Assessing the installation’s vulnerabilities to
the threats. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">19.10.1.4. Making prudent integrated defense decisions
based on the risk estimate. The integrated defense risk management process is
critical in order for the installation commander to make the best use of
limited resources and personnel available to execute the Integrated Defense
mission. </p>

<p class="msonormal60">19.10.2. Integrated defense is an “all-Airmen”
program. However, Air Force Security Forces have enterprise lead in Integrated
Defense operations. The defense force commander synchronizes integrated defense
operations with emergency and consequence management activities articulated in
applicable Air Force and Department of Defense publications. </p>

<p class="msonormal61">19.10.3. The goal of Integrated Defense is to
neutralize security threats within the base boundary and the base security zone
in order to ensure unhindered Air Force operations. Through Integrated Defense,
commanders must: (1) minimize mission degradation from threat activity within
the base boundary and coordinate necessary security operations support within
the base security zone when the base security zone is not congruent with the
base boundary; (2) minimize loss of life and injury from threat activity; and
(3) protect government property and personnel from hostile and criminal acts. </p>

<p class="msonormal62">19.10.4. Integrated Defense does not stand alone to
protect personnel and resources; planners create an effective security program
by coordinating with other Department of Defense and Air Force programs.
Furthermore, the protection and defense of air bases requires the coordinated
effort of emergency management, antiterrorism, and other mission support
function forces under the mission assurance umbrella. This coordinated planning
provides a seamless progression of mission assurance programs and completes the
installation’s defense in depth picture.<b class="calibre1">
</b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">19.10.5.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Joint
Publications define the base boundary as a line that delineates the surface
area of a base for the purpose of facilitating coordination and deconfliction
of operations between adjacent units, formations, or areas. See Figure 19.1 for
an example of a base boundary configuration. Therefore, the base boundary is
not necessarily the base perimeter. Rather, the base boundary should be
established based upon the factors of mission, enemy, terrain and weather,
troops and support available, time available, civil considerations,
specifically balancing the need of the base defense forces to control key
terrain with their ability to accomplish the mission. These measures decrease
the likelihood of fratricide, prevent noncombatant casualties, and minimize
damage to the property of friendly civilians. Boundaries may not necessarily
coincide with the fenced perimeter, property lines or legal boundaries.
Nevertheless, while tactical considerations will ideally determine Integrated
Defense boundaries, the defense force commander will strictly adhere to legal,
jurisdictional, host nation constraints, commander’s intent, and higher echelon
orders and directives when conducting operations within the base boundary. </p>

<p class="msonormal63">19.10.6.<b class="calibre1"> </b>The
base security zone is an Air Force unique concept and term to be used
intraservice only. The Air Force uses the planning term base security zone to
describe the area of concern around an air base and to support the
establishment and adjustment of the base boundary. The base security zone is the
area outside the base perimeter from which the base </p>

Configuration<span class="calibre3">  </span><span class="calibre3">              </span></b>may be vulnerable from standoff threats (for
example, mortars, rockets, man portable aerial defense systems). The
installation commander should identify the base security zone and coordinate
via the operational chain of command with local, state, federal agencies
(within the continental United States) or host nation or area commander
(outside the continental United States) for the base security zone to be identified
as the base boundary. If the base boundary does not include all of the base
security zone terrain, the installation commander is still responsible <span class="calibre3"> </span>for <span class="calibre3">          </span>either
<span class="calibre3">     </span>mitigating <span class="calibre3">             </span>(through coordination with local, state, federal
agencies (continental United States) or the area commander or host nation
(outside the continental United States) or accepting the risks of enemy attack
from the terrain outside the base boundary. The base security zone, in the
simplest terms, is the area from which a threat can launch an attack against
base personnel and resources or aircraft approaching/departing the base.
Air-minded forces must consider the base security zone for planning constructs
continental United States, outside the continental United States, and at contingency
locations. Threats vary in the Integrated Defense continuum from peacetime to
wartime, regardless of the location of our installations. </p>

<p class="msonormal49">19.10.6.1. Optimally, the base security zone and
the base boundary are the same, but that is not always the case. The base
security zone may, for planning purposes, incorporate more geographical area
than the base boundary. For example, there may be key terrain outside the base
boundary from which adversaries can impact air operations. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">19.10.6.2. For terrain outside the base boundary,
but within the base security zone, the defense force commander should
coordinate with local, state, federal agencies (continental United States) or
host nation or area commander (outside the continental United States) to
conduct base defense tasks within the area. If these forces/agencies are not
available due to competing requirements, then the defense force commander
should coordinate via their operational chain of command with the appropriate
area commander to conduct the base defense task. When defense forces operate
outside the base boundary, the appropriate area of operations commander should
exercise tactical control over those forces for base defense purposes only.
Joint and coalition forces entering the base boundary should inform the base
defense operations center before they enter, and monitor the base defense
operations center’s communication net while operating in the area. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">19.10.6.3. The base defense operations center is
the command and control center for Integrated Defense operations during routine
and emergency operations. The defense force commander will establish a base
defense operations center to coordinate and direct, via their operational chain
of command, the tactical control of Integrated Defense forces and supporting
capabilities. All functions performed by central security control, the law
enforcement desk, or other security forces control centers will be performed by
the base defense operations center at all locations, home station and deployed.
</p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">19.11. Integrated
Defense Effects:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal29">19.11.1. Commanders execute Integrated Defense with the
objective of achieving nine desired effects based on the risk management
process described in paragraph 19.12. Those effects are: </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.11.1.1.<b class="calibre1">
Anticipate. </b>Anticipate threat intentions and actions (Intelligence
Preparation of the Operational Environment or crime trend analysis). </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.11.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Deter. </b>Deter
threat activity through active community policing (e.g., Eagle Eyes Program),
boundary and internal circulation control, controlled area marking, prudent
physical security measures. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.11.1.3.<b class="calibre1"> Detect. </b>Detect
threats through the use of lighting, Intrusion Detection Systems/Early Warning
Systems, closed-circuit television, etc. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.11.1.4.<b class="calibre1"> Assess. </b>Assess
to identify friend or foe using cameras, posted sentries, response forces,
integrated delivery system, etc. </p>

<p class="msonormal22">19.11.1.5.<b class="calibre1">
Warn. </b>Warn friendly forces of adversary activity through systems such as
mass notification, radio, public address, commander’s access channels, voice,
hand and arm signals, cellular telephones, instant messenger/short message
system texting, etc. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.11.1.6. <b class="calibre1">Defeat. </b>Defeat
threats through appropriate, progressive force application; coordinated
security force response; and integration of total force. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.11.1.7. <b class="calibre1">Delay. </b>Delay
adversaries using a layered application of barriers, obstacles, technology,
physical security measures, and forces (defense-in-depth). </p>

<p class="msonormal17">19.11.1.8. <b class="calibre1">Defend.
</b>Defend assets through threat- and effects-based planning that integrates
all friendly forces into a single, comprehensive plan by ensuring friendly
forces are trained and qualified on Arming and Use of Force. Also, ensure the
fighting positions are positioned where prudent based on risk analyses.<span class="calibre3">   </span></p>

<p class="msonormal10">19.11.1.9.<b class="calibre1"> Recover.
</b>Recover from adversarial events by applying effective command and control,
and developing and exercising comprehensive emergency management plan 10-2. </p>

<p class="msonormal29">19.11.2. These effects are not randomly applied to an
installation instead they are deliberately achieved through innovative and
reliable tactics, techniques, and procedures based on the Integrated Defense
risk management process and analysis. </p>

<p class="msonormal65">19.11.3. Ideally, defense forces receive such good
intelligence they are able to anticipate any and all threats. As this is
unlikely, attaining subsequent Integrated Defense desired effects is necessary.
For instance, it would be preferred to deter a threat; but if that does not
succeed, the next ideal effect would be to detect the threat. Once the threat
is detected, assessment by forces occurs. Friendly forces are then warned of
the threat and attempts are made to defeat, or eliminate, the threat. If the
threat cannot be defeated, it must be delayed. If not possible, defensive
measures must be taken to mitigate the effects of the threat. Recovery actions
are then implemented to consolidate and reorganize friendly forces and restore
operations. </p>

<p class="msonormal65">19.11.4.<b class="calibre1"> </b>The
intelligence fusion cell is an action group whereby the security forces staff
S-2 (intelligence) function coordinates with subject matter experts from the
Intelligence and Air Force Office of Special investigations communities to
collaborate and conduct intelligence preparation of the operational
environment. The goal is to leverage information and intelligence to support
the timely identification of indicators and warnings of emerging localized
threats. The intelligence fusion cell and the products of the fusion cells are
the primary information sources that directly support the defense force
commander in making immediate, proactive decisions for Integrated Defense
planning. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">19.11.5.<b class="calibre1"> </b>Intelligence
preparation of the battlefield/battlespace is an analytical methodology that
provides predictive intelligence to warfighters for use in planning and
executing operations. A systematic, four-step process, intelligence preparation
of the battlefield/battlespace’s bottom line intent is to support operational
decisions by providing analyzed information regarding the threat and
environment<i class="calibre2"> </i>in a given set of
circumstances. Intelligence preparation of the battlefield/battlespace is the
primary mechanism used to achieve the Integrated Defense desired effect of
“anticipate.” Furthermore, this analytical methodology is a continuous process,
enabling the commander to visualize: (1) the spectrum of friendly and
adversarial capabilities and weakness; (2) how they are affected by a variety
of environmental factors (for example; (3) weather, light, terrain, political
and social conditions), and (4) the logical predictions of the most likely and
most dangerous enemy course of action. </p>

<p class="msonormal60">19.11.6. Intelligence preparation of the
battlefield/battlespace is a continuous, four-part process: (1) defines the
operating environment; (2) describes the operating environment’s effects; (3)
evaluates the enemy; and (4) determines enemy course of action. The examples
below should be collected, analyzed, and applied to the tactical situation, as
a minimum. </p>

<p class="msonormal11">19.11.6.1. <b class="calibre1">Part 1.</b>
This part is comprised of comprehensive lists, dispositions, and capabilities
(offensive and defensive) of tasked friendly forces and other forces (for
example, host nation military and police forces, local, state, national
agencies [continental United States] and host nation [outside the continental
United States]) that contribute to the security of the installation and are
available to contribute during enemy surges (for example, increased force
protection conditions; terrain and weather (including light data); and
background data on the operating environment to include history, demographics,
socioeconomic data, religious groups, etc. Incident and emergency response
plans should also be identified in Part 1 for later consideration during
war-gaming conducted during Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace Part 4.
</p>

<p class="msonormal27"><span class="calibre3"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal22">19.11.6.2. <b class="calibre1">Part
2.</b> Analyze the data collected in Part 1 and describe how the factors affect
operations, equipment, and personnel. Whenever possible, use color-coded
stoplight charts that use green, yellow, and red coding to describe aspects of
operations or effects on personnel and equipment. For example, use mission
capable (green), partially mission capable (yellow), or non-mission capable
(red). </p>

<p class="msonormal17">19.11.6.3. <b class="calibre1">Part
3.</b> Collect historical data and existing intelligence analyses (for example,
Defense Intelligence Agency country reports or Air Force Office of Special
Investigations defense threat assessments of the operating environment, or
other reports about adversaries capable of operating in the geographic area of
concern. Consider the capabilities and weaknesses of each specific group
without assuming that all enemy forces collaborate. Consider and analyze the
effects of the operating environment (gathered in Part 1 and analyzed in Part
2) on each individual adversary. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">19.11.6.4. <b class="calibre1">Part
4.</b> Consider all data collected in the previous three parts and make logical
predictions of enemy course of actions. For each adversary assessed to be
present and capable, establish a prediction of the most likely and most
dangerous enemy course of actions. Then, through a process of war-gaming, establish
friendly courses of action that would effectively meet the commander’s intent
in defeating the predicted enemy course of actions.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">19.12. Integrated
Defense Risk Management Process.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal66">The integrated defense risk management process
provides installation commanders, integrated defense working groups, defense
force commanders and defense planners the ability to produce effects-based,
integrated defense plans by using a standardized model to identify risks and
develop risk management strategies. These strategies leverage finite resources
against adaptive threats to protect Air Force resources and personnel. The
integrated defense risk management process identifies at risk assets and aids
the integrated defense working groups in generating the criticality assessment
and the risk assessment<i class="calibre2"> </i>products. A
risk reduction decision based on a clear understanding of what is important,
the estimated threat, and how the asset might be damaged/destroyed, is then
developed through a logical process involving asset criticality assessment,
threat assessment, and vulnerability assessment. The integrated defense risk
management process analyzes an installation’s defense capabilities and provides
options to mitigate security risks, such as additional tactics, techniques, and
procedures, facility hardening, technology insertion, etc.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal67">19.12.1. The integrated defense risk management
process has four main components: (1) the risk assessment (as described above);
(2) the risk tolerance decision; (3) courses of action determination; and (4)
decision and implementation. All four components are directly influenced by the
evolving situation monitored through the Intelligence Preparation of the
Battlespace cycle. As such, new information, assessments, or decisions can be
assimilated into the integrated defense risk management process at any point,
which may alter the execution of Integrated Defense. These four components are
performed in the following seven steps: </p>

<p class="msonormal16">19.12.1.1. <b class="calibre1">Step
1: Develop the Criticality Assessment.</b> The criticality assessment
identifies assets worthy of protection whose loss or damage would have a
negative impact on the mission. Fundamental to this evaluation is the criteria
used to measure asset value or consequence of loss. Typical criteria include
mission criticality, impact on national defense, replace-ability, monetary
value, and relative (or intrinsic) value. </p>

<p class="msonormal13">19.12.1.2. <b class="calibre1">Step
2 and Step 3: Develop the Threat Assessment and Vulnerability Assessment.</b>
Threat multiplied by vulnerability determines the probability of loss (or
damage) of the asset. Threats are generally considered in terms of adversaries
and their tactics (for example, hackers, terrorists, criminals, protestors). To
know if adversaries pose a threat requires information about their operational
capability, intentions, activity, operating environment, and history.
Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that can be exploited by an adversary because of
inadequate security, lax or complacent personnel trends, vulnerable software or
hardware, and insufficient security policies or procedures. <b class="calibre1">Note:</b> Identification and evaluation of
existing threats and vulnerabilities are identified during Parts 1 through 3 of
the intelligence preparation of the operational environment process and may be
supplemented with other documents, such as antiterrorism vulnerability
assessments. </p>

<p class="msonormal68">19.12.1.3. <b class="calibre1">Step
4: Develop the Risk Assessment.</b> Once all previous assessments (criticality,
threat, and vulnerability) are completed and studied together to provide a
complete picture of the risks to an asset, the risk assessment can be
developed. A quantitative measurement of risk can be determined using the
following equation: risk = asset criticality multiplied by (threat multiplied
by vulnerability). </p>

<p class="msonormal11">19.12.1.4. <b class="calibre1">Step 5:
Risk Tolerance Decision. </b>At this point in the integrated defense risk
management process, the commander may have enough data to enable an informed
risk tolerance decision. But if information required to assess risks is deficient,
a command critical intelligence requirement should be developed or modified to
guide the intelligence community’s collection efforts. In today’s
resource-constrained environment, some risks must be accepted. However, some
risks cannot be tolerated due to their frequency or severity of consequence.
The installation commander’s intent for Integrated Defense will define the
level of tolerance. For risks exceeding the commander’s tolerance level,
countermeasures will be developed in the next step to render these risks more
acceptable. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">19.12.1.5. <b class="calibre1">Step
6: Present Countermeasure Courses of Action.</b> This step presents and
evaluates options for reducing risks. While risks can be alleviated by reducing
the asset’s criticality or mitigating the threat, eliminating vulnerabilities
is the area that can have the most impact on the installation commander’s risk
tolerance decision. At this time, the integrated defense working group can
develop various countermeasure courses of action to remove or mitigate
vulnerabilities and reduce unacceptable risks. An estimate of risk reduction
(i.e., benefit of risk reduction) can be prepared, along with showing the costs
associated with courses of action implementation. </p>

<p class="msonormal17">19.12.1.6. <b class="calibre1">Step
7: Decision and Implementation.</b> This is the most important step in the
integrated defense risk management process. During this step, the installation
commander selects the course of actions that will bring the risks within
his/her tolerance level, and directs resources to implement the decision. Closely
tied with step 7 is continuous assessment. This feedback loop posits that risk
management is not an event or tangible product, but rather a continuous cycle.
The implementation of countermeasure courses of action will sometimes change
the installation’s risk posture in unexpected or unintended ways. By
immediately identifying changes to the installation’s critical assets, threats
and vulnerabilities, decision makers can continually refine the installation’s
risk posture. </p>

<p class="msonormal62">19.12.2. Integrated Defense provides flexible
planning and execution opportunities that allow owners/users of protection
level 1 (PL1) non-nuclear, protection level 2 (PL2), protection level 3 (PL3),
and protection level 4 (PL4) assets to become actively involved in the defense
of their areas. </p>

<p class="msonormal67">19.12.3. The integrated defense risk management
process provides a more precise understanding of how the three risk factors of
threat, vulnerability and asset criticality relate to each other at each
installation. Understanding the relationships between these factors, as well as
continually analyzing the operating environment, assists commanders in
mitigating, accepting, and reducing risks to appropriate levels. </p>

<p class="msonormal69">19.12.4. Operationalize force protection
intelligence in order to maintain optimal situational awareness throughout the
base boundary and base security zone. This can be accomplished for the defense
force commanders through the development of a robust intelligence/information
collaboration, analysis, and fusion capability. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">19.13. Security
Protection Levels: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.13.1. <b class="calibre1">Protection
Level 1 (PL1). </b></p>

<p class="msonormal13">PL1 is assigned to those resources for which the
loss, theft, destruction, misuse, or compromise would result in unacceptable
mission degradation to the strategic capability of the United States or catastrophic
consequences for the nation. Examples of PL1 resources are nuclear weapons in
storage, mated to a delivery system, or in transit; designated command,
control, and communications facilities; and aircraft designated to transport
the President of the United States. PL1 security must result in the greatest
possible deterrence against hostile acts. This level of security will provide
maximum means to detect and defeat a hostile force before it is able to seize,
damage, or destroy resources.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.13.2. <b class="calibre1">Protection
Level 2 (PL2). </b></p>

<p class="msonormal14">PL2 is assigned to resources for which the loss,
theft, destruction, misuse, or compromise would result in significant mission
degradation to the war fighting capability of the United States. Examples of
PL2 resources are nonnuclear alert forces; designated space and launch systems;
expensive, few in number, or one-of-a-kind systems or facilities; and
intelligence-gathering systems. PL2 security must result in significant
deterrence against hostile acts. This level of security will ensure a
significant probability of detecting and defeating a hostile force before PL2
is able to seize, damage, or destroy resources.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal7">19.13.3. <b class="calibre1">Protection
Level 3 (PL3). </b></p>

<p class="msonormal58">PL3 is assigned to resources for which the loss,
theft, destruction, misuse, or compromise would result in mission degradation
to the United States warfighting capability. Examples of PL3 resources are
non-alert resources that can be generated to alert status, such as F-16
fighters; selected command, control, and communications facilities, systems,
and equipment; and non-launch-critical or non-unique space launch systems. PL3
security must result in a reasonable degree of deterrence against hostile acts.
This level of security ensures the capability to impede a hostile force and
limit damage to resources. </p>

Level 4 (PL4). </b></p>

<p class="msonormal70">PL4 is assigned to operational or mission support
resources that directly or indirectly support power projection assess and the
war fighting mission for which the loss, theft, destruction, misuse, or
compromise would adversely affect mission capability. Examples of PL4 resources
are facilities storing Category I, II, or III sensitive conventional arms,
ammunition, and explosives; fuels and liquid oxygen storage areas; and Air
Force accounting and finance vault areas. PL4 resources are secured by
containing them in controlled areas with owners/users being responsible for
security. Security forces provide response to threats. This level of security
must reduce the opportunity for theft of or damage to resources. </p>

<p class="msonormal2"><b class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">Section 19D—Antiterrorism Program
</i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">19.14. Air Force
Antiterrorism Program Defined. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal71">The program seeks to deter or limit the effects of terrorist
acts against the Air Force by giving guidance on collecting and disseminating
timely threat information, providing training to all Air Force members,
developing comprehensive plans to deter and counter terrorist incidents,
allocating funds and personnel, and implementing antiterrorism measures. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">19.15. Antiterrorism
Training and Exercises. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal65">At least annually, commanders conduct comprehensive
field and staff training to exercise antiterrorism plans, to include
antiterrorism physical security measures, Continuity of Operations Program,
Critical Asset Risk Management and emergency management plans. Antiterrorism
training and exercises shall be afforded the same emphasis as combat task
training and executed with the intent to identify shortfalls affecting the
protection of personnel, assets and information against terrorist attack and
subsequent antiterrorism consequence management efforts. Antiterrorism, an area
of responsibility specific training, particularly pre-deployment training,
should include terrorism scenarios specific to the deployed location and based
on current enemy Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, and lessons learned.
Additionally, the current baseline through force protection condition Charlie
measures shall be exercised annually at installations and selfsupported<b class="calibre1"> </b>separate facilities. </p>

<p class="msonormal19"><b class="calibre1">19.16. Threat
Information Collection and Analysis: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">19.16.1. Commanders shall task the appropriate
organizations under their command to gather, analyze, and disseminate terrorism
threat information, as appropriate. To support the commander, the Services should
continuously ensure forces are trained to maximize the use of information
derived from law enforcement liaison, intelligence, and counterintelligence
processes and procedures. This includes intelligence procedures for handling
priority intelligence requests for in-transit units as well as implementation
of procedures to conduct intelligence preparation of the space and mission
analysis. </p>

<p class="msonormal72">19.16.2. Identifying the potential terrorism threat to
Department of Defense personnel and assets and how the hazards affect the
mission is the first step in developing an effective antiterrorism program.
Commanders at all levels who understand the threat can assess their ability to
prevent, survive, and prepare to respond to an attack. A terrorism threat
assessment requires the identification of a full range of known or estimated
terrorist threat capabilities (including the use or threat of use of chemical,
biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosives and weapons of mass
destruction). In addition to tasking appropriate agencies to collect
information, commanders at all levels can and should encourage personnel under
their command to report information on individuals, events, or situations that
could pose a threat to the security of Department of Defense personnel,
families, facilities, and resources. </p>

<p class="msonormal65">19.16.3. At the strategic level, the Deputy Chief
of Staff for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (Air Force/A2) and
the Director for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Strategy,
Doctrine and Force Development (Air Force/A2D)<b class="calibre1"> </b>is responsible for ensuring the timely collection processing,
analysis, production, and dissemination of foreign intelligence, current
intelligence, and national-level intelligence information concerning terrorist
activities, terrorist organizations, and force protection issues. These efforts
will focus on, but not be limited to, transnational and statesponsored entities
and organizations. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations is the lead
Air Force agency for collection, investigation, analysis, and response for
threats arising from terrorists, criminal activity and foreign intelligence and
security services. Air Force Office of Special Investigations is primarily
focused on countering adversary intelligence collection activities against
United States forces and will act as the Air Force single point of contact with
federal, state, local and foreign nation law enforcement, counterintelligence,
and security agencies. </p>

<p class="msonormal23"><b class="calibre1">19.17.</b> <b class="calibre1">Department of Defense Random Antiterrorism
Measures Program.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal65">Installation commanders shall develop and implement
a random antiterrorism measures program that will include all units on the
installation. The intent of the random antiterrorism measures program is to
provide random, multiple security measures that consistently change the look of
an installation’s antiterrorism program. Random antiterrorism measures
introduce uncertainty to an installation’s overall force protection program to
defeat surveillance attempts and make random antiterrorism measures difficult
for a terrorist to accurately predict our actions. The random antiterrorism
measures program shall be included in antiterrorism plans and tie directly with
all force protection condition (including force protection condition normal) to
ensure continuity and standardization should threats require Air Force-wide
implementation. Random antiterrorism measures times for implementation,
location, and duration shall be regularly changed to avoid predictability.
Random antiterrorism measures execution shall be broad based and involve all
units and personnel. Antiterrorism officers are required to monitor, track, and
analyze random antiterrorism measures implementation efforts. Installation
commanders will develop procedures to ensure random antiterrorism measures are
being conducted and reported to the Antiterrorism officers.<b class="calibre1"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal50"><b class="calibre1">19.18. General
Antiterrorism Personal Protection. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal73">Always keep a low profile and avoid publicity. Avoid going
out in large groups; be unpredictable. Vary daily routines to and from home and
work. Be alert for anything suspicious or out of place. Avoid giving
unnecessary personal details to anyone unless their identity can be verified.
Be alert to strangers who are on government property for no apparent reason.
Refuse to meet with strangers outside your workplace. Always advise associates
or family members of your destination and anticipated time of arrival when
leaving the office or home. Report unsolicited contacts to authorities and do
not open doors to strangers. Memorize key telephone numbers. Be cautious about
giving out information regarding family travel places or security measures.
When overseas, learn and practice a few key phrases in the local language. </p>

<p class="msonormal50"><b class="calibre1">19.19. Home and Family
Security.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal62">Your spouses and children should always practice
basic precautions for their personal security. Familiarize your family with the
local terrorist threat, and regularly review protective measures and
techniques. Ensure everyone in the family knows what to do in any type of
emergency. Restrict the possession of house keys. Lock all entrances at night,
including the garage. Keep the house locked, even if you are at home. Destroy
all envelopes or other items that show your name, rank, or other personal
information. Remove names and rank from mailboxes. Watch for unfamiliar
vehicles cruising or parked frequently in the area, particularly if one or more
occupants remain in the vehicle for extended periods.<span class="calibre3">  </span></p>

<p class="msonormal74"><b class="calibre1">19.20. Telephone
Security. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal75">Post emergency telephone numbers
on the telephone and preprogram telephone numbers for security forces, local
police, fire department, hospitals, and ambulances. Do not answer your
telephone with your name and grade. Report all threatening phone calls to security
officials and the telephone company. Attempt to ascertain any pertinent
information about the caller. </p>

<p class="msonormal29">For example, background noise, accent, nationality, or
location. </p>

<p class="msonormal74"><b class="calibre1">19.21. Travel
Overseas. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal69">When traveling overseas, travel in small groups and
try to be inconspicuous when using public transportation and facilities. Dress,
conduct, and mannerisms should not attract attention and be generally similar
to that worn by the people in the area. Avoid spontaneous gatherings or
demonstrations; stay away from known trouble. Know emergency telephone numbers,
local dialing instructions, and ensure family members carry a list of telephone
numbers with them at all times. </p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre1">19.22. Suspicious
Packages or Mail. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal67">Look for an unusual or unknown place of origin; no
return address; excessive amount of postage; abnormal size or shape; protruding
strings; aluminum foil; wires; misspelled words; differing return address and
postmark; handwritten labels; unusual odor; unusual or unbalanced weight;
springiness in the top or bottom; inflexibility; crease marks; discoloration or
oily stains; incorrect titles or title with no name; excessive security
material; ticking, beeping, or other sounds; or special instruction markings,
such as “personal, rush, do not delay, or confidential” on any packages or mail
received. Additionally, be vigilant for evidence of powder or other
contaminants. Never cut tape, strings, or other wrappings on a suspect package.
If the package has been moved, place the package in a plastic bag to prevent any
leakage of contents. If handling mail suspected of containing chemical or
biological contaminants, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. Report
suspicious mail immediately and make a list of personnel who were in the room
when the suspicious envelope or package was identified. </p>

<p class="msonormal76"><b class="calibre1">19.23. Ground Transportation Security. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal76">Criminal and terrorist acts
against individuals usually occur outside the home and after the victim’s
habits have been established. Your most predictable habit is the route you
travel from home to your place of duty or to commonly frequented local
facilities. Always check for tampering of the interior and exterior of your
vehicle before entering the vehicle. Also check the tires and trunk for
fingerprints or smudges. If you detect something out of the ordinary, do not
touch anything. Immediately contact the local authorities. When overseas,
select a plain car. Avoid using government vehicles when possible. Do not
display decals with military affiliations and do not openly display military equipment.
Keep your doors locked at all times. Do not let someone you do not know direct
you to a specific taxi. Ensure taxi is licensed and has safety equipment (seat
belts at a minimum). Ensure face of driver and picture on license are the same.
Travel with a companion. </p>

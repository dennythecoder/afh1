<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre2">14.3. Overview. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">Like many things, good communication requires
preparation. There are seven steps that will help every Airman become a better
communicator, both in written correspondence and in speaking abilities (Figure
14.2). The first four steps lay the groundwork for the drafting process.<b class="calibre2"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal34"><b class="calibre2">5. </b>Draft<b class="calibre2"> </b>Most Air Force
writing or speaking is either to direct, inform, <b class="calibre2">6. </b>Edit<b class="calibre2"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal35">persuade, or inspire. Your task is to think about
the message you <b class="calibre2">7. </b>Fight for

send (the what) and make some sort of determination what your purpose is (the

Determining Purpose </b></p>

<p class="msonormal37"><b class="calibre2">To Direct—</b><i class="calibre3">Directive communication</i> is generally
used to pass on information describing actions you expect to be carried out by
your audience. The emphasis in directive communication is clear, concise
directions and expectations of your audience.<span class="calibre15"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal38"><span class="calibre16"><span class="calibre17"><img src="image009.png" v:shapes="Group_x0020_874921 Shape_x0020_112029 Picture_x0020_112030 Picture_x0020_112076" class="calibre18"/></span></span><b class="calibre2">To Inform—</b>The goal of <i class="calibre3">informative communication</i> is to pass on
information to the audience. The emphasis in informative communication is
clear, direct communication with accurate and adequate information tailored to
the education and skill levels of the audience. Audience feedback and
interaction may be appropriate in some situations to make sure they “got the
message.” </p>

<p class="msonormal39"><b class="calibre2">To Persuade—</b><i class="calibre3">Persuasive Communication</i> is typically
used when you are trying to “sell” your audience on a new idea, new policy, new
product or a change in current operations. </p>

<p class="msonormal40"><b class="calibre2">To Inspire—</b>One
final purpose for writing or speaking that doesn’t get much attention, but is
frequently used in the military is to <i class="calibre3">inspire</i>.
The emphasis in inspirational communication is delivery, a thorough knowledge
of your topic and likewise your audience. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.4.2. <b class="calibre2">Draft the
Purpose Statement.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal41">One way to make sure you are clear on your objective is to
write a <i class="calibre3">purpose statement</i>, which is
one sentence that captures the essence of what you are trying to do—your
“bottom line.” Developing a clear purpose statement will: </p>

<p class="msonormal42">14.9.2.1. Help you FOCUS as you develop your
communication. </p>

<p class="msonormal43">14.9.2.2. Help your audience <i class="calibre3">focus</i> when you deliver your message. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.4.3.<b class="calibre2"> Know Yourself.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal43">Realizing your own strengths and weaknesses will help you
meet your communication goals. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.4.4.<b class="calibre2"> Know Your
Organization.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal44">In the military, we rarely act or speak in a vacuum. Often
we represent our organization, unit, or functional area and must understand
them and accommodate their views, capabilities, or concerns in our
communications. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.4.5.<b class="calibre2"> Know Your
Audience.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal45">The receiving audience falls into one of four
sub-categories. Depending on the type of communication and coordination needed,
you may or may not deal with each one of these: </p>

<p class="msonormal46">14.4.5.1. Primary receiver—the person you directly
communicate with, either verbally or in writing. </p>

<p class="msonormal44">14.4.5.2. Secondary receiver—people you indirectly
communicate with through the primary receivers. </p>

<p class="msonormal47">14.4.5.3. Key decision makers—the most powerful
members of the audience; the ones that really make the decisions. Knowing who
they are will help focus your attention and potentially your delivery in larger
briefings and certain written communication. </p>

<p class="msonormal48">14.4.5.4. Gatekeepers—people in the chain who
typically review the communication before the communication reaches the
intended audience. Knowing who they are and what their expectations are can
save you embarrassment and help ensure your success in the long run. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.4.6.<b class="calibre2"> Succeed With
Your Audience. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal45">Some tips are: </p>

<p class="msonormal49">14.4.6.1. <b class="calibre2">Rank.</b>
Differences in military rank can be a real barrier to communication in the Air
Force. Many of us become tongue-tied when communicating with those senior in
rank, and cursory or impatient with those who are junior in rank. We must
constantly remind ourselves we are all communicative equals and should strive
to be candid, direct, and respectful with everyone. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.4.6.2. <b class="calibre2">Jargon.</b>
Tailor to your audience<b class="calibre2">. </b>Do not
overestimate the knowledge and expertise of your readers, but do not talk down
to them either. Be careful with excessive use of career-field specific jargon
and acronyms. </p>

<p class="msonormal50">14.4.6.3. <b class="calibre2">Be
Inclusive.</b> Remember our diverse force<b class="calibre2">.</b>
Sometimes we inadvertently exclude members of our audience by falling into
communication traps involving references to race, religion, ethnicity, or sex.
Remember this concept when designing your visual support. Knowing your audience
and adhering to good taste and sensitivity will keep you in check.<b class="calibre2"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal49">14.4.6.4. <b class="calibre2">Tone.</b>
This is not just what you say, but how you say it<b class="calibre2">. </b>Closely tied to the purpose of your communication is the tone you
take with your audience. Speakers have gestures, voice, and movements to help
them communicate. Writers only have words on paper. How many times have you
seen colleagues get bent out of shape over a misunderstood e-mail? Why? Because
the nonverbal signals available during face-to-face communication are absent.
Recognize this disadvantage in written communication and pay close attention to
the tone. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.4.6.5. <b class="calibre2">Courtesy.</b>
The first rule of writing is to be polite. Forego anger, criticism, and
sarcasm—strive to be reasonable and persuasive. Try not to deliberately
embarrass someone and avoid with a more tactful choice of words. </p>

<p class="msonormal51">14.4.6.6. <b class="calibre2">Make
it Personal.</b> When appropriate, use pronouns to create instant rapport, show
concern, and keep your reader involved. Using pronouns also keeps your writing
from being monotonous, dry, and abstract. The pronouns you will probably use
the most are you, yours, we, us, and our. Use I, me, and my sparingly. One rule
of business writing is to put your audience first; so, when possible, avoid
using I<i class="calibre3"> </i>as the first word of an
opening sentence and avoid starting two sentences in a row with we or I unless
you are trying to hammer home a point. </p>

<p class="msonormal52">14.4.6.7. <b class="calibre2">Formal.
</b>(“To be, or not to be”) versus Informal (“hey dude”). Different
communication situations require different levels of formality. The informal
tone is more like a conversation between you and your reader and is
characterized by clear, direct, active language. In today’s Air Force, most of
your writing will be informal, though ceremonies and awards may require more
elaborate (formal) language. Whether your tone is formal or informal, you still
need to follow the accepted rules of grammar.<span class="calibre15"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal53">14.4.6.8. <b class="calibre2">Be
Positive. </b>To cultivate a positive tone give praise where praise is due,
acknowledge acceptance before<span class="calibre1">    </span>focusing
on additional improvements, and express criticism in the form of helpful
questions, suggestions, requests, recommendations, or clear directives rather
than accusations. Your audience always appreciates sincerity and honesty.<span class="calibre15"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre2">14.5. Step 2<i class="calibre3">—</i>Research Your Topic. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal54">Whether your goal is to persuade or inform, you
will need more than fancy words to win the day—you will need substance as well
as style. Once you’re clear on your purpose and audience (Step 1), you will
need to research your topic to uncover information that will support your
communication goals. Before you begin the research, refer to the five
approaches to researching below for the best method for accomplishing researching.
</p>

<p class="msonormal55">14.5.1. <b class="calibre2">Approach
1</b>. Review purpose and scope of the overall project. Sometimes your purpose
and scope will evolve as you learn more about the topic, and you may need to do
some preliminary research just to get smart enough to scope out the effort. </p>

<p class="msonormal56">14.5.2. <b class="calibre2">Approach 2.
</b>Assign a deadline as you can easily get lost in the research process. Don’t
do an outstanding job of data retrieval, then a marginal job on the
presentation because you ran out of time. </p>

<p class="msonormal56">14.5.3. <b class="calibre2">Approach 3.
</b>Ask the boss. Even if you can eventually find the answer on your own, save
some time by asking your supervisor for suggestions on where to start. </p>

<p class="msonormal57">14.5.4. <b class="calibre2">Approach
4. </b>Determine what is known. Before you look for answers outside yourself,
look in the mirror. You may already have valuable knowledge about an assigned
research project. When relying on personal knowledge, be sure to identify and
guard against any biases you may have. </p>

<p class="msonormal58">14.5.5. <b class="calibre2">Approach
5. </b>Determine where to look for information. Coworkers and base personnel
are easy because you can meet with them face-to-face. Office files and
references in paper form and on your computer network may be valuable sources
of information. Finally, the internet and library offer an unlimited supply of
information. </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre2">14.6. Step 3<i class="calibre3">—</i>Support Your Ideas. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal59">Once you have researched your topic and collected
information, you need to figure out how to use what you have found to meet your
communication goals. Individual pieces of evidence are used to build your
argument. When identifying some common types of evidence, they may include: </p>

<p class="msonormal60">14.6.1. <b class="calibre2">Definition.</b>
A definition<b class="calibre2"> </b>is a precise meaning or
significance of a word or phrase. </p>

<p class="msonormal60">14.6.2. <b class="calibre2">Testimony.</b>
A testimony<b class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3"> </i></b>uses the comments of recognized authorities to support your
claim. These comments are sometimes direct quotations or paraphrases, but
direct quotations tend to carry more weight with listeners or readers. </p>

<p class="msonormal61">14.6.3. <b class="calibre2">Statistics.
</b>The use of statistics<b class="calibre2"> </b>provides a
summary of data that allows your audience to better interpret quantitative
information. Statistics can be very persuasive and provide excellent support if
handled competently. Keep them simple and easy to read and understand. Also,
remember to round off your statistics whenever possible and document the exact
source of your statistics. </p>

<p class="msonormal28">14.6.4. <b class="calibre2">Example</b>.
An example<i class="calibre3"> </i>is a specific instance
chosen to represent a larger fact in order to clarify an abstract idea or
support a claim. Good examples must be appropriate, brief and attention
arresting. Quite often they are presented in groups of two or three for impact.
</p>

<p class="msonormal62">14.6.5. <b class="calibre2">Fact.</b>
A fact is a noncontroversial piece of data that can be confirmed by observation
or by talking to communally accepted authorities. Be careful to distinguish
facts from inferences, and handle inferences you would like to use in your
research as testimony, not fact. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.6.6. <b class="calibre2">Explanation:</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.6.6.1. <b class="calibre2">Analysis.</b>
The analysis is the separation of a whole into smaller pieces for further
studies; clarifying a complex issue by examining one piece at a time. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.6.6.2. <b class="calibre2">Comparison
and Contrast.</b> Use comparison to dramatize similarities between two objects
or situations, and contrast to emphasize differences. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.6.6.3. <b class="calibre2">Description.</b>
A description is to tell about something in detail, to paint a picture with
words, typically more personal and subjective than a definition. </p>

<p class="msonormal63"><b class="calibre2">14.7.</b> <b class="calibre2">Step 4<i class="calibre3">—</i>Organize
and Outline. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal54">Select a pattern that enables you and your readers
to move systematically and logically through your ideas from beginning to
conclusion. Some of the most common organizational patterns are listed below.
Your purpose, the needs of your audience, and the nature of your material will
influence your choice of pattern. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.7.1.<b class="calibre2"> Topical.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal42">Use the topical format to present groups of ideas,
objects, or events by categories. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.7.2.<b class="calibre2"> Compare or
Contrast.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal45">Use the compare and contrast style when you need to
discuss similarities and differences between topics, concepts, or ideas. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.7.3.<b class="calibre2"> Chronological.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal45">When using the chronological pattern, you discuss events,
problems, or processes in the sequence of time in which occurrences take place
or should take place (past to present or present to future). </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.7.4.<b class="calibre2"> Sequential.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal42">A step-by-step approach, sequential is similar to the
chronological pattern. Use this approach to describe a sequence of steps
necessary to complete a technical procedure or process. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.7.5.<b class="calibre2"> Spatial or
Geographical.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal49">When using spatial or geographical pattern, you
will start at some point in space and proceed in sequence to other points. This
pattern is based on a directional strategy—north to south, east to west,
clockwise or counterclockwise, bottom to top, above and below. </p>

<p class="msonormal64"><span class="calibre1"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.7.6.<b class="calibre2"> Problem and
Solution.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal65">Use the problem and solution pattern to identify
and describe a problem and one or more possible solutions, or an issue and
possible techniques for resolving the issue. Discuss all facets of the problem,
such as origin, characteristics, and impact. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.7.7.<b class="calibre2"> Reasoning and
Logic.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal45">State an opinion and then make your case by providing
support for your position. Use the reasoning and logic pattern when your
mission is to present research that will lead your audience down the path to
your point of view. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.7.8.<b class="calibre2"> Cause and
Effect.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal45">Use the cause and effect pattern to show how one or more
ideas, actions, or conditions lead to other ideas, actions, or conditions. </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre2">14.8. Step 5<i class="calibre3">—</i>Draft. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal66">A draft is not the finished product, and each sentence
does not have to be polished and perfect. The focus is to get your ideas down
on paper. Do not obsess about grammar, punctuation, spelling, and word
choice—this all comes later. You do not have to fix every mistake you see. By
periodically checking your outline, you are less likely to lose focus and
include irrelevant information. Break up your draft into a three-part
structure—introduction, body, and conclusion. </p>

<p class="msonormal67">14.8.1.<b class="calibre2"> Introduction.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal68">The introduction captures your audience’s
attention, establishes rapport, and announces your purpose. Therefore, the
introduction sets the stage and tone for your message and the direction you
plan to take the audience. A typical introduction has three components:
stage-setting remarks, a purpose statement, and an overview. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.8.1.1. Stage-setting remarks sets the tone, captures
the audience’s attentions, and encourages the audience to read further.
Stage-setting remarks are optional and can be omitted in very short messages. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.8.1.2. The purpose statement is the one sentence you
would keep if you had only one. Moreover, the purpose statement specifically
states your purpose, thesis, or main point. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.8.1.3. The overview clearly presents your main points,
previews your paragraph sequence, and ties your main points to your purpose. </p>

<p class="msonormal60">14.8.2.<b class="calibre2"> Body.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal69">This is the heart of your message and includes the
main ideas about your subject and supporting details under each main idea. The
body, depending on the purpose and subject, will typically consist of several
paragraphs. As a general rule a separate paragraph is formed for each main
idea. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.8.3.<b class="calibre2"> Conclusion.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal65">The conclusion is the last and often neglected part
of well-arranged communication. An effective conclusion often summarizes the
main points discussed in the body, and leaves the reader with a sense of
closure. Conclude your communication with positive statements based on your
preceding discussion and avoid bringing up new information. The introduction
and conclusion should balance each other without being identical. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.8.4.<b class="calibre2"> Effective
Paragraphs:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal70">14.8.4.1. Paragraphs are the primary vehicles for
developing ideas. They group related ideas into single units of thought,
separate one unit of thought from another, and alert readers that the writer is
shifting to another phase of the subject. </p>

<p class="msonormal69">14.8.4.2. Each paragraph contains a topic sentence,
preferably at the beginning, that prepares the reader for the rest of the
paragraph and provides a point of focus for support details, facts, figures,
and examples. Use supporting ideas to prove, clarify, illustrate, and develop
your main point. The objective is to help the readers see the paragraphs as
integrated units rather than a mere collection of sentences. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.8.5.<b class="calibre2"> Plain
Language. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal57">Prepare all Air Force correspondence using plain
language. Plain language means using logical organization; common, everyday
words (except for necessary technical terms); “you” and other pronouns; the
active voice; and short sentences. </p>

<p class="msonormal64"><span class="calibre1"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.8.6.<b class="calibre2"> Transitions.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal71">One way to make sure your paragraphs flow together,
both internally and externally, is by using transitions in the form of words,
phrases, or sentences. Internal transitions are used within a sentence to
improve the flow, while external transitions are used to link separate
paragraphs together within the body of the communication. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.8.7.<b class="calibre2"> Effective
Sentences.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal45">To draft clear and concise sentences, choose clear and
concise words and phrases to make up your sentences. There are three
considerations to make when drafting sentences: active voice, smothered verbs,
and parallelism. </p>

<p class="msonormal72">14.8.7.1. <b class="calibre2">Write
Actively.</b> The active voice shows the subject as the actor, reaches out to
the reader and gets to the point quickly with fewer words. Whereas the passive
voice shows the subject as receiver of the action. </p>

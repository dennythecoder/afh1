TODAY’S AIR FORCE </b></p>

<p class="msonormal3"><b class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">Section 14A—Overview </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre2">14.1. Introduction: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal5">14.1.1. Your success as a military leader depends on
your ability to think critically and creatively; it is also crucial to
communicate your intentions and decisions to others. The ability to communicate
clearly—to write, speak, and actively listen—greatly impacts your capacity to
inform, teach, motivate, mentor, and lead those around you. Communicating your
intent and ideas so that others understand your message and act on it is one of
the primary qualities of leadership. </p>

<p class="msonormal6">14.1.2. Communication is the process of sharing ideas,
information, and messages with others. In the Air Force, most communication
involves speaking and writing. Any communication can be broken into three
parts: the sender, the message, and the audience. For communication to be
successful, the audience must not only receive the message, but the audience
must interpret the message in the way the sender intended. </p>

<p class="msonormal7">14.1.3. This chapter begins by examining the
fundamentals of better communication, both written and spoken. Then the chapter
focuses on written communications in general terms and outlines certain methods
that can be used to improve writing style. Finally, it provides an overview and
samples of the types of correspondence the noncommissioned officer (NCO) is
likely to deal with in daily activities. This is not an exhaustive text and is
meant as an overview, consult AFH 33-337 <i class="calibre3">The
Tongue and Quill.</i> </p>

Seven Steps for Effective Communication </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal4"><b class="calibre2">14.2. Principles of
Effective Communication. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal8">Everyone must understand what
makes communication succeed and fail. Most mistakes are caused by forgetting
one of the five principles of good communication. This section addresses the
five core principles, focused, organized, clear, understanding, and supported
(FOCUS) (Figure 14.1). </p>

<p class="msonormal10">14.2.1.<b class="calibre2"> Focused.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal11">The first hallmark of good communication is that the
communication is focused. The sender has a clear idea of the purpose and
objective, locks on target, and stays on track. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">14.2.2.<b class="calibre2"> Organized.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal11">Good organization means your material is presented in a
logical, systematic manner. When writing or speaking is not well organized,
audiences become easily confused or impatient and may stop reading or
listening. Even if you are providing useful, relevant information, your
audience may underestimate the value of the information and your credibility. </p>

<p class="msonormal12">14.2.3.<b class="calibre2"> Clear.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal11">This principle covers two interrelated ideas. First, to
communicate clearly, we need to understand the rules of language; how to spell
and pronounce words, and how to assemble and punctuate sentences. Second, we
should get to the point, not hide our ideas in a maze of words. </p>

<p class="msonormal10">14.2.4.<b class="calibre2"> Understanding.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal13">Understanding their current knowledge, views, and level of
interest in the topic helps when sharing ideas with others. Understanding what

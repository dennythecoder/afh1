  <body lang="EN-US" class="calibre">
<div class="wordsection2">
<p class="msonormal45">An effective voice drives home ideas or information. The
speaker has control over such things as rate, volume, pitch, and pause. The
techniques used to create interest and help increase communication include: </p>

<p class="msonormal142">14.13.1.1.<b class="calibre2">
Rate.</b> There is no correct rate of speed for every speech; however, consider
this: the average processing rate is 500 words per minute and the average
speaking rate is 180 words a minute. Speak too slowly, and the audience will
lose interest; on the other hand, speak too fast and the speech will become
unintelligible. The key is to vary the rate of speech to hold the audience’s
attention and to add emphasis. </p>

<p class="msonormal143">14.13.1.2.<b class="calibre2">
Volume.</b> Another verbal technique that can give emphasis to a speech is
volume. If possible, check out the room to know how loudly you must talk,
remembering you will need to talk louder with a crowd since the sound is
absorbed. Remember your voice will carry further when the room is empty versus
full. If the audience must strain to hear you, they will eventually tune you
out from utter exhaustion. Speak louder or softer to emphasize a point— a
softer level or lower volume is often the more effective way to achieve
emphasis. </p>

<p class="msonormal144">14.13.1.3.<b class="calibre2">
Pitch.</b> The use of notes, higher or lower, in the voice is called pitch.
Speakers use pitch changes in vowels, words, or entire sentences. Use a
downward (high to low) inflection in a sentence for an air of certainty, and an
upward (low to high) inflection for an air of uncertainty. Variety in speech
pitch helps to avoid monotone and to capture the listener’s attention. </p>

<p class="msonormal145">14.13.1.4.<b class="calibre2">
Pause.</b> The pause technique gives the speaker time to catch his or her
breath and the audience time to collect the speaker’s ideas. The pause
technique serves the same function as punctuation in writing. Short pauses
usually divide points within a sentence and longer pauses note the ends of
sentences. The speaker can also use longer pauses for breaks from one main
point to another, from the body to the conclusion of the speech, or to set off
an important point worthy of short reflection. </p>

<p class="msonormal146">14.13.1.5.<b class="calibre2">
Articulation and Pronunciation.</b> Articulation is the art of expressing words
distinctly. Pronunciation is the ability to say words correctly. People can
articulate their thoughts and still mispronounce words while doing so.
Unfortunately (and unfairly), many people consider word pronunciation or
mispronunciation a direct reflection on the speaker’s intelligence. If you are
not sure of the pronunciation, consult a current dictionary. </p>

<p class="msonormal72">14.13.1.6.<b class="calibre2"> Length.</b>
The length of a presentation is crucial. A key rule in verbal communication is
short and sweet. </p>

<p class="msonormal42">Be prepared, know what you want to say, then say what you
want to say with your purpose and audience in mind. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.13.2.<b class="calibre2"> Nonverbal
Communication. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal69">Actually presenting the talk is the hardest part
for many people. How can body movement, voice, and sincerity enhance a
presentation? Communications experts tell us that over half of our meaning may
be communicated nonverbally. Although nonverbal meaning is communicated through
vocal cues, much meaning is carried by the physical behaviors of eye contact,
body movement, and gestures. </p>

<p class="msonormal57">14.13.2.1. <b class="calibre2">Eye
Contact.</b> This is one of the most important factors in nonverbal communication.
Nothing will enhance the delivery more than effective eye contact with the
audience. Eye contact is important for three reasons. First, lets the listeners
know the speaker is interested in them. Second, effective eye contact allows
you to receive nonverbal feedback from the audience. Third, effective eye
contact enhances the credibility of the speaker. </p>

<p class="msonormal147">14.13.2.2. <b class="calibre2">Body
Movement.</b> Good body movement is important because body movement catches the
eye of the listener. Effective body movement can be described as free and
purposeful. While not essential, the speaker should feel free to move around in
front of the audience. When looking at note cards, speakers should drop their
eyes, not their head. </p>

<p class="msonormal71">14.13.2.3.<b class="calibre2">
Gestures.</b> Gestures are the purposeful use of the hands, arms, shoulders,
and head to reinforce what is being said. Effective gestures are both natural
and purposeful. Fidgeting with a paperclip, rearranging or shuffling papers,
and constantly clicking a pen are distracting to the audience. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.13.3.<b class="calibre2"> Delivery
Formats. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal45">Your approach to delivery of the spoken message is usually
affected by several factors, including the time you have to prepare and the
nature of the message. Three common delivery formats are: </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.13.3.1.<b class="calibre2">
Impromptu.</b> Speaking when we respond during a meeting or “take the floor” at
a conference. Speakers may do this when they have to speak publicly without
warning or with only a few moments’ notice. To do impromptu speaking well
requires a great amount of self-confidence, mastery of the subject, and the
ability to “think on your feet.” A superb impromptu speaker has achieved the
highest level in verbal communications. </p>

<p class="msonormal97">14.13.3.2. <b class="calibre2">Prepared
(Formally Extemporaneous).</b> Prepared speaking or briefing refers to those
times when we have ample opportunity to prepare. This does not mean the person
writes a script and memorizes the script, but prepared delivery does require a
thorough outline with careful planning and practicing. The specific words and
phrases used at the time of delivery, however, are spontaneous and sound very
natural.<b class="calibre2"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal47">14.13.3.3.<b class="calibre2">
Manuscript.</b> A manuscript briefing is the delivery format that requires
every word spoken to be absolutely perfect. The disadvantage of a manuscript
briefing is that people demonstrate a tendency to lack spontaneity, lack eye
contact, and they stand behind the lectern with their script. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.13.4.<b class="calibre2"> Types of
Speaking. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal45">Types of speaking used in the Air Force include briefing,
teaching lecture, and formal speech. </p>

<p class="msonormal148">14.13.4.1. <b class="calibre2">Briefing.</b>
The best military briefings are concise and factual. Their major purpose is to
inform listeners about a mission, operation, or concept. Some briefings direct
or enable listeners to perform a procedure or carry out instructions. Other
briefings advocate, persuade, or support a certain solution and lead the
audience to accept the briefing. Every good briefing has the qualities of
accuracy, brevity, and clarity. Accuracy and clarity characterize all good
speaking, but brevity distinguishes the briefing from other types of speaking.
A briefer must be brief and to the point and should anticipate some of the
questions that may arise. If a briefer cannot answer a question, he or she
should not attempt an off-the-top-of-the-head answer. Instead, he or she should
admit to not knowing the answer and offer to provide the answer later. </p>

<p class="msonormal69">14.13.4.2. <b class="calibre2">Teaching
Lecture.</b> The teaching lecture is the method of instruction most often used in
the Air Force. As the name implies, the primary purpose of a teaching lecture
is to teach students about a given subject. Teaching lectures are either formal
or informal. Formal lectures are generally one-way with no verbal participation
by the students. Informal lectures are usually presented to smaller audiences
and allow for verbal interaction between the instructor and students. </p>

<p class="msonormal97">14.13.4.3.<b class="calibre2">
Formal Speech.</b> A formal speech generally has one of three basic purposes:
to inform, persuade, or entertain. The informative speech is a narration
concerning a specific topic but does not involve a sustained effort to teach.
Orientation talks and presentations at commander’s call are examples of
informative speeches. The persuasive speech is designed to move an audience to
believe in or take action on the topic presented. Recruiting speeches to high
school graduating classes and court-martial summations are speeches primarily
developed to persuade. The entertaining speech gives enjoyment to the audience.
The speaker often relies on humor and vivid language to entertain listeners. A
speech to entertain is appropriate at a Dining-Out. </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre2">14.14. Effective
Listening: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal149">14.14.1. <b class="calibre2">Understanding
the Listening Process. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal65">To better understand the listening process, let’s
begin by distinguishing between hearing and listening. Hearing occurs when your
ears pick up sound waves being transmitted by a speaker or some other source.
Hearing requires a source of sound and an ear capable of perceiving sound.
Hearing does not require the conscious decoding of information. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.14.2. <b class="calibre2">Listening To
Make Sense. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal150">Listening, on the other hand, involves making sense
out of what is being transmitted. Listening involves not only hearing, it involves
attending to and considering what is heard. Effective listening is an active
process. Active listening involves exerting energy and responding appropriately
in order to hear, comprehend, evaluate, and remember the message. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.14.3. <b class="calibre2">The
Importance of Listening.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal65">Listening is especially important in the Air Force,
and actually in any military unit. Success is literally a matter of life and
death, and we routinely maintain/operate equipment worth millions of dollars.
Receiving, comprehending, and remembering spoken information is critical. Any
miscommunication is potentially catastrophic. Effective listening helps to
build the trust and mutual respect needed to do our jobs. Military personnel
must understand their team members and the situation. Leaders with good
listening skills often make better decisions and have a stronger bond with
their Airmen. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.14.4. <b class="calibre2">Pick the
Right Tool for the Job: Informative, Critical, or Empathic Listening.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal45">There are different situations where listening is
important and different reasons to listen. Everyone must understand </p>

<p class="msonormal151">the importance for acknowledging and identifying these
differences because appropriate listening behaviors in one situation are
sometimes inappropriate in another situation. </p>

<p class="msonormal65">14.14.4.1. <b class="calibre2">Informative
Listening.</b> In informative listening, the listener’s primary concern is to
understand information exactly as transmitted. A successful listening outcome
occurs when the listener understands the message exactly as the sender
intended. Suggestions for improving informative listening are to: </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.14.4.1.1. <b class="calibre2">Keep
an Open Mind.</b> If the primary goal is to understand the message, set aside
your preconceptions about the topic and just listen. </p>

<p class="msonormal65">14.14.4.1.2. <b class="calibre2">Listen
as if You Had to Teach It.</b> Typically, we expend more effort to understand a
subject when we know that we have to teach a subject to someone else. By taking
this approach, we have the mental fortitude to focus longer, ask questions when
we do not understand, and think more deeply on a topic. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.14.4.1.3. <b class="calibre2">Take
Notes.</b> Focus on main points, and do not attempt to capture everything. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.14.4.1.4. <b class="calibre2">Respond
and Ask Appropriate Questions.</b> Good informative listening questions help
you clarify and confirm your understanding of the message. </p>

<p class="msonormal86">14.14.4.1.5. <b class="calibre2">Exploit
the Time Gap Between Thinking and Speaking Speeds.</b> The average speaking
rate is 180 words per minute; the average processing rate is 500 words per
minute. Use this extra time to mentally repeat, forecast, summarize, and
paraphrase the speaker’s remarks. </p>

<p class="msonormal69">14.14.4.2.<b class="calibre2">
Critical Listening.</b> Critical listening is usually thought of as the sum of
informative listening and critical thinking. The listener is actively analyzing
and evaluating the message the speaker is sending. Critical listening is
appropriate when seeking input to a decision, evaluating the quality of staff
work or a subordinate’s capabilities, or conducting research. Suggestions for
improving critical listening are to: </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.14.4.2.1. <b class="calibre2">Take
Notes. </b>As with informative listening, focus on main points, and do not attempt
to capture everything. </p>

<p class="msonormal47">14.14.4.2.2. <b class="calibre2">Listen
as if You Had to Grade It.</b> One of the few things more difficult than
teaching is grading another’s work. By taking this approach, we have the mental
fortitude to focus longer, ask questions when we do not understand, and think
more deeply on a topic. </p>

<p class="msonormal70">14.14.4.2.3. <b class="calibre2">Exploit
the Time Gap Between Thinking and Speaking Speeds.</b> Critical listening is
different from informational listening in that you need to try to understand
first and evaluate second. Even when you are listening critically, do not
mentally argue with the speaker until the message is complete. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.14.4.2.4. <b class="calibre2">Ask
Appropriate Questions.</b> Good critical listening questions will be probing in
nature to thoroughly evaluate the intellectual content of the speaker’s
message. </p>

<p class="msonormal152">14.14.4.3.<b class="calibre2">
Empathic Listening. </b>Empathic listening is often useful when communication
is emotional or when the relationship between speaker and listener is just as
important as the message. Use this type of listening as a first step in the
listening process, a prerequisite to informational or critical listening.
Empathic listening is often appropriate during mentoring and nonpunitive
counseling sessions and is very helpful when communicating with family members.

<p class="msonormal95"><b class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">Section 14E—Electronic Communications
and the Internet </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre2">14.15. E-mail. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal54">E-mail is defined as the electronic transmission of
information over computer-based messaging systems. Recent technological
advancements have increased opportunities for more timely, efficient, and
effective text-based communications. These advancements facilitated the
explosive growth of e-mail use throughout the Air Force at all levels. To
uphold a commitment to secure messaging, the Air Force has established
guidelines to ensure standardized and responsible use by all Air Force members.
</p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre2">14.16. Identity
Management.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal153">A vital element for messaging security is the
implementation of public key infrastructure and common access cards for
identity management. Public key infrastructure allows for the authentication of
the sender identity using a digital signature and the encryption and decryption
of the message. Users of Department of Defense electronic messaging are
directed to follow current Air Force guidance for the use of public key
infrastructure to sign and encrypt e-mail. </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre2">14.17. Defense Message
System.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal154">The defense message system is the core messaging system of
record for the Department of Defense and the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal153">Defense message system is a flexible,
commercial-off-the-shelf based application that provides messaging services to
all Department of Defense users (including deployed tactical users) and
interfaces to other United States government agencies, allied forces, and
defense contractors. </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre2">14.18. Air Force
Organizational Messaging.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal60">Organization simple mail transfer protocol mailboxes may
be used for all organizational messaging requirements unless usage of defense
message system is required in support of combatant command responsibilities. </p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre2">14.19. Individual
Responsibilities. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">All government communications systems are subject
to monitoring, interception, search, and seizure for all authorized purposes.
Government-provided messaging systems are for official use and limited
authorized personal use only. Individuals must: </p>

<p class="msonormal60">14.19.1. Maintain responsibility for the content of their
electronic messages and ensure that messages sent adhere to acceptable use of
Internet-based capabilities. </p>

<p class="msonormal155">14.19.2. Maintain sent and received information
according to Air Force records management directives. Emails may be subject to
requests under the freedom of information act, litigation, and court orders. If
requested, individuals are responsible for reviewing messages in email accounts
and all backups to locate responsive material. </p>

<p class="msonormal60">14.19.3. Adhere to local policy on sending electronic
messages to a large number of recipients. Digital images, as well as mass
distribution of smaller messages, may delay other traffic, overload the system,
and subsequently cause system failure. </p>

<p class="msonormal60">14.19.4. Adhere to local policy when sending an electronic
message to mail distribution lists. Use web pages or electronic public folders
for unofficial electronic messages (i.e., booster club activities, etc.). </p>

<p class="msonormal60">14.19.5. Only reply to electronic messages that absolutely
require a response and minimize the use of the Reply to All function. </p>

<p class="msonormal60">14.19.6. Bear sole responsibility for material sent. </p>

<p class="msonormal60">14.19.7. Properly coordinate and staff electronic messages
according to local directives. </p>

<p class="msonormal60">14.19.8. Take appropriate action on non-delivery notices
or message rejects to ensure messages reach the intended recipient. </p>

<p class="msonormal60">14.19.9. Not auto-forward electronic messages from the
.mil domain to a commercial internet service provider. </p>

Effective Interview </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre2">14.23. Introduction.</b>
</p>

<p class="msonormal54">Many Air Force positions require a job interview.
Knowing how to prepare for and conduct yourself during this process can go a
long way toward helping you get that special duty or some other much-coveted
job in the Air Force. This section is designed to help you prepare for and
succeed in conducting an effective Air Force interview: </p>

<p class="msonormal163">14.23.1. <b class="calibre2">Purpose of Interviews.</b> So, you’ve found a new job in the Air
Force—one that requires special talents and experience; one that requires you
to gather letters of recommendation, submit a resume, and provide copies of
your last five enlisted performance reports (EPR); <b class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">and</i></b> one that requires you
to sit through a job interview. If you’ve ever completed a special duty
assignment or worked at certain headquarters assignments, chances are you’ve
already sat through a job interview. However, for many Airmen out there, the
Air Force job interview is a new experience—one requiring preparation,
practice, and perseverance. </p>

<p class="msonormal47">14.23.1.1. Before you set off for that interview,
there are a few things you will need to understand about the interview process.
First, you need to understand the purpose of the job interview. All job
interviews are designed with one goal in mind: to find the right person for a
particular job. As military members, many of you will sit through job
interviews to get that special job or position you’ve been looking for.
Understanding that employers may have to interview several member for the
position, should give you some respect for the process and help you understand
that your goal in an interview is to convince the interviewer that <b class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">you</i></b>
are the right person for the job. </p>

<p class="msonormal164">14.23.1.2. The second thing you should know about interviews
is that they are a two-way process. You are not only interviewing for a job;
you are interviewing the prospective employer to see if you actually want the
job. Are you willing to spend the next 2-3 years of your career in this
organization? Are you willing to work under the conditions laid out in the job
description? Are you willing to make a permanent change of station for the
position? There are a host of other concerns you should have in mind when
preparing for the interview, many of which should center on your desire for the
job and working in the new organization. </p>

<p class="msonormal97">14.23.1.3. Third, you need to understand that
interviews are information-sharing events between you and the interviewer. Your
job is to convince the interviewer that your unique knowledge, skills, and
abilities are a perfect match for the position you’re seeking. Conversely, the
interviewer’s job is to sift through reams of information gathered from
numerous interviews and eventually match the <b class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">right</i></b> person to the
position. The interviewer is basically asking each interviewee the same
question: “Why should I hire <b class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">you</i></b>?” while all interviewees are
also highlighting their particular skills for the job. </p>

<p class="msonormal165">14.23.2. <b class="calibre94">Types of
Interviews.</b> As you’ve just read, the purpose of the interview is to find
the best person for the job. However, interviews can be conducted in several
different ways. 14.23.2.1. <b class="calibre94">Face-to-face
Interviews:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal50">14.23.2.1.1. Face-to-face interviews usually take place in
one of two formats: the individual interview or the panel interview. The
individual interview may be the person who will supervise you or someone higher
in the chain of command. Hiring decisions are often made based on this type of
interview. Count on discussing your skills, experience, and training, and how
they all relate to the job. </p>

<p class="msonormal70">14.23.2.1.2. A selection panel or board interview
is frequently used when organizations are filling a managerial position.
Usually, three or more people sit on the board, and all candidates are asked
the same questions. A selection board interview usually involves more
structured questions than an individual interview. This interview can be
stressful because you have to answer questions from several people. Be sure to
make eye contact with everyone on the panel. When answering a question, you
should make eye contact with the person asking the question. </p>

<p class="msonormal166"><span class="calibre1"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal167"><span class="calibre1"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal64"><span class="calibre1"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal168">14.23.2.2. <b class="calibre2">Phone
Interviews: </b></p>

<p class="msonormal70">14.23.2.2.1. The phone interview is another
strategy organizations use to select highly qualified Airmen. In this
situation, the hiring organization interviews applicants over the phone. These
interviews are sometimes used to make first-round cuts to the applicant pool. </p>

<p class="msonormal69">14.23.2.2.2. If you apply for a special assignment,
chances are the location will be away from your current assignment. In this
case, the hiring organization usually conducts the entire interview over the
phone. In these situations, there are no second chances to make a good
impression, and decisions are based strictly on the phone interview. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.23.3. <b class="calibre2">Interviewing:<span class="calibre1">  </span></b></p>

<p class="msonormal168">14.23.3.1. <b class="calibre2">Pre-interview
Preparations:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal49">14.23.3.1.1. One of the first things you need to do
to prepare for any Air Force job interview is to carefully study the job
advertisement or position description. This provides you with information on
the particular knowledge, skills, and abilities for which the hiring
organization is looking. What experience or skills are required for the job? Do
you have the required experience or skills? Note the key responsibilities of
the job and try to match your knowledge, skills, and abilities to those
requirements and you should make the connections now because you will be asked
to do the very same thing during the interview. This first step helps you
understand how your talents measure up to the requirements for the position
you’re seeking. </p>

<p class="msonormal49">14.23.3.1.2. The next step is to gather all
required information and documentation for the application process. In many
cases, you will need to submit past EPRs, a personnel report on individual
personnel, a resume, letters of recommendation, and a cover letter. A targeted
resume and letters of recommendation should highlight your particular
knowledge, skills, and abilities, and relate them to the position for which
you’re applying. A cover letter should target one or two strengths not
mentioned in your EPRs, resume, or letters of recommendation. </p>

<p class="msonormal49">14.23.3.1.3. One important aspect to consider
before the interview is to conduct research on the mission and history of the
hiring organization before the interview. Who are the commander and senior
enlisted members of the organization? How large is the organization? What are
the mission and vision statements? If you know someone who works in the
organization, you should call him or her and ask some particular questions
about the organization. Are there any mission changes in the foreseeable
future? How many enlisted personnel are assigned there? Has the organization
done anything noteworthy in the past 2 or 3 years? The more you know about the
organization, the better job you will do of convincing potential employers that
you care about the organization, as well as the job you’re seeking. </p>

<p class="msonormal86">14.23.3.1.4. When preparing for any interview,
think about and write down your strengths and weaknesses. Identify two or three
strengths that target the knowledge, skills, and abilities in the job advertisement.
Next, identify one or two weaknesses that can be turned into strengths (for
example, I’m detail oriented but not a micromanager). Putting your strengths
and weakness on paper allows you to study and become intimately familiar with
them and builds your confidence as you prepare for the interview. As you write
down your strengths and weaknesses, develop specific examples that highlight
your skills. You will be asked to provide examples of your experience during
the interview. Developing examples <b class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">before</i></b> the interview can only help
make the interview flow more smoothly. </p>

<p class="msonormal70">14.23.3.1.5. Use job descriptions and bullets from
past EPRs to develop possible questions employers might ask during the
interview. Remember, employers know exactly what they are looking for, and they
are using the interview process to find the right person to fill the position.
Put yourself in the interviewer’s shoes and develop a set of questions you
would ask if you were them. Then, develop answers to the questions you just
came up with. If your EPRs were sent as part of the application package, you
can bet some of the questions will be targeted toward specific achievements
highlighted. Include specific, concrete examples that not only highlight your
skills but also tie directly to the specific requirements of the job. Some
examples of areas to concentrate on are: (1) problem-solving skills; (2)
thoughts on Air Force transformation; (3) team-building skills; (4) how you
support the Chief of Staff of the Air Force priorities; (5) leadership
philosophy; (6) ability to adapt and work in fast-paced environments; (7)
handling criticism; and (8) decision making ability. </p>

<p class="msonormal70">14.23.3.1.6. Also, be able to answer the following
questions: Why should I hire <b class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">you</i></b>? How soon can you report? If
applicable, how does your family feel about the move? Where do you see yourself
in 2 to 3 years? Are there any personal issues that may prevent you from
accepting or performing in this position? </p>

<p class="msonormal47">14.23.3.1.7. Develop a list of questions to ask
potential employers. Interviewers expect candidates to ask intelligent,
thoughtful questions concerning the organization and the nature of the work.
The nature and quality of your questions reveals your interest in the
organization and the position you’re seeking. Ensure your questions are
employer-centered; avoid self-centered questions that might indicate you are
primarily interested in knowing about the benefits of the position. Potential
questions should center on (1) duties and responsibilities of the job; (2)
possible mission changes in the organization; (3) chain of command or lines of
responsibility; (4) unique requirements of the organization; and (5) a typical
day in the organization. </p>

<p class="msonormal164">14.23.3.1.8. Finally, you need to practice, practice,
practice. Practice how you will get out of your car. Practice how you will walk
into the room. Practice how you will answer questions. Practice how you will
ask questions. Practice your nonverbals. Practice anything you think you will
do before, during, or after the interview. This will make you more comfortable
and confident and will help you perform better during the interview. If
possible, have friends and family conduct mock interviews. Practice in front of
a mirror if mock interviews are impossible or impractical. The bottom line here
is practice, practice, practice! </p>

<p class="msonormal169">14.23.3.2. <b class="calibre2">Listening
Skills.</b> Listening during the interview is as essential to your success as
talking openly and honestly about knowledge, skills, and abilities. Concentrate
on what is being said and how it is said, rather than how you are doing. By
listening to the interviewer’s statements, comments, and questions, you gain a
better understanding of the organization and what workplace would be like to
work there. If you pay close attention, you can probably hear the “questions
behind the questions” your interviewer asks. In other words, pay close
attention and read between the lines for what is <b class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">not</i> </b>being said in the
interview, and you can probably pick up useful nuggets of information that can
benefit you during the interview. For instance, if the interviewer continually
asks about your ability to develop and motivate teams or seems to refer to getting
teams to work better, you may pick up a possible team-development issue within
the organization. With this information, you can sell your ability to lead and
motivate teams and possibly land yourself the job. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.23.4. <b class="calibre2">The Actual
Interview. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal49">As mentioned earlier, most will be interviewed in
one of two ways: by phone or in person. If conducted by phone, the interview
begins the moment you pick up the phone and ends once you hang up. On the other
hand, personal interviews begin the moment you get out of your car and end when
you drive out of the parking lot. Either way, the interview is the one best
chance you have of “selling yourself” to any potential employer. Whether you
interview by phone or in person, there are certain rules you should keep in
mind: (1) keep your answers concise; limited to about 2-3 minutes; (2) provide
specific examples of your skills and achievements; (3) tie your strengths to
the requirements of the job; (4) ask questions; (5) maintain a conversational
tone throughout the interview; and (6) keep important documents nearby (such as
EPRs, resumes, letters of reference, etc.). </p>

<p class="msonormal168">14.23.4.1. <b class="calibre2">The Phone
Interview. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal97">To some, the phone interview may seem less
important than a personal interview because the interview is conducted from
different locations and removed from direct observation of the interviewer.
However, in many aspects, the phone interview is more difficult than a personal
interview. For instance, in a personal interview you can usually gauge how the
interview is going by paying attention to the interviewer’s nonverbals. On the
other hand, with a phone interview there are no visual cues to tell you how you
are doing. Therefore, there are some areas you will have to pay close attention
to if you want to successfully navigate through a phone interview. Here are a
few tips to help you succeed: </p>

<p class="msonormal57">14.23.4.1.1. Smile during the interview, just as
you would in a personal interview. While hiding behind a phone allows you to
disguise your body language, there is no way you can disguise your vocal cues
due to nonverbals. Smiling during a phone interview keeps you energetic and
helps project enthusiasm. </p>

<p class="msonormal169">14.23.4.1.2. Keep a mirror in front of you during
the interview. This allows you to see your own expressions and will help to
ensure you are smiling and paying attention to your body language. Just because
the interviewer can’t see you doesn’t mean he or she is not listening for
details of your nonverbal responses during the interview. A mirror also ensures
you conduct yourself in much the same way you would in a personal interview.
You would not put your feet on a desk during a personal interview, would you?
Of course not! So keep your feet off your desk during a phone interview.
Believe it or not, your body posture naturally reflects in your voice. If your
posture is slacking while you are on the phone, you can bet your vocal tone
will convey that. Keeping a mirror in front of you will help you focus on your
body language and nonverbal responses. </p>

<p class="msonormal49">14.23.4.1.3. Know when to speak, and then when to
stop. In a personal interview, you can usually tell from the interviewer’s
nonverbals when you need to wrap up an answer or move on. Phone interviews are
often filled with long, silent pauses. Do not feel that you need to fill that
dead space with conversation. Pay close attention to the tone of the
interviewer’s voice and know when to stop talking and move on. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.23.4.1.4. Develop notes for telephone interviews. These
notes should include a list of your strengths and weaknesses and how your
skills match organizational needs. Develop a list of potential questions
employers might ask, along with possible responses. Practice delivering
responses so that you will be ready to give polished answers in a clear
confident tone. Do not memorize canned answers since they are likely to sound
canned over the phone. Instead, use the script to trigger appropriate responses
that sound both spontaneous and energetic. Do not forget to ask questions.
Questions for potential employers should be part of your script and should be
kept readily available during the interview. Keep in mind, the real key to
success in any interview is practice. </p>

<p class="msonormal168">14.23.4.2. <b class="calibre2">The
Personal Interview:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal97">14.23.4.2.1. In many cases, personal interviews
begin the moment you get out of your car and do not end until you drive away.
Many prospective employers will observe you as you walk from your car to the
front door of the building or office. Others will purposely let you sit in a
waiting area for 10 to 20 minutes. All of this is designed to create tension
and provide the employer an opportunity to observe your bearing before the
actual interview begins. We cannot overstate that you are on the interviewing
clock even though you are not sitting in an interviewing room. </p>

<p class="msonormal70">14.23.4.2.2. In job interviews, potential employers
judge you on how you look and act, not just on what you say. Your actions,
mannerisms, and appearance are reflected in your body language. They give
nonverbal information about your work-related skills, attitudes, and values.
Research shows that 65 percent of meaning in any interaction is conveyed
nonverbally. In many interviews, nonverbal cues are just as important as verbal
information in determining who is hired. After all, each person the
organization interviews is probably qualified for the job. Therefore, you want
to appear <b class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">more</i></b> qualified than anyone else—do not let your nonverbals cost
you a job. </p>

<p class="msonormal170">14.23.4.2.3. The first thing required for the
interview is to ensure you are wearing the proper uniform. You should get this
information before the interview, but check before the interview to make sure.
Your dress and appearance is the first nonverbal message you send to any
employer, so ensure you are squared away and nothing is out of place. </p>

<p class="msonormal69">14.23.4.2.4. Offer a firm (but not <b class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">too</i></b>
firm), warm, whole-hand handshake. Shake hands with both men and women the same
way. You would not give men and women different salutes, so do not offer them
different handshakes. Practice your handshake before the interview. </p>

<p class="msonormal171">14.23.4.2.5. Make eye contact with the
interviewers. Your eyes are your most powerful communication tools, and many
interviewers use eye contact to determine enthusiasm, sincerity, and possible
inconsistencies in your responses. If you use natural eye contact, the
interview will become more like a conversation between acquaintances and you
will get over some of your nervousness. </p>

<p class="msonormal49">14.23.4.2.6. Sit up straight, but not stiff, and
lean slightly forward toward the interviewer. As the interview progresses, you
may want to mirror the body language of the interviewer. If the interviewer
takes a more relaxed posture, then you should relax too—but not too much. If
the interviewer is more formal, then you need to mirror that formal behavior. </p>

<p class="msonormal70">14.23.4.2.7. Use natural gestures. If you normally
use your hands to gesture as you talk, do so during the interview. Gestures
help you relax, convey enthusiasm, and release nervous energy. Be careful,
though, to avoid nervous gestures such as drumming your fingers, playing with a
pencil, jingling the change in your pocket, tapping your feet, etc. </p>

<p class="msonormal50">14.23.4.2.8. Speak clearly and evenly—not too fast, but
not too slow. Expression is a powerful way to show enthusiasm. Do not speak in
a monotone voice. Allow your volume to rise and fall, and pronounce words
clearly. Use good grammar and diction, and always think before you speak. The
interviewer will assess your communication skills based on how clearly you
express yourself. </p>

<p class="msonormal57">14.23.4.2.9. Notice the nonverbal cues of the
interviewer. His or her facial expressions will let you know how well he or she
is listening and may give you clues as to how you are doing. For instance, if
the interviewer seems distracted or inattentive, you will need to shorten your
answers, use examples, or ask questions. </p>

<p class="msonormal70">14.23.4.2.10. As the interview ends, take 2 to 3
minutes to summarize. This gives you a chance to end the interview on a
positive note, convey your interest in the position, and sell yourself one more
time. During the summary, recap one or two of the key points of the interview
and restate how your experience and skills match those required for the
position. </p>

<p class="msonormal84"><b class="calibre2">14.24. Post-interview
Actions:</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal153">14.24.1. Once the interview is complete, two things will
increase your chances of success and help you learn from your experience.
First, send a short (two or three paragraphs) thank-you note to the
organization with which you interviewed. The letter should be typed or
handwritten and should express your gratitude for the interview opportunity.
Restate your interest in the position and highlight any particularly noteworthy
points made in your conversation or anything you wish to further clarify. This
is also an opportunity to add anything you forgot or wish you had said in the
interview. Close the letter by mentioning that you will call in a few days to
inquire about the employer’s decision. Always mail the letter within a day or
two of the interview. </p>

<p class="msonormal153">14.24.2. The second thing is to make a few notes about the
interview. Record some of the questions asked and how you answered them. Write
down your strong and weak points from the interview. Make a list of what made
the interview successful, what you would change, and what you need to improve.
These notes can be invaluable information for you to review and work on for
future interviews.<b class="calibre2"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre2">14.25. Interview
Conclusion. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal28">The job interview is the most important step in any
job-search process. Many Airmen will undergo the rigors of an interview for
special positions during the course of their careers. Understanding the purpose
of the job interview and your role in successfully planning for and conducting
a proper interview can greatly increase your chances of landing a coveted job
in the Air Force. </p>

<p class="msonormal95"><b class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">Section 14G—Staff-Level
Communication </i></b></p>

<p class="msonormal27"><b class="calibre2">14.26. Spoken Communication
via the Meeting. </b></p>

<p class="msonormal60">Meetings are used to share information, solve problems,
plan, brainstorm, or motivate. Whatever their purpose, you need to know some
basics about conducting an effective meeting. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.26.1.<b class="calibre2"> Planning the
Meeting.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal172">Success or failure in a meeting can usually be traced to
the planning phase. The key issues associated with planning a meeting are
listed below. As you review these items, remember to check on what are standard
operating procedures in your organization. Meetings come in all flavors—from
totally spontaneous to highly structured and ceremonial. Most are in the
middle. If a group has been meeting regularly for a while, try to find out how
they have done business in the past. </p>

<p class="msonormal173">14.26.1.1. <b class="calibre2">Decide if
the Meeting is Appropriate.</b> If you can achieve the goal by speaking
face-to-face with one or two people, scheduling a formal meeting might not be
necessary. If the goal is to just pass on information, consider if sending an
e-mail is a viable and appropriate substitute for the meeting. </p>

<p class="msonormal144">14.26.1.2. <b class="calibre2">Define
the Purpose.</b> Every meeting should have a purpose and if there is no
purpose, you should not meet. When thinking about the purpose, define in terms
of the product wanted at the end of the meeting and what purpose will the
product be used for. </p>

<p class="msonormal174">14.26.1.3. <b class="calibre2">Decide
Who Should Be Invited.</b> Invite only those directly involved in the issues
being discussed. If you are trying to solve a problem or make a decision on a
controversial issue, make sure you have adequate representation from all groups
who have a voice in the decision. If you only invite people with one point of
view, your meeting will run smoothly, but your decision may not stand up later.<b class="calibre2"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal23">14.26.1.4. <b class="calibre2">Decide
Where and When the Meeting Should Occur.</b> Ensure the time is convenient for
the people who are required to be there, keep the meeting under an hour, or
plan for breaks. Finally, reserve the room. </p>

<p class="msonormal58">14.26.1.5. <b class="calibre2">Plan
for Capturing Meeting Information.</b> If this is not a routine meeting with an
appointed recorder, take a moment to think about how you will capture the
meeting information, both in the meeting itself and afterwards. </p>

<p class="msonormal126">14.26.1.5.1. <b class="calibre2">Capturing
Information during the Meeting.</b> This can be done by using standard
note-taking procedures. Ensuring your meeting place has either a dry erase
board, butcher paper, or other note-taking capabilities will assist in getting
this accomplished. </p>

<p class="msonormal175">14.26.1.5.2. <b class="calibre2">Capturing
Information after the Meeting.</b> Meeting minutes capture the process and
outcome of the meeting. Minutes “close the loop” on the meeting and let the
attendees know what was decided. </p>

<p class="msonormal176">14.26.1.6. <b class="calibre2">Send Out
an Agenda.</b> Create an agenda and send the agenda to attendees no later than
1 or 2 days before the meeting. The agenda should include the date, time,
location, and purpose of the meeting. This advance notice gives everyone an
opportunity to prepare their thoughts and know where the meeting is going
before they get there. </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.26.2.<b class="calibre2"> Running the
Meeting.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal45">Avoid dragging out a meeting unnecessarily.<b class="calibre2"> </b></p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.26.2.1. <b class="calibre2">Start on
Time; Stay on Time.</b> Meetings should start on time with an upbeat note, so
do not wait for tardy attendees. State your desired outcome. </p>

<p class="msonormal64"><span class="calibre1"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.26.2.2. <b class="calibre2">Follow
the Agenda.</b> People generally don’t like when a meeting deviates from the
agenda. Review the agenda in the opening minutes of the meeting to remind
everyone of the goals and plan for the meeting. </p>

<p class="msonormal164">14.26.2.3. <b class="calibre2">Understand
Group Dynamics.</b> If you are in charge of a group that will meet over a
period of time, you should learn the basics about group dynamics. In group
dynamics which will be experienced in meetings, teams or groups move through
predictable stages. To avoid frustration, becoming familiar with these stages
is important. </p>

<p class="msonormal70">14.26.2.3.1. <b class="calibre2">Forming
Stage. </b>When a team is forming, members cautiously explore the boundaries of
acceptable group behavior. The forming stage is a stage of transition from
individual to member status, and of testing the leader’s guidance, both
formally and informally. Because so much is going on to distract the members’
attention in the beginning, the team accomplishes little, if anything, that is
concerned with the project goals. Do not be overly concerned; this is perfectly
normal! </p>

<p class="msonormal50">14.26.2.3.2. <b class="calibre2">Storming
Stage.</b> Probably the most difficult stage for the team is the storming
stage. The team members begin to realize the task is different and more
difficult than imagined and they become testy, accusatory, or overzealous.
Impatient about the lack of progress, but still too inexperienced to know much
about decision making or the scientific approach, members argue about what
actions the team should take. They try to rely solely on their personal and
professional experience, resisting any need for collaborating with other team
members. Their behavior means team members have little energy to spend on
progressing toward the team’s goal, but they are beginning to understand one
another. </p>

<p class="msonormal97">14.26.2.3.3. <b class="calibre2">Norming
Stage. </b>During the norming stage, members reconcile competing loyalties and
responsibilities. They accept the team, team ground rules (or “norms”), their
roles in the team, and the individuality of fellow members. Emotional conflict
is reduced as previously competitive relationships become more cooperative. As
team members begin to work out their differences, they now have more time and
energy to spend on the project. Thus, they are able to at last start making
significant strides. </p>

<p class="msonormal49">14.26.2.3.4. <b class="calibre2">Performing
Stage.</b> By the time of the performing stage, the team has settled their
relationships and expectations. At last, team members have discovered and accepted
each other’s strengths and weaknesses and learned what their roles are. The
team is now an effective, cohesive unit. They can begin performing—diagnosing
and solving problems, and choosing and implementing changes. You can tell when
your team has reached the performing stage because you start getting a lot of
work done—finally! </p>

<p class="msonormal24">14.26.3. <b class="calibre2">Follow up:
Preparing Meeting Minutes.</b> </p>

<p class="msonormal97">Follow up involves sending out meeting minutes and
starting the whole cycle over again. Prepare meeting minutes in the official
memorandum format. Minutes are a clear summary of the participants’ comments
and document planned or completed actions. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.26.3.1. Date the minutes the day they are distributed.
The names of members present may be listed in two columns to save space. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.26.3.2. Place information regarding a future meeting in
the last paragraph. </p>

<p class="msonormal69">14.26.3.3. When a person signs a paper as a member
of a board or committee, the signature element indicates that person’s status
on that board or committee, not any other position the person may hold. To
approve the minutes, type “Approved as written” two lines below the recorder’s
signature block, followed by the approving authority’s signature block. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.26.3.4. Minutes are typed either single or
double-spaced, with additional space between items of business and paragraphs. </p>

<p class="msonormal43">14.26.3.5. The format should be neat and orderly, paying
particular attention to uniformity of margins and text. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.26.3.6. Spell names correctly, use acceptable grammar,
and construct and punctuate sentences well. All verbs should be in past tense. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.26.3.7. The order of the minutes usually coincides with
the order of the agenda and generally includes items such as: </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.26.3.7.1. Kind of meeting (regular, special, etc.). </p>

<p class="msonormal177">14.26.3.7.2. Day, date, time, and place of meeting. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.26.3.7.3. The word “Minutes” in the heading. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.26.3.7.4. Name of the meeting body. </p>

<p class="msonormal45">14.26.3.7.5. Opening paragraph; that is, The Executive

<p class="msonormal45">14.26.3.7.6. Members present and absent. </p>

<p class="msonormal42">14.26.3.7.7. Action taken on last meeting’s minutes. </p>

<p class="msonormal179">Use the staff summary sheet to summarize staff
work, request action, or forward information. Staff summary sheets often
contain several handwritten notes before reaching the approval authority;
therefore, they do not require the same level of perfection (error-free typing,
etc.) as the correspondence they may cover. Refer to Air Force Handbook 33-337
for information on filling out the staff summary sheet. </p>

<p class="msonormal153">Electronic staff summary requiring your group or wing
commander’s signature should be sent through your internal channels via e-mail.
The office of primary responsibility transmits the package via e-mail to the
first reviewer to coordinate and comment. The first reviewer should forward
(never reply) the package with comments (if any) to the next reviewer. This
procedure is repeated until the last reviewer has coordinated on the package.
The last reviewer forwards the entire package back to the office of primary
responsibility. </p>

<p class="msonormal54">Use the staff study report to analyze a clearly
defined problem, identify conclusions, and make recommendations. Not all
organizations routinely use a staff study report, but it is an accepted format
for a problem-solution report in both Air Force and Joint Staffs. The staff
study report should represent completed staff work. This means the staff member
has solved a problem and presented a complete solution to the boss. The
solution should be complete enough that the decision maker has only to approve
or disapprove. </p>

<p class="msonormal198">Clear, concise, well-thought-out, and well-composed
communication is essential for meeting the needs of today’s Air Force. We are
all involved in speaking and writing to some extent. Therefore, we must become
proficient at the methods we use. The meeting is an important forum for
providing information, solving problems, and answering questions. Written
communication is also another area crucial to meeting the Air Force mission.
Fortunately, we have several instruments at our disposal to help us with the
process. The staff summary sheet, bullet background paper, trip report, and
staff study report all serve a useful purpose and are tools that help
facilitate staff-level communication.<b class="calibre2"> </b></p>
